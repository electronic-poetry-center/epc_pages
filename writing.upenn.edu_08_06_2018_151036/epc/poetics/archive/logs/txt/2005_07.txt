 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

                   [ see http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

KEYWORDS:

>> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...


        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

Here`s how:

~ Set www-links to ->  http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/12hr.html

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been
over twenty-five years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image is
like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at
topica.com /subscribe 12hr-isbn-jpeg

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some opportunities
still exist for financially assisting the publication of editions of large
(33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones or extended-black
quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three
web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed cheque/check:
$5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images retained longer
than 12 hours.

Mark, While I think it's great that you feel comfortable talking so
candidly on this list isn't the lingo a bit seventies? Wouldn't 'woman' be

OKAY, I did it---finally testing the waters and succumbing to the
BLOGOSPHERE

Just up---first two posts.

1. Oakland "My" Oakland---some loose tentative thoughts about the WAYANS
BROTHERS hope to build a movie studio in Oakland, the local RAGazine THE
BOOTY CRACK, the CULTURAL SEGREGRATION of blacks and whites in Oaktown
against a backdrop of gentrification, etc.

2. (of potentially more interest here) Was Robert Creeley "stupid about
gender"? Some thoughts, and a defense, not just of Creeley's love poetry and
prose, but of the kind of thinking he did, and a plea that such
thinking/feeling may still be relevant today....(warning: a little "over the
top" this may be, written very shortly after his death, while very shaken
up)....

Oh yeah, here's the link---

Dear Chris S.,

Read yr creeley thoughts w/ great interest as I am trying to (un)formulate
thoughts abt dear Bob myself. Some friends, knowing he was the central
contemporary poet for me, have asked abt his life with women. I can say that
his generosity was unlimited, and to me as a young poet in Cambridge in the
early '70s, when I asked if I cd talk to him abt poetry once that summer, he
sd, "Come every week." So I did. He let Celia Gilbert and me interview him.
He wrote a blurb for my first book. He came to Boston to read for Oxfam
America readings I was organizing. In recent years he came to my classes at
the NEng Conservatory of Music, even Xeroxing handouts himself. Sure, he
loved to talk and be with people, but that's part of the point. One felt his
kindness and kindliness.

At the same time, he was a kind of Dostoyevsky character in his poetry.
There was a guy, Robert Creeley, who appeared in his poems. This guy was the
existential person of our time. I read Creeley always thinking of his poems
as current and newly meaningful, because he was asking about and tentatively
coming to statements, filled with feeling, about what it means to be
alive,in our time & in any time.What we all have in common was his subject,
I feel. Denise Levertov and Adrienne Rich were the other essential poets for
me, and I never felt conflict going from Rich to Creeley. Each was vast and
sincere while questioning the notion of sincerity.

Three times I've gone to visit Bob at Tulip Lane in Mt. Auburn Cemetery and
each time what comes to mind, after the existential shock that he doesn't
exist now, is what he said, "If it isn't fun, don't do it." Is that
gender-laden? I dunno, but it reminds me as well as any guy, once I can get
past what I mist do, to choose.

I wrote some poems for Bob in the weeks after he died. One of them is a
realization that came for the first time in my life about the importance of
art, which had often seemed flimsy in the face of humanity's suffering. I
was standing outside thinking nothing means anything bec Bob died, people
die, and I thought, Why did people love Bob so much? Because he was a great
poet! He was able to say what most people cannot, and what we long to hear
other people say. One of the few times on this earth when a human being,
lovely to see and hear as he was, went beyond sex.

Bob was called a lyric poet and an innovative poet. Impossibly, he managed
both.

Thank you Ruth for sharing your experiences with us. Being an  existentialist
myself is what led me to Creeley's work. The more I learn about  his
generosity and see him on video as he taught and read his poems, I  learn to
appreciate the man himself even more than his poetry!

The Gold Diggers and Island

He lived long 'nuf

I like that, Steve.

no one should tell us
what's true
we want company
not sympathy
maybe empathy
certainly not epistemology
though it's phenomenal
that we can share an apple

Thanks for writing, Mary. Of course you're right we loved the man more than
the poems but the man was the poems, too. Glad to know of a another
existentialist.

Hi Ruth---

hey, thanks for writing. i like what you say---especially about the
"dostoyevsky character" in the poems--the whole question of the often
solitary dark character in so many of the poems and how that might seem
"at odds" with how so many of us knew him socially....

Once I saw him at a panel discussion in Albany in 1995
and he kept on making fun of the phrase (and stance), "wandered lonely as a
cloud" and I always thought that he, more than many poets, really
HAD TO remind himself to do that in order to be able to let go
and be so PRESENT with people. Also, in my copy of LIFE AND DEATH he simply
wrote the phrase "IN THE CITY!" and at first I thought he was quoting
something from one of his poems in that book, as many poets do when they
sign their books, but it turns out he was just GIDDY to be in NYC.

What do I make of all this? Maybe he was able to wrestle so much of
the solitary alienated demon out in the act of writing and that allowed
him or helped him really appreciate people when he was actually WITH them,
and that back-and-forth is surely not unique to Creeley, but I love the
particular ways he went about navigating or "negotiating" that--(okay, not
very profound this.....Sorry...)

the Dostoyevsky reference also brings up a more general point
about poetry---especially poetry that can be both, as you say,
"lyric and innovative"----Why is it that people are more inclined to
be JUDGEMENTAL when a lyric poet/persona explores some "unsavory"
aspects of the "self" than when a novelist or playwright creates
"characters"?

I have my own theories about that, but I'll save it for later---
For now, I just want to say I appreciate the fact that you (and Mary Jo and
others) are less interested in engaging in the kind of (spurious) moral
JUDGEMENT I was taking issue with---
I mean, of course, we "SHOULD" be a lot of things we're not,
but thankfully that didn't stop Creeley from giving voice to
a lot of other things....

Thanks for the note, Charles. Although not as well known as Creeley, I hope readers unfamiliar with Lorenzo's impact on the development of contemporary poetry, as opposed to "simply" a founder of the Black Arts Movement, will begin to (re) read him.

Oh, this is sad! He was only 60, and such a wide range of work, much of it
still very hard to find. I hope someone puts out a big collected/ or at
least a more comprehensive selected soon. Maybe the poetics list policy
of not posting poems to this list could be WAIVED since many people don't
know his work that well?

I just saw this message as I was heading out the door -- I am bereft -- Lorenzo
was among the finest people I have ever known and worked with -- a beautiful
poet and a generous friend.

Just to join my voice to the others lamenting Lorenzo Thomas's death
and praising his life.

Brilliant, humane, hilarious, his work, like the way he lived his life
in poetry, always made me think: yes, that's how you do it.

Another irreplaceable force for good, gone.

Sadly,

Steve

p.s. Here are the closing sentences of Alice Notley's appreciation of
Thomas's work, included in COMING AFTER (U of Michigan, 2005):

"Lorenzo Thomas's poetry often exemplifies a natural reaction to an
unnatural stress. But it's not just reaction; Thomas's poetry insists
on the primacy of making poetry as a natural activity. One may be
protesting but one is simultaneously making something, as a way of
being in a life that continuously asserts its temporality. One has to
be in that life, not merely protest it, or deliver a message as if the
point-blank urgency of the message can fill up all of time. This is an
obvious thing to say, but how much of poetry shows that its making is
as important as its message, that it amused the writer to write it, and
to that extent amuses the reader because both writer and reader are
alive with real hours to fill? A poem may not change the world right
away, but it will _be_, and thus change, the time of those who read or
perform it for as long as the performance lasts" (106-07).

It is with great sorrow that I learn of the death of Lorenzo Thomas.  Lorenzo
was a student of mine in a poetry workshop at Queens College of the City
University of New York.  It was a privilige to have Lorenzo as a student.  I mourn
his loss.

ahhh...the card i wrote to him is still sitting, stamped, on the
kitchen table...telling him what pleasure his work has brought me
over the years, and what an honor it was to participate in a recent
ASA panel on his work...now he won't get it...not that that's the
saddest thing about his parting...but i am so thankful i got to know
his work in time to praise it to his face...it doesn't always happen
that way...another brother gone, what a loss. and he was just
starting to publish like a maniac again...

That thoughts invest themselves in flesh

That you have 30,000 shots at immortality
But only one you dare not miss at being rich
Or at the least escape the nag of destitution

That maybe exercise shows on TV

That sound bodies just
Amplify our empty minds

That platitudes contain a grant of wisdom

And fortune=E2=80=99s a rush hour train that doesn=E2=80=99t wait

To really live means needing other people
That whatever that means love
Could conquer hate

Thanks for the bad and expected news, Charles.
I remember that the first time or second time I saw a poem of his it
was in a little magazine that spelled his name Toumes.

"....all of us can say what we are thinking or what we are feeling at a
given moment. The reason one would try to phrase it into a formal
statement is that one wants to say something on more than one level...."

That's from an interview (a really great interview) with Lorenzo Thomas
in the spring 1999 issue of Callaloo. For any number of reasons, and it
is a thing pulled from a much wider context than is even literally
suggested, it's been a guiding point of thought for me since I read it.
The most basic thing being the most important in that instance, I
think, which has stretched out into some years. On the one hand we keep
losing these extraordinary people, and I hate it, but I feel blessed to
have had a chance to spend a little time talking with Lorenzo and a lot
of time, continuing, with his work.

"....Art I think of as the practice of a skill, and that is what the
word means anyway. Artifice is what we're talking about: useful human
arts. So the first idea about art is that there is a particular skill
that is learned and carefully practiced. Therefore, it is historical
and localized to some extent. You learn it from somebody; you learn a
particular manner of doing something; and then in your  career you work
to perfecting that and being able to hand on the skill to others that
you meet along the way. You ask people, "How do you do this?" And you
tell them, "This is the wayI do it: This is something that I found out
along the way," to make it more effective or more brilliant, or easier,
or whatever. So at that point, what is universal is the effectiveness
of the art, right? If it's an art that is supposed to affect our
emotions, then the question is, does it move you, does this touch your
heart, does this make you feel something about other human beings, does
it make you understand hatred and love and disappointment more clearly
than you have in your own muddled reflections upon your own life?
(laughter) If it does that, then this is an effective art. An effective
performance. An effective form...."

"If you keep doing the time step long enough, people applaud!"
--Donald O'Connor

That's the epigraph to Lorenzo's 2004 chapbook TIME STEP -- here's the first
poem


Downtown Boom

There are no gospel singers
Anymore

On the corners
They held down for Jesus
Valets park cars
At restaurants for fancy people
On expense accts or dates

So many times
People come up to me
And say, Billy
Hey wait a minute
You not Billy!

You can see the new ballpark
Just past the courthouse

But which way is redemption?

SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE SEPT. 24-26 ANTI-WAR MOBILIZATION IN =
WASHINGTON, D.C.!
Leaflets and website banners now available online
Distribute and repost widely!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

People from all around the United States are already making plans to =
join United for Peace and Justice for three major days of action against =
the war in Washington, D.C., from September 24-26.=20

For this mobilization to be truly massive and reflective of the solid =
anti-war majority in the country, we need to begin spreading the word =
now -- in every community, large and small; at summer festivals, =
concerts, and gatherings; on progressive and activist listservs; and =
throughout the blogosphere. The political momentum in Congress is =
finally beginning to turn against the Iraq war -- we need to converge in =
Washington in vast numbers this September to build on this momentum and =
hold Bush and Congress accountable for the death and destruction.=20


United for Peace and Justice has created several new resources to help =
you do exactly that. Visit the Fall 2005 Mobilization section of our =
website today, where you will find English- and Spanish-language =
leaflets, including a version that can be easily modified for local use, =
plus an assortment of website banners and buttons for posting on =
websites, blogs, and Indymedia sites.=20


Whether you belong to an anti-war group or are an individual outraged by =
the Bush disaster in Iraq, there's much you can do to help publicize the =
fall mobilization. Download our leaflets, photocopy them, and post them =
in prominent locations in your city or town. Pass them out at the next =
public event you attend. Post our website banners on your website or =
blog, and distribute information about the fall mobilization by email.=20


You can also help build the fall anti-war mobilization by making an =
urgently needed donation to United for Peace and Justice -- either a =
one-time gift or a regular pledge through our new sustainer program.=20


And begin making your travel plans for September now! Join us for the =
massive march of Saturday, September 24, or stay through the weekend. =
There will be an Interfaith Service against the war on Sunday, September =
25, as well as an array of grassroots trainings. On Monday, September =
26, we're organizing a massive grassroots Lobby Day and a mass =
nonviolent civil disobedience action.


United for Peace and Justice welcomes any group that shares our goals =
and wishes to organize a contingent or feeder march in our massive march =
on Saturday, September 24. There will also be a whole host of other =
anti-war activities to participate in throughout the weekend. Visit =
http://www.unitedforpeace.org/fallmobe regularly for updates and more =
details.

Together we can end this immoral and illegal war! See you in September!

I too Maria had a note here stamped to go to the hospice when I heard the
news yesterday.  I would echo the endorsement of <Extraordinary Measures>
and also of his poems.  <Chances are Few> was an important book for me, and
I would urge those unfamiliar with his work to run don't walk to the new
edition Blue Wind Press put out a few years ago, and his precise, and yes
generous Aldon, introduction.  And then on to <Bathers> and last year's
<Dancing on Main Street>.  And what a graceful man and spirit he was.

In other sad news, the poet Estelle Leontief, the author in 1975 of
<Whatever Happens> from Janus Press, died in Manhattan last week at the age
of 97 of a sudden illness.  A memorial service will take place in New York
City in September, according to her daughter Svetlana Alpers.  I will keep
anyone apprised who'd like to be.

Susan - yes, Lorenzo's "graceful spirit" stays with me -
and I'm glad you posted Estelle Leontief's leaving us - she was a longtime
friend of mine, she and Vassily inspired in many ways.  Do post the memorial
information when time.
Every best wish,

I am sad to announce that Philip Hobsbaum died last week at the age of
seventy three.

A poet, critic and teacher, Philip was closely involved with writers in
Cambridge, London, Belfast and Glasgow, where he taught from 1966.

His experience in Belfast was recorded in the collection of poems, +Coming
Out Fighting+, and that of Glasgow in +Women and Animals+.  One chapter of
his major critical work, +A Theory of Communication+, is a revealing
transcript of a session of the London Group in the sixties.

While his major impact was as a mentor of poets -- perhaps one of the finest
of our time -- his own work shouldn't be forgotten.

Fiddy-Cent to Publish Street Lit' Books; Rapper Launches Imprint to Stop “Wanksta” Writers from    Plagiarizing Real G's

By Trina Truthtella, Correspondent-at-Large

(July 5th - New York City) The street literature (street lit) explosion and recent allegations of plagiarism against some of its authors has inspired rapper 50 Cent to enter the publishing game. The rapper reportedly inked a deal with Harper-Collins to helm an imprint called 9 Shots Press.

The imprint seeks to take advantage of the massive resurgence of novels about pimps, strippers, kingpins and other underworld characters currently popular with urban youth. Although many hip hop artists have published their bios with major houses, and the debut novel The Coldest Winter Ever by “raptivist” Sista Souljah is credited widely for renewed interest in fiction about street life, the launch of 9 Shots Press marks the first time an artist has ventured into the literary world at the executive level.

“The publishing industry’s getting just as shady as the music business, and I’m here to clean it up,” said the drug-dealer-turned-multi-platinum rapper at a press conference at the McDonald’s across the street from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. “Just because a nigga’s illiterate doesn’t mean he ain’t got a damned good story to sell. But you got these wankstas out here jacking a real G’s bio, passin’ it off as fiction, and keepin’ all the loot. I’m finna to put an end to that.”

The rapper refers to the recent wave of lawsuits accusing novelists in the genre of plagiarism. In the most notable case, Stagg R. Leigh of Albion Correctional Facility in New York claims to be the true author of the novella "My Pafology" which appears in the novel "Erasure" written by Percival Everett. Publisher’s Weekly praised Erasure as “an over-the-top masterpiece about an African-American writer who ‘overcomes’ his intellectual tendency to ‘write white’ and ends up penning a parody of ghetto fiction that becomes a huge commercial and literary success.” The parody written by Everett’s protagonist under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh is "My Pafology" and appears halfway through the novel.

“Parody my ass. That’s my life story,” said Leigh. “I writ that shit.” If his lawsuit against Everett is successful, 9 Shot Press will move to re-publish "My Pafology" for its inaugural release as a stand-alone title. The author of twelve critically acclaimed books, Everett insists that he penned My "Pafology", and that it’s mere coincidence that his main character’s alter ego and accuser share the same name. “Meanwhile, Erasure didn’t even do that well,” he said from his office at the University of Southern California where he teaches English. “I think it sold one hundred copies at best.”

No stranger to prison, 50 Cent vows that 9 Shot Press will only publish novels by authors whose criminal records could be verified “to ferret out poseurs.” When asked if he also intended to edit the manuscripts he acquired, the rapper quickly responded, “Fuck nah! That’s not keepin’ it real. Besides, I don’t know what the fuck you talking about.”

After pausing to confer with literary agent Stephan Fetchit, the rapper reconsidered. “Well, maybe we’ll do like the music industry does with CDs. Print a few copies with the curses deleted, you know, for the chirren. ‘Cause the more they read the better'n shit.”

“But we’re still keepin’ it gangsta,” he pledges. And that’s precisely what worries some in the African American community. The literary equivalent of gangsta rap, street lit has been attacked by African American leaders within and outside publishing for its gratuitous use of sex and violence, glorification of criminal behavior and perpetuation of stereotypes. Dr. Zora Morrison, the executive director of the Schomburg Center which denied 50 Cent’s request to announce his new venture at the world-renown library said, “[Defenders of street lit] like to say, ‘Hey, at least kids are reading now. They’ll read My Pafology today then read Native Son tomorrow,” said Dr. Morrison who holds a doctorate in African American literature. “Now you try telling a decent parent, ‘Let your twelve-year old watch BET today, and she’ll turn on PBS tomorrow.’ It’s preposterous.”

“There was a time in this country when a Black person could be killed for knowing how to read. Not too long ago in order to get a poorly written novel published you had to be white.” he said. “Sometimes Black folks forget their history, and then the hatin’ begins.” On that point, Morrison couldn’t agree more.

“I’d like to pump nine bullets into him right now,” she said.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per
subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth
notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.



2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.



4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.



5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.



6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
racial slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person
rather than their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a
person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or
criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept HTML-
formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As a matter of convenient style I've adopted a tone of conversation
with the Editorial Board itself, even though I am aware that they have
a stated intention of not responding on list to pieces such as this. I
am not expecting a direct, or even indirect response. I do think there
are enough inquiries into the nature of poetics proper that it is
appropriate for posting to the list.

Some (hopefully) constructive feedback:

poetics@BUFFALO.EDU wrote:

In the interest of being rigorous in my examination, I looked for a
definition of "editorial board" and found:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_board

Which I read closely, and found at least one notable discrepancy. That
particular definition, throughout, gives the impression that the
board, in addition to its meetings and directional steerage, does some
writing of the content. Granted, a listserv is not a newspaper, but
I've been subbed to this list for years and I think (with the
exception of Nick Piombino) I can count on one hand the number of
posts to this list I've seen produced by the board that would qualify
as containing editorial content related to what the core mission is
stated to be. Which is not a problem, by any means, I just wonder why
use the term if the reality doesn't match up when there are other
terms more accurate that could be used. Moderators, for example, or
administrators are both nearer to the actual functions being
performed.

Or, with a different reading of "post" (as in post to the list),
perhaps postmasters!  Sorry, a little levity before embarking on the
beefy bits.

This document has been edited enough times that it now suffers from a
severe case of mutually exclusive contradiction.

It can be parsed down to: The Poetics list is not a forum for the
exchange of poems. Our aim is to support the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,
untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

"received" sticks out like a sore thumb there. How do you receive that
which is no longer supposed to be sent? Maybe received doesn't mean
what I think it does. Maybe support doesn't mean what I think it does,
either.

But that's a nitpick, I'm sharp enough to figure out that what's
really the intent of the above is for the list to be all about a
discussion of Poetry and Poetics, without having to muck around with
those darned poems. Cool, I can appreciate that, I really can.

But interesting conversations about Poetry and Poetics don't happen
until someone starts ranting about having to wipe some messy poem off
their shoe, or, wants to know if there's a better way to plant their
own Poetics in a half a bag of poems someone left in their
apartment. You don't get discussion of Poetry without poems, unless
you provide some prompting. Which an editorial board could certainly
be providing, but, which an administrative/moderative board does not.

It's like putting a bunch of people in a room together and saying,
"ok, be interesting together". Everything goes along fine until you
decide the place would look better without all the weirdos in the
funny hats. After you ask them to leave, or take off their hats, you
discover that everyone in the room was talking about the hats. And you
might even be surprised by this result, until you remembered you were
running the avant garde section of the haberdashery convention.

As long as there's no actual examples of the thing we have gathered
here to protect, honor, worship, love, practice, preach, etc.

This is like Bush-speak.  If the list is going to stay shaped the way
it is, truth in advertising to new subscribers dictates that you
revise this portion. You can't say you're encouraging and supporting
divergent points of view in the very act of discouraging and removing
support for a view that is *central* to this whole enterprise. Poems
are not peripheral to Poetics.

This also has suffered from many versions. You realize you are now
saying that the defining element of the Poetics List is the editorial
function of unsubscribing individuals who are noncomformist.

There really isn't a whole lot of "otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible" work being produced by those
who conform.

But no poems.

This about this for a minute.

I can post to the Poetics list messages related to political activism,
film, art, media, and EVEN so forth. I can post messages about so
forth!

So forth is allowed, but poems are not.

You can post, you know, whatever, as long as it's even remotely
related.

Poems, on the other hand, are apparently not even remotely related to
Poetics.

I'm sorry, you say here that posting of announcements is a core
function, but no mention of this is made at the beginning where the
mission is stated. Maybe it would be clearer and more to the point if
the part about support, inform, and extend went down here, and this
part went at the beginning. Since it is a core function and all.

I mock, but really what I'm saying is what I've been saying all along,
I think this document can no longer withstand piecemeal editing and
band aid application. It needs to be rewritten from scratch and needs
to be much less expansive in its stated aims if it's restrictions are
to stay in place.

Saying it slower, and louder, doesn't work with the hard of hearing or
those who aren't fluent in the language, and it's improper to use the
same technique in this context, as well.  The reason it's improper is
that you're simply restating what you've already said earlier, in no
uncertain terms, in a tone that suggests we're stupid for not getting
it the first time. We're not stupid, you're sending mixed
messages. The reason people keep posting poems to the list despite
being swatted on their virtual noses with repeated admonitions is not
because they're dense, it's because the stated purpose of the list
cannot be assimilated as valid with a prohibition against poems as
part of it. It just doesn't make sense to people, so in weighing the
contradiction, they go with the one that makes sense. Surely, what
they really mean is that they want to support. I mean they said right
in the beginning and so magnificently (no joke, it is a very well
wrought paragraph--it is, in fact, so well done that we actually
believe this is what the list is for).

Imagine walking into an auditorium. There is a huge banner over the
stage that says:

We Support Experimental Poetry

then, on the stage, there's a lectern, with a post-it note on the
angled surface that says:

Not intended for use by poets.

Now imagine there's also another post-it note right on the microphone
that says:

Are you an experimental poet?  If so, DON'T USE THIS!

What do you think will happen if you let 1200 people interested in the
support of experimental poetry mingle around in that auditorium for a
while?

> Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
> discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
> subscribers.

After we told everyone to stop being so conversational, it got really
quiet.  Huh.  I wonder why?

My take on all this is that the editorial board doesn't really have
the resources or inclination to devote much time and effort to an
active involvement with the list. Which I can totally relate to, and
respect. It can take a huge amount of effort to moderate a group with
the potential for stirring stuff up that 1200 people with an interest
in Experimental Poetry has. No doubt. But if we go back to the concept
of "editorial board" for a final analogy, this current direction is
like the editorial board of a newspaper saying, "this job would be
great if it wasn't for all the stories people keep sending in" and the
next one says, "and don't forget the subscribers, boy I could really
get some work done if it wasn't for them" and the third one says,
"hey, if we get rid of the subscribers, those darned advertisers will
go away, too, now that's an elegant solution!"

I would like to see one of two things happen:

1) Rewrite this unwelcoming welcome message to more accurately reflect
   the reality of the dynamic the current board seeks. Because right
   now it's a so riddled with contradiction it's silly.

OR

2) Change the current board to a group more interested in being active
   participants instead of after-the-fact legislators, back-channel
   reprimanders, or figureheads, and then invite poems back in.

I have no intention of unsubscribing, like a few who have tiraded
before me, the signal-to-noise ratio of the posts suits me just fine
as it is, for now.  I like the discussions that do happen, and I like
the calls for submissions, and I sometimes have the time to fire up a
browser and follow a link or two.

But I don't think there's been more high quality critical discussion
of poetics since poems were made to feel unwelcome. I think there's
been less. And I think that's a trend that will continue if poems
remain peripheral to Poetry. It's hard to call a Poetics list alive
when there are more posts about the deaths of poets than about the
births of new poetry.

Dan

Dear Professor Hemmer,

Would you care to have an entry for Landis Everson, long forgotten member of
the Berkeley and San Francisco Renaissances and the Spicer-Duncan-Blaser
circle from the 40s through the 60s, recently rediscovered by myself (see features
in Fulcrum #3, Jacket #26, and the forthcoming Fulcrum #4).  Mr. Everson has
been making a sensation with his new poetry (Poetry, New Republic, Harvard
Review, American Poetry Review, Washington Square, etc) as well as his old, and
recently gave his first poetry reading in over forty years (at the KGB Bar in
NYC). A painting of his was recently displayed in the Poetry and Its Arts
exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Poetry Center, and
the SFPC have located in their archives a recording of Mr. Everson reading his
poetry there in 1956.  While Mr. Everson was not a "beat", he was a
contemporary who was on the scene, and his Berkeley-San Francisco group have been
considered by many to have been both precursors and associates of the Beats.  I
could write you a fine note for him.

Sincerely,
Ben Mazer
Boston University Editorial Institute

As someone relatively new to the list, I can say without reservation that I do not want my e-mail inundated with endless streams of bad poetry. Published poems can be referenced, links cut and pasted, in the course of a discussion of specific poems. I, personally, however, would be in favor of allowing the citation of published poems in whole or part, but not unpublished. I'm fairly sure most of the people who're here to discuss experimental poetry and poetics do not want this list to become a forum for "open mic" publication. Once word got out, the list would really be ruined.

Discussing "received forms" does not refer to workshopping or otherwise discussing poems received from listserv participants, but to interrogating the uses and relevance of traditional, "closed" forms like the sestina or pantoum in the contemporary cultural/political context. So, yes, "recieved" does mean something completely different than what you read it to mean.

It would be nice to have more engaged, rigorous discussions and debates than I've seen so far, but wouldn't it be a better strategy to start one than to try to critique the editorial statement/welcome message (I suppose this applies to me, here, now, equally...maybe I'll give that a try in the morning...)? I'm sure the exchange of original work among a small group of highly talented and intelligent participants must have been exciting and invigorating in its time, and I'm pissed I missed out. However, this list is not that one; this list is far too big to manage that, I think, so I understand the need for setting parameters. But perhaps they could be revised to allow the inclusion of already published works in support of arguments made in expository prose; I see no harm in that.

In the interest of being rigorous in my examination, I looked for a
definition of "editorial board" and found:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial_board

Which I read closely, and found at least one notable discrepancy. That
particular definition, throughout, gives the impression that the
board, in addition to its meetings and directional steerage, does some
writing of the content. Granted, a listserv is not a newspaper, but
I've been subbed to this list for years and I think (with the
exception of Nick Piombino) I can count on one hand the number of
posts to this list I've seen produced by the board that would qualify
as containing editorial content related to what the core mission is
stated to be. Which is not a problem, by any means, I just wonder why
use the term if the reality doesn't match up when there are other
terms more accurate that could be used. Moderators, for example, or
administrators are both nearer to the actual functions being
performed.

Or, with a different reading of "post" (as in post to the list),
perhaps postmasters! Sorry, a little levity before embarking on the

This document has been edited enough times that it now suffers from a
severe case of mutually exclusive contradiction.

It can be parsed down to: The Poetics list is not a forum for the
exchange of poems. Our aim is to support the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,
untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

"received" sticks out like a sore thumb there. How do you receive that
which is no longer supposed to be sent? Maybe received doesn't mean
what I think it does. Maybe support doesn't mean what I think it does,
either.

But that's a nitpick, I'm sharp enough to figure out that what's
really the intent of the above is for the list to be all about a
discussion of Poetry and Poetics, without having to muck around with
those darned poems. Cool, I can appreciate that, I really can.

But interesting conversations about Poetry and Poetics don't happen
until someone starts ranting about having to wipe some messy poem off
their shoe, or, wants to know if there's a better way to plant their
own Poetics in a half a bag of poems someone left in their
apartment. You don't get discussion of Poetry without poems, unless
you provide some prompting. Which an editorial board could certainly
be providing, but, which an administrative/moderative board does not.

It's like putting a bunch of people in a room together and saying,
"ok, be interesting together". Everything goes along fine until you
decide the place would look better without all the weirdos in the
funny hats. After you ask them to leave, or take off their hats, you
discover that everyone in the room was talking about the hats. And you
might even be surprised by this result, until you remembered you were
running the avant garde section of the haberdashery convention.

As long as there's no actual examples of the thing we have gathered
here to protect, honor, worship, love, practice, preach, etc.

This is like Bush-speak. If the list is going to stay shaped the way
it is, truth in advertising to new subscribers dictates that you
revise this portion. You can't say you're encouraging and supporting
divergent points of view in the very act of discouraging and removing
support for a view that is *central* to this whole enterprise. Poems
are not peripheral to Poetics.

This also has suffered from many versions. You realize you are now
saying that the defining element of the Poetics List is the editorial
function of unsubscribing individuals who are noncomformist.

There really isn't a whole lot of "otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible" work being produced by those
who conform.

But no poems.

This about this for a minute.

I can post to the Poetics list messages related to political activism,
film, art, media, and EVEN so forth. I can post messages about so
forth!

So forth is allowed, but poems are not.

You can post, you know, whatever, as long as it's even remotely
related.

Poems, on the other hand, are apparently not even remotely related to
Poetics.

I'm sorry, you say here that posting of announcements is a core
function, but no mention of this is made at the beginning where the
mission is stated. Maybe it would be clearer and more to the point if
the part about support, inform, and extend went down here, and this
part went at the beginning. Since it is a core function and all.

I mock, but really what I'm saying is what I've been saying all along,
I think this document can no longer withstand piecemeal editing and
band aid application. It needs to be rewritten from scratch and needs
to be much less expansive in its stated aims if it's restrictions are
to stay in place.

Saying it slower, and louder, doesn't work with the hard of hearing or
those who aren't fluent in the language, and it's improper to use the
same technique in this context, as well. The reason it's improper is
that you're simply restating what you've already said earlier, in no
uncertain terms, in a tone that suggests we're stupid for not getting
it the first time. We're not stupid, you're sending mixed
messages. The reason people keep posting poems to the list despite
being swatted on their virtual noses with repeated admonitions is not
because they're dense, it's because the stated purpose of the list
cannot be assimilated as valid with a prohibition against poems as
part of it. It just doesn't make sense to people, so in weighing the
contradiction, they go with the one that makes sense. Surely, what
they really mean is that they want to support. I mean they said right
in the beginning and so magnificently (no joke, it is a very well
wrought paragraph--it is, in fact, so well done that we actually
believe this is what the list is for).

Imagine walking into an auditorium. There is a huge banner over the
stage that says:

We Support Experimental Poetry

then, on the stage, there's a lectern, with a post-it note on the
angled surface that says:

Not intended for use by poets.

Now imagine there's also another post-it note right on the microphone
that says:

Are you an experimental poet? If so, DON'T USE THIS!

What do you think will happen if you let 1200 people interested in the
support of experimental poetry mingle around in that auditorium for a
while?

> Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
> discourage the posting of very short messages intended for only a few
> subscribers.

After we told everyone to stop being so conversational, it got really
quiet. Huh. I wonder why?

My take on all this is that the editorial board doesn't really have
the resources or inclination to devote much time and effort to an
active involvement with the list. Which I can totally relate to, and
respect. It can take a huge amount of effort to moderate a group with
the potential for stirring stuff up that 1200 people with an interest
in Experimental Poetry has. No doubt. But if we go back to the concept
of "editorial board" for a final analogy, this current direction is
like the editorial board of a newspaper saying, "this job would be
great if it wasn't for all the stories people keep sending in" and the
next one says, "and don't forget the subscribers, boy I could really
get some work done if it wasn't for them" and the third one says,
"hey, if we get rid of the subscribers, those darned advertisers will
go away, too, now that's an elegant solution!"

I would like to see one of two things happen:

1) Rewrite this unwelcoming welcome message to more accurately reflect
the reality of the dynamic the current board seeks. Because right
now it's a so riddled with contradiction it's silly.

OR

2) Change the current board to a group more interested in being active
participants instead of after-the-fact legislators, back-channel
reprimanders, or figureheads, and then invite poems back in.

I have no intention of unsubscribing, like a few who have tiraded
before me, the signal-to-noise ratio of the posts suits me just fine
as it is, for now. I like the discussions that do happen, and I like
the calls for submissions, and I sometimes have the time to fire up a
browser and follow a link or two.

But I don't think there's been more high quality critical discussion
of poetics since poems were made to feel unwelcome. I think there's
been less. And I think that's a trend that will continue if poems
remain peripheral to Poetry. It's hard to call a Poetics list alive
when there are more posts about the deaths of poets than about the
births of new poetry.

Regards,
Dan





There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

Yeah, his cousin was the *other* Hobsbawn -- Eric.  The marxist historian.

I don't think anything about Philip Hobsbaum's life was particularly
orthodox, in any sense.  He was heavily influenced by Leavis at Cambridge
when Leavis wasn't then respectable.

I ran him through amazon last night, and the books of poems come up "limited
availability" (sod that for a joke), as did +Theory of Communication+.
Nothing even on the second-hand register.

He was a brilliant teacher and a genius at finding and encouraging poets,
but he saw himself as a poet.  Except what he'll be remembered for are the
people he helped -- Heaney for one.

The best book of poems was the Belfast one, +Coming Out Fighting+, and I'll
try and scan and post "The Hard Women" from that anon.

As dave bircumshaw (who even never met him) said, his death leaves a big
gap.  Here at least.  God knows how he figures on your side of the Pond.

I'm too close to this -- I wish someone would take this up and do it
properly.  He won't be forgotten here, but it might be for the wrong things.
Important but partly -- ah, not trivial but not mibee what Philip would have
wished.

His last published book of poems was the Glasgow one, +Women and Animals+.
After that, he was going on to write a sequence called +Lear's Shadow+, but
it never emerged.

He was one of the great ones.

Subject:      Of Lorenzo

I always admired Lorenzo Thomas as a teacher, first seeing/hearing him at
one of Bernadette Mayer's workshops at the Poetry Project in 1972. On that
occasion he was speaking on Chomsky's linguistics. Lorenzo had a way of
teaching to everyone in the room. Though he was the featured lecturer, it
was clear that he understood knowledge to be an essentially communal and
inclusive undertaking.

Many years later, he chaired a wrap-up panel at the Project's symposium on
Revolutionary Poetry. Early in his remarks he said something like "I've
heard some strange shit this weekend." He went on to identify what he found
strange as being based in (a) gradualism, the false notion that decisive
progressive change occurs as some slow automatic by-product of
business-as-usual human affairs and (b) the attitude that all "real" poetry
existed outside (and presumably "above") political organizing and movement
building. Without putting anyone down or championing any particular
aesthetic approach, Lorenzo countered these positions by reading selections
from poems connected with the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, pointing out that
(a) the tangible gains from that period were the result of intentioned,
protracted struggle, beginning long before the coverage of it appeared in
mainstream U.S. newspapers, and (b) that the elegant, forceful, complex
poems he read were not only _real_ but also well-known (and inspirational)
to the participants of the movement.

Certainly what I admired in Lorenzo as a teacher permeates his poems and
essays. I'm glad, though, that I have these and many other
live-and-in-person memories of him. Quite naturally, I think, a part of me
anticipated that there were going to be more occasions of Lorenzo, and
probably that's where the sadness comes in when I think of his passing.

Who does? I'm not entirely convinced that was the motivation behind
going poemless, but even if it was, it seems ill-advised for the
solution to be, "all right then, NO poems at all". But, this is a very
American response, now that I think of it. We like the easy solution
of eliminating the good with the bad in the name of saving us from the
bad. The examples are legion.

I'm curious, how would you define "published"? Does self-publishing
count (Leaves of Grass)? What if you're a highly respected press and
you publish a manuscript of your own through your own press (this
happens a lot)? How about if it's on a blog (the choices are too many
to pick this early)?  How about in the comments of a blog?  What about
posted to a series of listservs reaching a total number of people
greater than the circulation of Poetry (Alan Sondheim, August
Highland, Lanny Quarles, mez, etc)? What constitutes the publishing of
a piece of hypermedia (Jim Andrews)? Do we only talk about things
published by Seagate? What about a poet who declaims all publication
entirely (Jesse Taylor for the 20 years up until this week)?

The welcome message for the Poetics list says that posting to this
list is itself considered by the Editorial Board as a form of
publication.

I can't imagine a criteria for what would legitimately constitute
"published" that wouldn't also exclude at least as much vital work as
it includes.

Particularly now, in this very exciting time of the digital dancing
with literature, on a digitally facilitated list, the kind of work
this list's welcome message says its open to is often (but certainly
not exclusively) precisely the kind of work that is non-publishable,
or apublished, or is in the act of birthing a whole new definition of
what published means.

Even if a workable definition could be found, I think a list that
claims to be open to the impossible in theory, but in practice only
allows the citation of the published is untenable.

I also think the notion of what constitutes "published" today is one
of the most exciting questions in all of literature. I am the type of
person who doesn't really do very well at talking about that
question. I am pretty good, however, at thinking of different ways to
say "well, how about this!?" And I think it's essential to the dialog
to include people of both kinds. Without the former, the discussion
will probably never really happen in any kind of structured way, and
without the latter, the discussion would never have come up in the
first place because there would have been no deviation from the norm
anyway. Lively discussion requires both sides.

Not really. The list was an open mic for a decade and the simple
measures of limiting individuals to 2 posts per day and the entire
list to 50 posts per day was effective at stopping the "if no one
minds, I'll just go ahead and read a dozen more" syndrome.

And I think there is no better way to say you're NOT interested in the
new and emerging, the experimental and the impossible, than to say
you've given up on open readings. Yeah, they can be painfully bad
sometimes. But they are also sometimes brilliant, engaging, and
instructive in the art of being human.

Absolutely this would be better. And this is precisely why I suggested
that the Editorial Board do some of that discussion starting. Because
in an environment where there is this much control coming from the
top, you don't find a lot of people stepping up to test out whether
any given topic is going to end up causing a rule change on them. It
may be of interest to note here that I've had far more back channel
responses of support than total responses on the list. Why would that
be? Because people are more comfortable with it. And if the goal here
is to encourage discussion, that's a failure.

And, actually, I believe have started a more engaged, rigorous
discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome message
be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all kinds
have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, and
the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

Dan, you're making the whole issue of "published" much more complicated than it actually is. No self-published works would be an acceptable rule to me, but so would including self-published works by authors other than oneself. Leaves of Grass, obviously, has been published and republished by many other people than Walt for a long time. I don't believe that it does happen a lot that editors of highly respected presses publish their own books. There are a few exceptions, like Scalapino, who published Crowd and not evening or light through her O Books. If it's a respected press, then include it. If you think it's an amazing work that someone unfortunately had to publish themselves, include it. Rules are guidelines, not absolutes, and people always take liberties. I've definitely seen poems on this list, as it is. Quote from blogs--why not? Quote from online galleries and journals that include electronic, multimedia, and hybrid works. Now just how much is excluded? Any parameters
 will
 necessarily exclude something, but some limits are necessary. I don't think it's as complicated as you find it to be, I don't personally find the issue of what constitututes "published" all that interesting or complex, rather a bit tedious. It really is a matter of common sense. Your splitting hairs with nothing more at stake than whether you can "officially" quote a certain poem on this list that might be excluded from the rules.

But I do agree with you that it seems odd (at best) for a poetics list to institute a complete moratorium on the inclusion of poems...

Maybe the old 50 posts per day limit would work again, though. Does anyone know why this was abandoned originally? I suppose I can imagine that, with around 10000 participants, many people might never get to the head of the line, and that might be more of a problem.

So, yes, how 'bout changing the rules a bit?


Best,

Tod

discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome message
be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all kinds
have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, and
the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

Dan


There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

Tod,

A few quick points:

Even if you were a long-standing member of this list, it would not give=20
you the right to say "I'm fairly sure most of the people who're here to=20
discuss experimental poetry and poetics do not want this list to become=20
a forum for 'open mic' publication." That's not yours to claim. I'm sure =

no harm was intended, but you go on to say "Once word got out, the list=20
would really be ruined." The list has been around for a long time, and I =

consider it currently in a state of ruin. I don't think the poems ever=20
were the threat, and they certainly aren't stifling discussion now.

If we are discussing poetics, isn't a discussion of what constitutes=20
publishing relevant? Of course you aren't required to be interested, but =

I am. One of the wonderful things about free discussions is the way they =

spin off in various directions, yes? Perhaps we could even get an obpoem =

on the subject.

We are in no danger of seeing 50 posts a day on this list. The Editorial =

Board didn't like the direction the list was going, and killed all=20
conversation with a set of new rules and a tightening of the old ones.=20
It was clearly deliberate. I'm not sure how they intend to re-build it,=20
but "limits" at this point seem pretty funny.

Regards,

A poem for Lorenzo Thomas:

DELIBERATE

Here is a guy. Where?
In the corner.
It and he and we are dark.
He doesn't nod, but opens
his marked and watery eyes wider.
I take it as hello, and it is.
His eyes are older than he is.
He's not someone from Philly,
but I understand him in that way
for the moment. People here
would know him. It's the walk, yes.
How he stands, a short guy,
big for his size. How he looks,
a serious and secret comportment.
So he sits; then he's up, then
he's stands and then we're here--
and he says:

<i>But here's The truth:

You have the right to keep your mouth shut

Trust me,

Across the room
A person looking like a crazy version
Of somebody you once knew
Might be our Savior
One who can draw fire
Out of ashes
At least a lover, maybe
The one to take you up a little higher

Or let you down easy.

But don't look this way,

It isn't me </i>

call it speech, and it is--
not as fast I am saying, but not at all slow.

--Tom Devaney

stripped bare like an old woman

he sits in front of the raw spinnet

about two decades ago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in D.C. announced that the
next issue of their magazine was to be a posthumous special issue.  All
contributors had to be dead by publication date.  To everyone's surprise
(except, perhaps, editors of poetry mags), they received an overwhelming number
of submissions and did indeed publish that special issue.

America Supports You: Web Site Will Pay Tribute to Poet Warriors
By Terri Lukach
American Forces Press Service

WASHINGTON, July 6, 2005 – Pfc. Jamie A. Goldstein so touched Kristin
Johnson with his poem about the eagerness of soldiers in training to
fight for their country that she dedicated a Web site to sharing his
poems and the stories of other poet warriors.

"I was just blown away by this wonderful poem," Johnson said. "The
voice he puts to the military is so incredible."

Johnson said Goldstein's poem inspired her to showcase his words and
those of others like him. "The men and women of our armed forces are
bright, intelligent and committed - especially those serving now in
Afghanistan and Iraq," Johnson said. "They are doing something with
their lives and for other people. They are expressing their passion,
their dreams and their commitment to freedom. And I am passionate
about giving them a voice," she said.

Goldstein is attached to the Army's 2nd Battalion, 58th Infantry
Division, and is awaiting deployment to Iraq. His poem describes the
warrior ethos of a brotherhood training for war and eager to fight
for freedom.

Johnson said she spoke with Goldstein's mother. "I talked to her
about the poem," Johnson said, "and was captivated by the need to
capture the history of these men and their families." The "Poet
Warrior Project" started in earnest this month, and Johnson said she
expects the site to be up and running in a few months. Goldstein's
poem will be its inaugural presentation.

Johnson said that while people know of many poets from past wars,
from the nation's earliest days through World War II, not many poets
from recent wars are known. "Yet, these men are in touch with life at
its most fundamental level. To not express that, to lose it, is a
waste," she said.

"This is the history record of a generation, a generation that is
doing something phenomenal. They are fighting a war against
terrorism, and none of us knows what it is like," she continued. "I
want to record their experiences, their feelings, and also that of
their families."

Johnson is a playwright, a journalist, a Web writer, a screenwriter,
the author of three books, and the creator of an Internet site called
"Poems for You" which she launched in 2001. "Writing is my passion,"
she said. "I have always written poetry - for special occasions like
birthdays or weddings. Finally, someone asked, 'Why don't you get
paid for it?'"

She said poetry is a special, personal kind of writing. "There is
something about poetry that is mystical, beautiful," she said. "It
doesn't need to be for publication, but to express feelings. That's
what these soldiers are doing, and in such a beautiful way."

Johnson said she was impressed by the depth, courage and eloquence of
Goldstein's poetry, and hopes to raise awareness of the many
wonderful things American troops are doing that go unreported.

"I'm really thrilled to be able to support our troops in this way,"
she said.

When Eagles Learn to Fly by Pfc. Jamie A. Goldstein 2nd Battalion,
58th Regiment Jan. 14, 2005

High atop a mountain,
The newest look around.
In their hearts they yearn to jump,
But to the nest, they're bound.
They see what's going on abroad,
And it consumes their thoughts.
There's shoes to fill and prey to kill,
And targets to be caught.
They may be mean, they may be angry,
Strong may be their drive.
But all of that means nothing,
'Til these eagles learn to fly.

They sacrifice their blood and sweat,
Earn feathers one-by-one,
And bleed and sweat they will, until
The day of training's done.
And at that time, they then reflect,
On things they all have learned,
And often re-read passages,
From pages that they've turned.
With contempt for their confinement,
They sing verses as they cry,
But that will all soon change
When these eagles learn to fly.

Their blood is hot. Their eyes are cold.
Their hearts know not of fear.
They dream of wreaths of olive leaves,
But still clutch tight their spears.
Collectively they ponder,
The enemies they will try.
They've skills to hone and wings to grow,
But that, they know, takes time.
When the sand has fell completely,
And their wings spread true and wide,
They'll soar across the skyline
And the world shall hear them cry:
"Those who dare burn olive branches,
Those who force their way,
Those who seize what isn't theirs,
And dare refuse to pay,
Those who live by wicked values,
And dare to walk with pride,
Clear your throat and swallow,
For we have learned to fly!"

"Those who dare crusade,
Against the name of what is just,
Those who dare raise arms,
By exploiting others' trust,
And expect a repercussion,
No more violent than a sigh,
Today you shall be proven wrong,
For we have learned to fly!"
"Those who dare condemn us,
For enjoying our free will,

Those who feel our choices,
Make us wrong enough to kill,
Those who dare assault us,
Anywhere at any time -
You've met your final adversary;
For we have learned to fly!"

Utah poet finally handed her laurels

Significant voice: The late May Swenson, obscure in her home state,
will be honored at the Smithsonian gallery
By Kristen Moulton

The Salt Lake Tribune
Salt Lake Tribune

LOGAN - May Swenson may not be known by most folks in the town where
she grew up riding stick horses among the poplars at the bottom of
Old Main Hill, scrubbing floors for her large Mormon family and
writing in her adolescent diary.
   Nor does Utah take much notice of Swenson, who died in Delaware in
1989.
   And yet, her portrait will soon hang in the National Portrait
Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution, a distinction shared by
Brigham Young and Robert Leroy Parker, aka Butch Cassidy, among other
Utahns.
    "It's a real honor for the state as well as for May," says
Suzzanne Bigelow of Salt Lake City, co-author of the 1996 book May
Swenson, A Poet's Life in Photos.
   It also is recognition that Swenson, though largely unknown in her
home town and state, is nonetheless regarded as a significant 20th
century American poet.
   "Within the community of established poets, she is revered," says
Michael Spooner, director of Utah State University Press, which has
published three books about Swenson and is preparing a collection of
essays about her work.
   Spooner, English professor Paul Crumbley and several graduate
students are involved in the May Swenson Project to make the Cache
Valley native better known.
   USU has been been sponsoring an annual poetry contest in her name,
had a symposium last year, established a May Swenson room in the
English Department and plans another in the library now under
construction.
   Swenson's champions also have asked Logan to erect a sign at the
southern entrance to the northern Utah city, denoting it as May
Swenson's birthplace.
   Having her portrait in the National Portrait Gallery can only help
bring Swenson more respect, says Crumbley.
   The 1960 portrait, in pastels and on paper, is by artist Beauford
Delaney, a friend of Swenson's. The National Portrait Gallery bought
it from the poet's literary estate in May.
   "She's obscure. I think that we can change that," says Crumbley.
    Swenson was born in Logan in May 1913, the eldest of 10 children
of Dan Arthur and Margaret Swenson, converts to The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints who immigrated from Sweden to Utah.
   Her father taught woodworking at Utah Agricultural College, which
became Utah State University, and kept fruit trees and a huge garden
on the family's two acres just west of campus. He also was a writer,
and read to his children at the kitchen table at night.
   Swenson's mother was quiet and hard-working and relied on Swenson
to help manage the brood of children who came after her and to keep
house.
   A younger sister, Ruth Eyre of Logan, remembers Swenson
entertaining her young charges with impromptu stories, including one
about how many shoes a centipede would need.
   "She told us that story as she was scrubbing the kitchen floor,"
Eyre recalls.
   After graduating from USU, Swenson worked briefly as a reporter
for the Deseret News in Salt Lake City. At 22, she borrowed $200 from
her dad for a trip to New York City. Thereafter, she made only
occasional visits back to Logan.
   She had hoped to be a newspaper writer, but had to settle for odd
jobs that barely paid the rent on a series of small apartments. At
night, she wrote poetry. After dozens of rejections, she was finally
published in The Saturday Review of Literature, 13 years after she
arrived in New York.
   Though she continued to work at secretarial jobs, Swenson scrimped
so she could take long writing breaks, including several at artists'
colonies, according to her partner of 25 years, Rozanne Knudson.
   By the time Swenson died of a heart attack, brought on by asthma
and high blood pressure at age 76, she had published 11 volumes of
poetry and had been awarded many top cultural honors, such as the
MacArthur Foundation Fellowship worth $380,000. She was a chancellor
for the Academy of American Poets.
   Along the way, Swenson stopped practicing the Mormon religion of
her youth, once explaining that she couldn't have faith in what she
couldn't see. She loved the music, but was not a believer.
   She also was bothered by the discrepancy in the roles of men and
women in the church and all of society, says Knudson, executor of
Swenson's estate and an author herself.
   Swenson remained devoted to her parents - they visited her twice
in Greenwich Village as they traveled to and from Sweden for a Mormon
mission - and she and her siblings were close. She shared her
MacArthur prize money with her brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews.
   Swenson's obscurity, says Spooner at USU, surely has to do with
poetry's small place in American society. "People just don't know
poetry."
   His own university once overlooked opportunities to put the
spotlight on its distinguished graduate.
   Though USU granted Swenson an honorary doctorate in 1987 and
earlier had her teach a summer workshop, the university demolished
the home where she was raised and a former curator, now deceased,
rebuffed an offer for the university to keep some of her papers.
Washington University in St. Louis, instead, has 5,000 of her letters
and working papers.
   Utah's other universities did not invite Swenson for workshops or
readings, although she crisscrossed the country, visiting college
campuses for such occasions.
   Knudson believes there are reasons Utahns, unlike easterners, do
not know Swenson and her work.
   Poetry is about comfort, and Mormons, she says, find comfort in
their own scriptures and inspirational writing rather than in poetry.
Knudson was raised LDS in Virginia and was educated at Brigham Young
University in Provo.
   Though Swenson's siblings adored her, they have been reserved
about publicly trumpeting her poetic genius, says Knudson.
   Not only did Swenson drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes for much
of her life - both proscribed by the LDS Church - she was a lesbian.
Of all the nieces and nephews, not one has May's name, Knudson notes.
   Margaret Woodbury of Provo, who spent her 18th summer with
Swenson, her older sister, in Manhattan, says the family and May had
an understanding.
   "She allowed people to be who they were and we allowed her to be
who she was."
   Crumbley, the USU English professor at the helm of the May Swenson
Project, says Swenson had no use for labels.
   She wasn't a lesbian poet. She wasn't a New York poet. She wasn't
a western poet. Though she wrote often about the Atlantic Ocean,
which she loved, she also wrote about the mountains of the West.
    "She would not be pigeonholed," says Spooner. "She was interested
in all of life."
   One of the most remarkable aspects of Swenson's 900-poem legacy is
its breadth. She wrote about nature and about space travel and
science, often employing humor and irony. Her poetry, though often
poignant, was light rather than dark.
   Ted Kooser, the current U.S. poet laureate, says Swenson had a
strong influence on him as a young poet.
   "It seemed to me she could do anything, could write well in any
form, in any mood, and the poems were not only virtuoso performances
but rich with life and feeling," he wrote in an e-mail to The Salt
Lake Tribune.
   Wendy Wick Reaves, curator of prints and drawings at the National
Portrait Gallery in Washington, says the gallery was thrilled to buy
the 18-by-24-inch portrait of Swenson.
   The museum has been closed for renovation since early 2000 and
won't reopen until July 4, 2006. The reopening exhibits are already
scheduled, so Swenson's portrait will have to be displayed later.
   Swenson will be the 21st Utahn in the gallery, either as a
portrait subject or artist.
   "She isn't as well-known as Marianne Moore or Elizabeth Bishop,
but she really does rank with them in terms of 20th century poetry,"
says Reaves. "She was really very, very influential."

On the contrary, Jonathan, I have EVERY right to express my opinion, with the
understanding that it's merely that: my one opinion. Period. It may be wrong,
it may be in the minority, but I have never and I will never shy away
from expressing my opinion. If I'm wrong in my assumption you cite
below, then let me know when the slam competition begins so I can
unsubscribe.

Of course those interested should discuss what constitutes "publishing"
if they like--I never said I thought that shouldn't be allowed. I don't think
it's a  debate that's relevant, however, to setting down some practical
guidelines that certainly don't have to be immutable or without
exception, and that may help resolve the rather bizarre state of (at least officially) having no poems allowed in a discussion of poetry and poetics.

I think it's a shame that some people feel the list is currently in a
state of ruin. Something really should be done to counter that. What can
we do? Anybody?

discuss experimental poetry and poetics do not want this list to become
a forum for 'open mic' publication." That's not yours to claim. I'm sure
no harm was intended, but you go on to say "Once word got out, the list
would really be ruined." The list has been around for a long time, and I
consider it currently in a state of ruin. I don't think the poems ever
were the threat, and they certainly aren't stifling discussion now.

If we are discussing poetics, isn't a discussion of what constitutes
publishing relevant? Of course you aren't required to be interested, but
I am. One of the wonderful things about free discussions is the way they
spin off in various directions, yes? Perhaps we could even get an obpoem
on the subject.

We are in no danger of seeing 50 posts a day on this list. The Editorial
Board didn't like the direction the list was going, and killed all
conversation with a set of new rules and a tightening of the old ones.
It was clearly deliberate. I'm not sure how they intend to re-build it,
but "limits" at this point seem pretty funny.

No self-published works would be an acceptable rule to me, but so would including self-published works by authors other than oneself. Leaves of Grass, obviously, has been published and republished by many other people than Walt for a long time. I don't believe that it does happen a lot that editors of highly respected presses publish their own books. There are a few exceptions, like Scalapino, who published Crowd and not evening or light through her O Books. If it's a respected press, then include it. If you think it's an amazing work that someone unfortunately had to publish themselves, include it. Rules are guidelines, not absolutes, and people always take liberties. I've definitely seen poems on this list, as it is. Quote from blogs--why not? Quote from online galleries and journals that include electronic, multimedia, and hybrid works. Now just how much is excluded? Any parameter

I don't think it's as complicated as you find it to be, I don't personally find the issue of what constitututes "published" all that interesting or complex, rather a bit tedious. It really is a matter of common sense. Your splitting hairs with nothing more at stake than whether you can "officially" quote a certain poem on this list that might be excluded from the rules.

But what you offered was not your opinion. It was, as you correctly
called it a moment later, an assumption, one that lead you to speak for
the list at large. By all means, express your opinion. But surely you
understand that is different from claiming to express the opinion of
"most of the list."

The last time this was debated (and it has been debated often and
heavily), there was about a 50%-50% split among the vocal members as to
whether or not the posting of poems should be permitted. Of course,
neither you nor I have any idea what most of the list readers think. If
you are unwilling to be on a list with those who are interested in
unpublished poetry, on the grounds that we are all conspiring to cause a
"slam competition," that is of course your perogative. I assure you I'm
not unwilling to share space with you. Personally, I think hyperbole is
pretty groovy.

Fair enough. It's nice when a conversation spins into something it was
not, originally, though. I'm going to skip the implied question of "what
should be these practical guidelines?" for the reasons I outlined below.

The bottom line on this: the Editorial Board does not appear to be at
all swayed or interested by what people think should be done to the
list. That is my analysis, and it could be inaccurate. However, since it
seems to be the case, I don't see the point in debating or suggesting. I
assume they have a plan for rebuilding the list. If so, we wil likely
see its results eventually. If not, oh well. I don't see any indication
that our input is solicited.

Thas a syllaku, yuh dope!

Didn't know Jesse had taken his vendetta against the
use of "ku" to suggest haikuic tonalities to this high
court, for I don't visit it much.  Apparently nobody
came to my defense!  Woe.

Didn't see the following.  It doesn't defend my
"mathemaku" and "crytographiku," but defends Scott's

The following was commissioned by David Buuck, editor and publisher of
the journal Tripwire.  I figured it'd make a suitable contribution to
the tributes and other remarks here.

The Cartesian Funk on the Recent Work of Lorenzo Thomas, Poet.



Writing poems involves that desperate attempt to pass through
sophistication into wisdom.

--Lorenzo Thomas, introduction to Chances Are Few: Expanded Second
Edition, 2003



In French philosophers Gilles Deleuze & Félix Guattari's third of A
Thousand Plateaus, a lobster becomes an exemplar of and persona for the
history of philosophy.  Simultaneously, it stands for geo-political
"globalization" - neo-colonialism's intrinsic foil.  The lobster's flesh
secretes its own shell - the virtual as such becomes actual.  Unless you
also read the seemingly a-Deleuzian philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, you
will read the lobster as a metaphor rather than a constituent of this
veritable "globe."  Levinas' ethical system is hinged on the infrequent
but fundamental observation that Descartes' "discovery" of modern
scientific reason is not taken at liberty.  That is, 'I think, therefore
I am' ('I am thinking, therefore I am being') can only announce the
principle of universal doubt and its corollary mind-body split by fiat.
For Descartes, the thought of infinity perforce "takes place" within us
- there is no will to doubt in Descartes.  History is the infinite
encasing of time itself;  it is only a metaphor for the indeterminacy -
not a Marxian "anarchy of exchange" - modern and contemporary USAmerican
poetics have inherited as the "promise of infinite determination"
(Deleuze, Kant's Critical Philosophy).  They used to call it
"ambiguity," and its types.  For one, you have the weird nostalgia of
the Poundian epic.  But another way the USAmerican poem includes history
is via (dare we say) organic form, as the lobster secretes its shell.
But it is another thing entirely (osmosis maybe, but not, in Guattari's
word, "chaosmosis") when



...the drama is wholly subjective

stone knowing the form which the carver imparts it

the stone knows the form  (The Cantos 450)



Ethical self-evidence is metaphysical fascism.  PART ONE:  They eat them
for dinner.

            If all this supposedly heady quipping seems to you out of
place in a review essay on Lorenzo Thomas' recent work, I won't
apologize.  There are few other ways to return the generosity of a poem
like "Dangerous Doubts."



The mind invents its own inadequacies

But not the power to erase illusion

That schemes and wholesome dreams

Can become actual despite the truth

That thoughts invest themselves in flesh

And direct motion  (Dancing on Main Street 119)



This from the man who, in the 2003 "Introduction" to the expanded
edition of his first major collection Chances Are Few, wrote:



This modern world--what T.S. Eliot taught us to call "our
civilization"--began in 1492 with a series of cultural collisions that
continue to reverberate.  We've had five hundred grim years of
progress:  a kaleidoscope of ancient fears and hatreds, bright visions
and hopeful dreams, justifiable suspicions and ordinary greed,
constantly recycled as history becomes everyday life and vice versa.  (vii)



Justifiable suspicions are not the unique providence of the benignly
reasonable subject whose danger begins when the thought (unthinkable) of
the infinite takes place within her / him.  But what
"civilization"--what "our"--seeps through the many salvos from Vietnam,
the Civil Rights Movement (see also Thomas' epic The Bathers), and the
mundane "career" vicissitudes of a Panamanian in Texas' "liquid city"?



That you have 30,000 shots at immortality

But only one you dare not miss at being rich

Or at least escape the nag of destitution (Dancing on Main Street 119)



A vetran of the latter New York School scene (see The Angel Hair
Anthology), Thomas' lists are several times less "sophisticated" than a
Ted Berrigan.  As the listing continues, I'm mostly taken with the
bravery this approach demonstrates--especially in face of what used to
be known as "subject matter."  Last I saw such bravery it was heroism
(Whitman, Sandburg, Baraka).  Thomas' piece on the Umbra Workshop school
(Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric Modernism and Twentieth-Century
American Poetry 118-144) is informative here.



That maybe exercise shows on TV

Are really harmful

That sound bodies just

Amplify our empty minds



That platitudes contain a grain of wisdom



And fortune's a rush hour train that doesn't wait



The limits of human invention = organic form.  So it allows these things
to replace eternity.  What else?



To really live means needing other people

That whatever that means love

Could conquer hate



Love and hate are beside the point when the real escapes the "means."
It's not just that is an elegy, but it's steeped in the anticipation of
the elegy's raison d'être in this, "our civilization."

USA TODAY:  the migrating quagmire / '5 Million Tsunami Survivors Lack
Food & Water' / Rumsfeld to Go / He Can'na Make It Cohere.  PART TWO:
He Can'na.

Thomas is that rare critic / literary historian who takes the evaluative
function of criticism seriously, not as self-evident, but as a question
of literary production (as opposed to disinterested reflection).  There
is a singular lack of hubris in his project - reading his work is to
witness the self-conscious entrance of one man's labor into historical,
indeed "interesting times."

I'll just excerpt one short passage from Extraordinary Measures, Thomas'
new scholarly tome, by way of commenting on his economy in that
expository mode, but moreso his thoroughgoing responsibility to critical
self-reflection within the construction of historical categories /
narratives.  I have been an avid reader of Amiri Baraka's work for many
years and have never found a truer summation of his historical
centrality than this one:



Many are not always convinced by his notion of science.  For good and
bad reasons.  Baraka, as critic Ezekiel Mphalele (otherwise one of our
most alert readers) has consistently failed to understand, is best as a
poet of intense personal reflection, which is exactly why he always
appears to us in the prophet's sackcloth of social activism.  Literally,
he does not have time to be himself.  But were he given the time, who
(as he himself eloquently ponders in his poems) would that self be?  In
this way he speaks to us in our lostness, striving, and misery, and we
are habituated now to the eager anticipation of his own subsequent
interpretations of each current guise.  For all his complexity, however,
Baraka's work reveals a fundamental consistency.  (159)



The lobster's gotten loose.  Thomas, as central (if not as high-profile)
to the history of "Afro-Centric Modernism" as Baraka, ranges his account
from Fenton Johnson to Harryette Mullen, with the Umbra school sharing
elbow room with Baraka's return to Newark in 1966.  Ishmael Reed and
Thomas are seen making a pilgrimage there to indulge in Newark's acidic
nightlife, all of a Christmas Eve.  Thomas gives testimony so much due,
perfectly integrating memoir and history, with critical treatment.  As
such, he makes his critique possible and his deceptively simple
apostrophic address (in Dancing on Main Street) plausible.  And I get
wise to it, this civilized funk.  It wriggles out between the two books
as a frontier defines itself by the here and there it must touch.  This
makes him a prototypical but atypically better critic in the now sadly
clogged cultural studies vein.

            Another way of saying this is to say that Thomas has a
penchant for developing true questions out of his material--history,
experience, language.  He never takes the validity of those questions
for granted.  Instead, he works them like a George Clinton bassline,
over and over until they prove their mettle, which saves him from
sycophancy and solipsism.  The conditions of the real are not far from
the conditions of the true--and that's what lends the whole adventure
its palpable suspense.  From Dancing on Main Street, "Thinking in Words"
is a good example to these ears.

            There is an account of what seems to be a gathering of
French philosophers,



Thinking in strong but well-scrubbed Germanic

Words adopted by romantic conversation

Knowledge of their natural parents lost

To counterfeit a long melodious decay

We might call Art or serious concern  (87)



Then the mingling scents of a bar-b-qued beef sandwich and "piss"--and a
litany of synaesthetic linguistic triggers befalls our narrator, an
alienated young ethicist on a street corner (perhaps my own beloved
Mission District):  "Freedom fighter, weirdo, wino..."



So the distinction can be made

Between bar-b-qued felons

And napalmed bystanders

We need to be thinking in words

To tell our hearts and minds

Which way to flutter  (88)



PART THREE:  He flutta' (or, synethsis) / Shell-shock / I am thinking,
therefore I am being.

Hi Leslie

How are you doing? Are you at Bard College again this
summer? Call me if you would like to come down to
Beacon again (845-831-3397).

I'm writing to you about O Books. I wonder if you
would like to see the manuscript of my second novel
"The Secret Room: A String Quartet."

The novel is actually written in musical lines--each
of 4 characters taking the role of one of the
instruments in a string quartet. Each character has a
different font, but there also handwritten musical
bars and clefs to allow the eye to follow more easily.
The reader will perhaps read a single instrument
(character) or could try to read simultaneously. There
are shorter sections of the novel written in prose
paragraphs.

The four characters (Sonia, a violinist; Jaffar, a
yoga teacher; Jody, a stay at home mom; and Pratap, an
office worker) do not merely interact physically, but
also in history, sometimes metaphorically (Jody and
Sonia never meet--but Jody listens to a concern of
Sonia's on the radio--a concert Pratap is at).

Anyhow, it is a little conceptually experimental--to
my mind strictly a novel, strictly prose--but hard to
get market-driven publishers to think like this. Hence
my thinking of approaching small presses--

If you like I can send the full manuscript to you (it
is around 215 pages).

Hope you are well,

Kazim Ali

is a good example to these ears.

            There is an account of what seems to be a gathering of
French philosophers,



Thinking in strong but well-scrubbed Germanic

Words adopted by romantic conversation

Knowledge of their natural parents lost

To counterfeit a long melodious decay

We might call Art or serious concern  (87)



Then the mingling scents of a bar-b-qued beef sandwich and "piss"--and a
litany of synaesthetic linguistic triggers befalls our narrator, an
alienated young ethicist on a street corner (perhaps my own beloved
Mission District):  "Freedom fighter, weirdo, wino..."



So the distinction can be made

Between bar-b-qued felons

And napalmed bystanders

We need to be thinking in words

To tell our hearts and minds

Which way to flutter  (88)

Tod, et alles,

The rules against: "...this is the most unkindest cut of all..." came =
after the fact of the  creative writing.

Rules are made for following, unless: ignoring, destroying, abhorring =
them harms no one but yourself, in which case, screw the rules!

In my opinion, more often than we perhaps care to recognize, creative =
souls run rough-shod over rules, ignoring them right and left no matter =
who posted the edict.  And they do that not out of disrespect for rules =
but rather because they find rules restrict the creative process they =
are driven to practice, and their drive to create is greater than their =
drive to conform.

I suspect if one were to post on POETICS a poem that broke new ground in =
either presentation, or form or metrical stanzaic pattern, or if one =
wrote a poem that excited even the nearly dead intellects such as I by =
either its wit or its originality, no one of the moderators, editors, =
authorities on the list would dare excommunicate the creator of such =
works.=20

Here though is the essence of the list to date:

Po'ms
tomes

silence
brilliance

xfe
fex
so paints the saints

But, rules aside,  perhaps the real problem with the list is not the =
edict banning poetry; rather it is the failure of the moderators/editors =
on the list to realize that there can be no discussion of poetics and =
poetry without poetry itself...how sad. =20

  Dan, you're making the whole issue of "published" much more =
complicated than it actually is. No self-published works would be an =
acceptable rule to me, but so would including self-published works by =
authors other than oneself. Leaves of Grass, obviously, has been =
published and republished by many other people than Walt for a long =
time. I don't believe that it does happen a lot that editors of highly =
respected presses publish their own books. There are a few exceptions, =
like Scalapino, who published Crowd and not evening or light through her =
O Books. If it's a respected press, then include it. If you think it's =
an amazing work that someone unfortunately had to publish themselves, =
include it. Rules are guidelines, not absolutes, and people always take =
liberties. I've definitely seen poems on this list, as it is. Quote from =
blogs--why not? Quote from online galleries and journals that include =
electronic, multimedia, and hybrid works. Now just how much is excluded? =
Any parameters
   will
   necessarily exclude something, but some limits are necessary. I don't =
think it's as complicated as you find it to be, I don't personally find =
the issue of what constitututes "published" all that interesting or =
complex, rather a bit tedious. It really is a matter of common sense. =
Your splitting hairs with nothing more at stake than whether you can =
"officially" quote a certain poem on this list that might be excluded =
from the rules.

  But I do agree with you that it seems odd (at best) for a poetics list =
to institute a complete moratorium on the inclusion of poems...

  Maybe the old 50 posts per day limit would work again, though. Does =
anyone know why this was abandoned originally? I suppose I can imagine =
that, with around 10000 participants, many people might never get to the =
head of the line, and that might be more of a problem.

  So, yes, how 'bout changing the rules a bit?


  Best,

  Tod

  Who does? I'm not entirely convinced that was the motivation behind
  going poemless, but even if it was, it seems ill-advised for the
  solution to be, "all right then, NO poems at all". But, this is a very
  American response, now that I think of it. We like the easy solution
  of eliminating the good with the bad in the name of saving us from the
  bad. The examples are legion.

  I'm curious, how would you define "published"? Does self-publishing
  count (Leaves of Grass)? What if you're a highly respected press and
  you publish a manuscript of your own through your own press (this
  happens a lot)? How about if it's on a blog (the choices are too many
  to pick this early)? How about in the comments of a blog? What about
  posted to a series of listservs reaching a total number of people
  greater than the circulation of Poetry (Alan Sondheim, August
  Highland, Lanny Quarles, mez, etc)? What constitutes the publishing of
  a piece of hypermedia (Jim Andrews)? Do we only talk about things
  published by Seagate? What about a poet who declaims all publication
  entirely (Jesse Taylor for the 20 years up until this week)?

  The welcome message for the Poetics list says that posting to this
  list is itself considered by the Editorial Board as a form of
  publication.

  I can't imagine a criteria for what would legitimately constitute
  "published" that wouldn't also exclude at least as much vital work as
  it includes.

  Particularly now, in this very exciting time of the digital dancing
  with literature, on a digitally facilitated list, the kind of work
  this list's welcome message says its open to is often (but certainly
  not exclusively) precisely the kind of work that is non-publishable,
  or apublished, or is in the act of birthing a whole new definition of
  what published means.

  Even if a workable definition could be found, I think a list that
  claims to be open to the impossible in theory, but in practice only
  allows the citation of the published is untenable.

  I also think the notion of what constitutes "published" today is one
  of the most exciting questions in all of literature. I am the type of
  person who doesn't really do very well at talking about that
  question. I am pretty good, however, at thinking of different ways to
  say "well, how about this!?" And I think it's essential to the dialog
  to include people of both kinds. Without the former, the discussion
  will probably never really happen in any kind of structured way, and
  without the latter, the discussion would never have come up in the
  first place because there would have been no deviation from the norm
  anyway. Lively discussion requires both sides.

  Not really. The list was an open mic for a decade and the simple
  measures of limiting individuals to 2 posts per day and the entire
  list to 50 posts per day was effective at stopping the "if no one
  minds, I'll just go ahead and read a dozen more" syndrome.

  And I think there is no better way to say you're NOT interested in the
  new and emerging, the experimental and the impossible, than to say
  you've given up on open readings. Yeah, they can be painfully bad
  sometimes. But they are also sometimes brilliant, engaging, and
  instructive in the art of being human.

  Absolutely this would be better. And this is precisely why I suggested
  that the Editorial Board do some of that discussion starting. Because
  in an environment where there is this much control coming from the
  top, you don't find a lot of people stepping up to test out whether
  any given topic is going to end up causing a rule change on them. It
  may be of interest to note here that I've had far more back channel
  responses of support than total responses on the list. Why would that
  be? Because people are more comfortable with it. And if the goal here
  is to encourage discussion, that's a failure.

  And, actually, I believe have started a more engaged, rigorous
  discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

  I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
  great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome message
  be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
  situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
  the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
  as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
  publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
  so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
  don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
  underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

  I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
  other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all kinds
  have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
  think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, and
  the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

  I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

  Dan


  There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

or simply a failure of the subscribers... in the context of some discussion,
i didn't think a poem or a creative response was disallowed...

if their attempts to maintain the list kill it, then they will learn
something... if that's what will happen... if it goes on in a new direction,
then that's what will happen...

it seems like there are plenty of splinter groups out there to accommodate
folks, which is one drawback to this medium...

Poeticsists --

long time no e.  Seeing hints of brouhaha about
publishing / not publishing on linst / not on list,
inclines me to publish on list.  Hence this.
But with poetics notation.

For a long time occasionally, & lately more freaquently,
I've employed an 8-line form which I dub the
"boomerang poem" (due to the return of the 1st line
as the final line).  The form's antecedent is found
in classical Chinese poetry.  I've only seen a few
examples in translation, but when I worked in the
East Asiatic Library at UC Berkeley (about 25 years
ago), wandering the stacks, I found at least one
volume that seemed to be entirely in boomerang form,
and sometimes noted other poems occasionally so.

Here's an example of what I'm doing with this
in English.  In this case (and usually, and
classically in Chinese, rhyme-scheme is:
AB AB BA BA.

[ The Basho reference: he'd stayed at an inn
where two prostitutes, who were on a pilgrimage,
were in a nearby room and he heard their conversation
through the wall.  He jotted a haiku saying that that
night, both the moon and clover slept under the same
roof (or something like that). ]

cheers,
david

/ / /

"this is Friday" (boomerang poem)

It's 9 a.m.  who am I?  this is Friday
it seems the rain has ceased  the fruitflies hover
is this a what-day or is it a why-day?
I read Basho's remark on moon & clover
it seemed conceited   anyway   the lover
of landscapes walks an endless world   but my day
has dawned  with obligations still to cover
it's 9 a.m.  who am I?  this is Friday

calls to mind the story of Ni Zan (Ni Tsan in older

China, whose impromptu bamboo (painted on a friend's wall,

"Yes," said Ni, "but to achieve a complete lack of

Through its sectional appearances Improvisations has consistently =
offered its readers a dizzying flight across textual geographies and =
social aporia. Now we can encounter and engage its full monumentality as =
a vast text whose verbal excess and vertiginous typographic variations =
mark a stunning moment in the history of gestural poetics. It is a true =
comment on what it is to not only live modernity but to actively engage =
it.

- Steve McCaffery

Improvisations will take its place in the modernist, postmodernist and =
alternative pantheon of masterpieces. Vernon Frazer presents us with a =
'new physics' of poetic structure. It is not contingent upon any =
preconceptions of what poetry 'has been' or 'should be'. Its roots are =
far reaching and ubiquitously move rhizomically beneath the surface of =
the poetic page. It is there that Improvisations manifests its =
multi-dimensional, polyphonic, nonlocal music-of-the-spheres resonances, =
echoing down cerebral corridors and unfolding to the reader a =
synergistically limitless semantically rich poetic realm.=20

LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY
and the LIBRARY FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES PRESENT

=93ALOUD at Central Library=94
Lectures, Readings, Performances & Discussions

July 12, Tuesday, 7 PM
Lewis MacAdams
=93The River, Book Three=94

World premiere of MacAdams=92 The River, Book Three, a continuation of =
his
mini-epic about his life and work among the trash bags and red-wing
blackbirds of the much-maligned Los Angeles River.

About Lewis MacAdams:
Poet, activist, journalist Lewis MacAdams is the author of a dozen books
and tapes of poetry, and his poems have appeared in many anthologies
over
the last twenty-five years.

=A0As a journalist, in the early 80=92s, he was the American =
correspondent
for
the popular French magazine Actuel. From 1980 to 1982, he was the editor
of
WET, =93the Magazine of Gourmet Bathing and Beyond,=94 a =
Los-Angeles-based,
internationally-circulated bi-monthly of the avant-garde. Since the
mid-80=92s he has been a contributing editor of the L.A. Weekly. He =
writes
regularly on culture and ecology for Rolling Stone, the L.A. Weekly,
Men=92s
Journal, L.A. Times, and Los Angeles Magazine. His book, Birth of the
Cool:
Beat, Bebop and the American Avant Garde was published in 2001. He is
currently writing a biography of Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner,
which
will be published in 2006.

=A0In 1985, he founded Friends of The Los Angeles River, a =9340 year =
art
work=94
to bring the Los Angeles River back to life. In the years since, FoLAR
has
become the River=92s most important and influential advocate. Two of its
current major goals are to create a Los Angeles River Conservancy to
oversee restoration of the river, and a River Watch program to improve
the
River=92s water quality and target polluters. In 1991, MacAdams received
the
San Fernando Valley Audubon Society=92s annual Conservation Award.

=A0A new collection of poems, The River: Books One, Two & Three,
(published
by Blue Press) takes the Los Angeles River as its metaphor, weaving the
story and song of the poet, activist and journalist as these three roles
form the confluence which is the man.  Copies of the book will be
available
at the reading.

Perhaps, one, a question:

Is this site sanctioned by ny of the
branches of the armed forces (say, marines),
which are officially linked to it?

Is there any connecton between this
and Gioia's pet project?

You're right, Irving--should be SYLLOKU.  Dunno how I
wrote SYLLAKU--except that I've been recently pushing
a new term of mine, the "syllabreak," for fragmenting
a word in the middle of a syllable, something I'm
claiming Cummings pioneered in, and possibly invented.

Yeah, I just got my copy of the Big Birthday Book (for
Richard Kostelanetz) and much liked your entry.  Lots
of other good things in it, too.

Ooops, it's getting windy here.  Gotta go hide.

It's a pretty "wack" site, at least the originating
one.  The author charges for creating poetry for
occasions, mostly weddings--read the effusive
testimonials (unless you have great faith in this
country's literacy).

Now, this may border on being border-line, but who
wouldn't mind an exquisite piece of language-y-ish
writing to mark an occasion?   I am not entirely not
serious:  does being "commissioned" as it were negate
a poem's "authenticity" (again, this for lack of a
better word, or better yet, simple put it
sous-rature)?*  And there is no doubt that those of us
who find rituals necessary, but the old vows
troublesome look for words to replace them.




*(I fell upon the word commissioned since it is part
of one my favorite phrases of Wordsworth's:
"commissioned spirits".)

Hey Chris

You rhymed Giddy with City--Creeley wd have gotten a kick from that.

Maybe you've hit on something--the aloneness expressed in his poems allowed
a social freedom in his life. Who knows what anyone experiences, on the
other hand? But of course we love him bec he is better able to say than
most. How cd anyone be so "happily" & "sadly" & intellectually engaged
simultaneously or nearly simultaneously? That was his genius, as well as his
intuitive sense of sound--you know the sounds are right but can't dissect
them as you can with say Yeats.

I guess people--sometimes incl me--think poets are really writing abt
themselves, novelists abt characters or people they know.Of course much more
to say abt that & unsavoriness. (It was interesting to me that Eliot
Weinberger in his wonderful anthology American Poetry since 1950 included
Anne Sexton among the usual suspects--maybe bec she made the unsavory
surreal in her wild Jesus poems.)

Great to have this exchange with you--& I think we both have poems for
Creeley in the forthcoming Wandering Hermit Review...? Anyway, I'm a fan.

Hi & bye,
Ruth

Alex,

Yep, "creative souls" like to "run rough-shod over
rules", as you say, but ONE rule that's pretty good to
stick to is something Shakespeare had Falstaff say:
"the better part of valor is discretion".  The late
Buffalo poet/professor/musician John (Jack) Clarke
once pointed out in class that in addition to the
admonition to be discreet, this could be heard as a
"space" statement: you always need to know the
DISCRETE point in space where you are and act
accordingly.

So where were you on the evening of June 17, 2005,
sir?  I'll tell you--you were on the Poetics Board
telling Alan Sondheim to do traditionally noble
humanist things in his writing--"find me the essence
of the people in a spot where you are...I need to know
that you can and do see, feel, hear, taste and touch
the human element of the locals you encounter...From
what I see and feel of your reports, you remain
disassociated...Get the fuck out there and mingle,
make some painful contacts...feed the pigeons and
embrace the people who sit beside you..."

Can you understand how this sounds on a list that was
created to serve the experimental and
"impossible"--even to people who don't like the work
and play of Alan Sondheim, and God knows there's a lot
of dissension about that fellow.  Please, please, be
HUMAN Alan, you're saying, as if it's so clear what it
is to be a responsive human in this raging bleeping
beeping world!

So I'd say know where you are on this Board, it's
worth it no matter how much this place is dying...if
you meditate about all this and still feel you must
speak boldly for traditional concepts of "human
expression" then I think you should speak with a
"loyal oppositionist" tone that acknowledges that you
are speaking against the grain but there is something
you want to quietly argue...

You see, such "indescretion" (as also, your telling
Charles Bernestein so glibly in early May that surely
he knows he should be "debunking" Adorno's poetry
after Auschwitz statement as "utter nonsense") only
feeds the intense fear/paranoia of some people long
involved with this list that the wrong people are
crashing the party and ruining the discourse and
conducting their dopey open mic...

Peace to you, Alex, and to all.






travels, hell creeps like me are all over Poetics.
 Find for me the lady who still wears her wedding gown
from the day she
was left standing on the church steps.  Let me hear
her laughter from
the recognition of her good fortune at having shed
herself of the twit.

Get your ass off the back end of the camera and sit on
the fucking
bench; then,
share their experiences with us, if they'll let you in
on them.

Other wise...hurry the fuck home and end this travel
charade.
Alex

Comes a cleansin
Like graffic typos
Of sk8ers turn to negros
Castin a spell on
Check points
Over flows
Thousands
Set solid bout this city
I will you bring you
Urban cantos
Echoed by rockabillies
Woht will strike your
Silly wallz crumbling down
On bus rides
To positive
logic
Like math tricks
Squared to the
Forgotten
losses
Of philistines
In creepers
Getting searched on the streets of paris
The fadeeya so high
Like the purest called katrachos
It’s a crime
So I send my bruhs
Duas
With the eloquence of
Fatima
Slammin words like a flower
Of sound bombs
On Sharon
Aerial assaults
over free wireless
Greater victories of daemons
To clash with
Evil dreams
Dishin out the cleansin
Of loans burning
with the vision of
Jinns
who breath payback and paranoia
Fearing the noheh
Who pound chests
Hollerin in the hiz
Songs of
War like rocks on rings
Breathin secrets in palms
A clarity
like swords by bruhs
Clutchin the clay
In mag pockets

Iraqi Insurgency Proves A Life Saver:
Pentagon Study Reveals Many Thousands More Would Have Died If Iraq Forces Had

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

This is the way it always goes, isn't it -- the revolutionaries discover that
the only way to maintain the revolution is to become dictatorial and
super-controlling about who can say what, when, and where. Open
discourse is the first victim, as it has been here. The notion that there
are "the wrong people" is anathema to the very notion of the principles
of a revolution that glories in extreme diversity -- and yet, and yet, there
you go, in defense of the totalitarian view, belaboring "the wrong
people" who talk about what you think are the wrong things in the wrong
way. You want to silence them and enable what you no doubt think of as
"the right people" -- and how different is that from any other totalitarian
dictator who only wants to hear what he wants to hear, and who refuses
to hear anything else?

Subject:      A Contrast to Kimmelman
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Robert Hass has an engaging poem in the New Yorker (June 27, p.97) called
THE PROBLEM OF DESCRIBING TREES. The poem has a fascinating complication
and pleasure to to it, and it shares some of Kimmelman's concerns, but the
first two lines struck me as offering a sharp contrast to Kimmelman.  Hass
opens

                The aspen glitters in the wind.
                And that delights us.

I take it that the trembling motions of the aspen is in the background
and the word "delights" is the foreground.

It's the other way around with Kimmelman, motion is to the foreground.
Words that name inner feelings tend to be avoided completely, or if they
appear at all, they belong to a process or repetition, or of resistance
outside of the reader.

Consider the word "undaunted" in a poem SOL LEWITT'S  Double Pyramid
(Whitney Museum Restaurant 12.23.00)


                How incredibly
                lucky art is, its

                shining like the sun,
                undaunted--and we,
                too, from below the
                summit, in our odd
                ways make it come true.

In JANE AND RYAN AT THE SHORE, motion itself evokes emotion.

                Legs curl under
                in the darkened

                sand. The waves run
                easily up

                the beach. Dolphin
                fins pace the sea

                beyond. Water has
                found us all.

In different ways,  Kimmelman and Hass are both relevant to Angus
Fletcher's "A NEW THEORY FOR AMERICAN POETRY, Democracy, the Environment
and the Future of the Imagination."

  Alex,

  Yep, "creative souls" like to "run rough-shod over
  rules", as you say, but ONE rule that's pretty good to
  stick to is something Shakespeare had Falstaff say:
  "the better part of valor is discretion".  The late
  Buffalo poet/professor/musician John (Jack) Clarke
  once pointed out in class that in addition to the
  admonition to be discreet, this could be heard as a
  "space" statement: you always need to know the
  DISCRETE point in space where you are and act
  accordingly.

  So where were you on the evening of June 17, 2005,
  sir?  I'll tell you--you were on the Poetics Board
  telling Alan Sondheim to do traditionally noble
  humanist things in his writing--"find me the essence
  of the people in a spot where you are...I need to know
  that you can and do see, feel, hear, taste and touch
  the human element of the locals you encounter...From
  what I see and feel of your reports, you remain
  disassociated...Get the fuck out there and mingle,
  make some painful contacts...feed the pigeons and
  embrace the people who sit beside you..."

  Can you understand how this sounds on a list that was
  created to serve the experimental and
  "impossible"--even to people who don't like the work
  and play of Alan Sondheim, and God knows there's a lot
  of dissension about that fellow.  Please, please, be
  HUMAN Alan, you're saying, as if it's so clear what it
  is to be a responsive human in this raging bleeping
  beeping world!

  So I'd say know where you are on this Board, it's
  worth it no matter how much this place is dying...if
  you meditate about all this and still feel you must
  speak boldly for traditional concepts of "human
  expression" then I think you should speak with a
  "loyal oppositionist" tone that acknowledges that you
  are speaking against the grain but there is something
  you want to quietly argue...

  You see, such "indescretion" (as also, your telling
  Charles Bernestein so glibly in early May that surely
  he knows he should be "debunking" Adorno's poetry
  after Auschwitz statement as "utter nonsense") only
  feeds the intense fear/paranoia of some people long
  involved with this list that the wrong people are
  crashing the party and ruining the discourse and
  conducting their dopey open mic...

  Peace to you, Alex, and to all.






  travels, hell creeps like me are all over Poetics.
   Find for me the lady who still wears her wedding gown
  from the day she
  was left standing on the church steps.  Let me hear
  her laughter from
  the recognition of her good fortune at having shed
  herself of the twit.

  Get your ass off the back end of the camera and sit on
  the fucking
  bench; then,
  share their experiences with us, if they'll let you in
  on them.

  Other wise...hurry the fuck home and end this travel
  charade.

HIV/AIDS as the other face of terrorism


this media revamping of reality (bourgeois propaganda) is no different
than what occurred when most diseases were passed via colonizing
europeans who introduced and spread “the sickness”, be it mental or
physical, to the native/indigenous populations thus decimating tribes
and cultures then reworked their role from ethnic cleansers into that of
missionaries and health providers.



About the spamming of propaganda targeting the poor and the nonwhites as
the bringers of disease and destruction in this case of HIV as the other
face of terrorism -- if you do the knowledge, the people who are
engaging in risky behavior and even have encouraged and glamorized the
now POPcult “lifestyle of disease” are white middle class and
professional gay men – conspicuous in their absence on the recent
coverage ,or more, the spam attacks on media sites and within the gay
community will project this ‘positive is negative’ ideology onto the
swarthy, the bisexual, the lower classes and especially those who are in
foreign lands or who do not conform to the global bandwagon of
constructed sexual ideologies as designated by the u.s. (unformed state).

The porn industry, personal ads and party circuits for "barebacking"
videos and adverts, is targeted towards men of the more wealthier erie
noble “mobile” classes, mostly of the leather scene, who use poor youth
and nonwhites to satiate this “life on the edge” desire centered in
boredom, cruelty, power and human life as a chess game. The game can be
seen as the colonizing global business economy creeps on in life as a
likkle death on the backs of extreme poverty and the working poor. So
this risking and attracting the infection, aka. "the gift", becomes a
game of the ruling class and a ebenezeresque endowment to globalization
in order to ‘decrease the surplus population”, disable countries and
communities and have them come along side as the great 8 hold the power
of cures, poisons and research in check.

“This whole notion that ordinary western(er)s can help suffering
starving Africans by having a big party is patronising, shallow and
obscene…” – radio khilafah

The Victorian era used the poor and young males in the same manner as
“rule britiannia” sounded off in a country camouflaged in power and
tragedy of manners covering up it’s hypocrisy, syphilis, murder and
sickness. in these times of increasing legitimizing of the ‘flesh for
funds’ trade agreements which normalizes prostitution as an alternate
income source, and for white youth, as a "coming out process", it is not
coincidental, that neoslavery has become the rule of thumb and that the
gay community is pushing this mental state (from xtrawest to the glossy
amerikkkan puppet masters which bang the macabre dances tunes of lies
and shallow hopes of happiness and conformity), like a kkkanadian with a
infected blanket, wraps it up like a gift to first nations peoples.

“How did this disease come of nowhere and metamorphose
from a gay white male disease to a Black disease,
disproportionately affecting Africa and female African
Americans? If it were a Black disease, we would have
been dying from it before the 1980's.”— Darryl James -- “ The Black Top
Ten: Evidence of Racism”

this media revamping of reality (bourgeois propaganda) is no different
than what occurred when most diseases were passed via colonizing
europeans who introduced and spread “the sickness”, be it mental or
physical, to the native/indigenous populations thus decimating tribes
and cultures then reworked their role from ethnic cleansers into that of
missionaries and health providers. let's not forget the travesty of the
poppy show of "live8" which only serves as the propaganda machine for
the global holocaust of amerikkka and her all lies.

"we felt and had expressed very strongly that the Live 8 and Make
Poverty History campaigns in many ways were taking us back to an
Edwardian era of tea and sympathy, that they were replacing our
political campaigns with philanthropic campaigns. And they were handling
the G8 leaders as if they were the potential saviors of the world, while
completely ignoring and sidelining the harm that they were
doing."--George Monbiot


The posts and the propaganda will, like most media in this denial and
(RE)creation of reality culture, sway the focus away from the privileged
classes of white gay culture (and that gay culture here in british
Columbia) and choose to scapegoat the poor and nonwhites, and even the
population of countries and peoples which seem to defy globalization, as
being the axis of aids and hiv -- we have seen endless posts on china,
cuba, the poor, africa, the caribbean, italy and the increasingly
defiant and radicalized native peoples, whose youth are on the come up,
and who are clashing with the ethnic genocidal block busting practices
of the gentrifying urban and global powers, as the strapped suicide
bombers of hiv and aids. Not so coincidently, adding to alden c.
mayfield’s observation, these native youths are currently joining and
engaging “the mainstream systems of power and knowledge,” therefore
making themselves “able to right the injustices of the past through
political, legal or military intervention.”1. This is no different than
the middle east be it Palestine or other muslim countries, who suffer
far less from, if any, the once, named “gay plague” now HIV and AIDs,
who are making moves to disturb the lies and colonizers and their
traditional romp of rape, plaguing and alternate career sources. Let us
note that with these colonial eerie noble practices the physical and
mental health state soon should “reform” these backwards civilization
and bring them up to the contemporary level of the western world and
it’s global goals of new world medical industry despair and disease –
and with this in the case of HIV as the other face of terrorism we see
“what Indians and Palestinians (and the poor and blacks) share”

there is a summer backyard poetry reading series in
albany. this sunday's reading is for _mem_, the
magazine jill stengel recently started--a magazine of
writing by poets who are mothers and page mothers
(more-established writers who help less-established
writers gain more visibility). the reading has all the
writers from the first issue of mem except for laynie
browne, who will be hosting the event along w/susanna
dyckman. for those of you whom have not yet seen the
magazine, that means the readers are patricia
dienstfrey, dana lomax, jill stengel, elizabeth treadwell, and robin
tremblay-mcgaw.


All readings are on Sundays, beginning at 3pm.  Walk
down the driveway on the left side of the house to the
backyard gate (which will be on your right). Bring a
jacket or sweater, as two large redwood trees in the
yard can block the afternoon sun.  Potluck items
welcome
The address is 632 Evelyn Ave., Albany 94706. The
house is light gray with a very large birch tree in
the front yard and wisteria covering the front porch.

NEO-BENSHI
The latter day art of
Live Film Narration
WHERE: Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, S.F.
701 Mission St. (@ 3rd)
WHEN: THURSDAY, JULY 7, performances at 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.

I have been wanting to say something about this no less than sensational an=
d
wonderful New-Benshi poet-theatrical-film event this past Thursday evening!
Conceived and presented by Konrad Steiner, who together with Roxi Hamilton
invited several Bay Area writers (Brandon Brown, Norma Cole, Stephanie
Young, Rodney Koeneke,  David Larsen and Roxi Hamilton)  to re-imagine the
benshi=B9s art at San Francisco Cinematheque, selecting scenes from films of
their choice.

For the unfamiliar as I was, WHAT is Benshi? From the flier announcement:
The Japanese term benshi means film-teller, and the profession thrived in
Korea and Japan during the silent film era. The benshi would write their ow=
n
narration for silent films which they declaimed on stage, using different
voice characterizations to switch between narrator and various actors.

At Yerba Buena - a small theater - the films were projected on the screen
above the stage  while the poets with a microphone did their work from floo=
r
level and somewhat to the side of the screen. The films  for copyright
reasons could not be named in the program. No need to invite the fear - in
some cases - of Warner Bros. Attorneys in the audience waiting to slam the
poor performer with a megabuck suit for infringement of copyright.

Unfortunately I don't have the in-house program which may have taken the
legal risk and identified the films(?) which varied from a genuinely silent=
,
Japanese work (Norma Cole and MacGinnes) to a 30's Gene Autry quasi-modern
cowboy singing flick (Brandon Brown , Alien, a Sci-Fi flick (Stephanie
Young), Rebel Without a Cause (Roxie Hamilton), an old flick from royal
court behaving India (Rodney Koeneke), and Battle of Troy section from the
Illiad 50's era film starring Peter O'Toole, among others (You can see why =
I
am not a film critic - I should have asked questions and taken notes!).

The results - ringed with narrations and voiceovers - ranged from a high
level of camp hilarity to touching levels of sincerity. Similar to a proces=
s
by which I suspect many of us rewrite and critically interpret any piece of
art with the unraveling of the subliminal notations of either unconscious
negation and/or desire - the poets had a field day offered with the Benshi
form.=20

I don't don't have the time to go into extensive detail. But take, for
example,  Brandon Brown - guitar in hand - singing and narrating along with
Gene Autry & Co.- a film robust with chase scenes on horses, narrow escapes
by young hero and heroine, a single engine Piper Cub and a Ranch Press
Conference. Brandon's Autry parody moved right along with the cowboy shtick
mounting a pastiche in which the bad guys are "the insurgents" - making kin=
d
of light handed but darkly resonant comedy about the lawful and righteous -
including the fictions of Press Conference -  having to deal with this
nuisance encircling the ever innocent Ranch.

In comparison to Brandon, Stephanie Young's refined interior monologue of (=
I
think) romantic and beleaguered intrigue was sandwiched between the heavily
armed woman in "Alien" trying to make her way through a building structure
through which danger lurked at every corner.

And just, O too briefly Rodney Koeneke's virtuoso enactment and faux
translation of the different voices in PYAASA (1957) - the Indian film.
(That might be the real title) - was a great parody of the voices of
authoritarian manipulation, feminine victimization, gangster braha and what
have you.

Unfortunately I could not get Mac McGinnes' voiceover use of Norma Cole's
script - perhaps the most straight on analysis of what was going in this
absolutely haunting Japanese silent film of a party in which all the guests
are wearing masks and a magician roams releasing a seeming ceaseless number
of white doves from his handkerchief.

After an intermission, Roxi Hamilton and David Larsen put on a couple of
tour-de-forces. Roxie took the "chicken" car scene in Rebel Without a Cause
and queered and Freuded the space in most intimate manner - never missing a
double entendre among "the rebels." Maybe a little overdone, but a delight
nevertheless.
Finally, David Larsen who, by education is up to his shoulders in ancient
Greece and that whole end of the world, did a knock-out parody of the
Hollywood "redneck/Hells Angels versus the Pussies" duel at the Battle of
Troy. "Old fuck-face" - sword in hand -was just that as he confronted and
cut that skinny, weak-ass taker of Helen.

Somehow, the evening reminded me of Allen's Bernheimer's Poets Theater in
the Eighties - also here in San Francisco - in the way many of those theate=
r
performances then provided comic relief from the often didactic rigors and
of young Lang Po.  New-Benshi - hardly working against a period of such
rigor - but bouncing off these films gave the writer/performers the chance
to widen the range and permission of their own emerging and strong work (an=
d
against whatever may be the limits of the contemporary poem as a structure)=
.

It was also great fun.=20

=============================================================

A Room Of Her Own


A Foundation For Women Artists & Writers

A Room Of Her Own Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
furthering the vision of writer Virginia Woolf by bridging the often fatal
gap between a woman $B!G (Bs economic reality and her artistic creation.

The foundation was formed in 2000 to provide innovative and practical arts
patronage to women. Through our generous grant program and unique retreat
experiences, A Room of Her Own Foundation works to educate the community
about the work of female artists and writers.

The foundation provides practical help to award recipients in the form of
professional guidance. We are committed to bringing important female
voices, and the important creative work of women, into the spotlight.

The foundation provides annual Gift of Freedom grants of up to $50,000 to
women with creative vision. It is the largest grant of its kind in the
United States.


A Room of Her Own Foundation $B!G (Bs unique approach recognizes and supports
diverse artistic expressions $B!> (Bthe written arts (fiction, creative nonfiction
and poetry) as well as the visual arts (painting, sculpture and
photography).

To be selected for the Gift of Freedom, women applicants not only must
demonstrate their talent, but also their motivation. We are looking for
women who have solid creative goals and a specific project to accomplish
during the two-year term of the grant. We are also interested in helping
women who have a track record of commitment to their art and who are also
making a substantial effort to be self-sufficient.

We also give our award based, in part, on the potential future impact of
the artist $B!G (Bs or writer $B!G (Bs work on the broader community. We support women
with a social, as well as an artistic, vision.

The award recipients have a  $B!H (Bmoral $B!I (B contract to complete their project and
give back to A Room of Her Own Foundation and mentor other Gift of Freedom
recipients.

The successful applicant will have a well articulated creative project
concept and a clear plan for how it may accomplished.

The next award cycle will be in fall of 2006, and will be for fiction.

During the period that a recipient is receiving a grant, the recipient is
required to report and interact with a mentor on an ongoing basis. A
written report setting forth the use of the funds and the progress of the
recipients in her chosen field is required quarterly. At the end of the
grant term a final written report is required to be submitted to AROHO. In
the final report, the recipient is required to account for the funds
granted to her and provide an account of her artistic progress while
receiving the grant. Additionally, at the end of the grant period, each
recipient is required to provide AROHO with documentation regarding the
artist's work for the period. The form of submission to AROHO varies with
the artist's chosen field.

In addition to the financial aspects of the Gift of Freedom Award,
recipients are assigned an individual as a mentor, for advice and dialogue.
Recipients also have access to members of AROHO's Advisory Council. Once a
recipient has progressed in her art, she will be expected to mentor other
AROHO recipients.

AROHO hopes to create educational programs which will instruct the public
about the needs and contributions of women artists, including visits to
schools and other educational opportunities in the broader community.


Guidelines

Each woman interested in receiving financial assistance from AROHO is
required to fill out an application form. Application materials are
available on this website closer to grant application cycle. Check back in
spring of 2006. The application process for a Gift of Freedom Award
includes essays on the applicant's artistic life, an example of the
applicant's artistic expression, and questions involving educational, and
employment history, as well as community service. Complete disclosure of an
applicant's data and assets is required.

The awarding panel deciding the recipients of the Gift of Freedom Awards
will be composed of members of AROHO's
<http://www.aroomofherown.org/get2know_directors.html>Board of Directors,
Advisory Council and volunteers from a wide variety of backgrounds, with
expertise in the arts, business, theology and psychology. These volunteers
are selected by AROHO's Board of Directors based upon their expertise and
interest in women in the arts. Each award is given based upon merits of the
application presented to the awarding panel.

Grants are awarded to deserving women on an objective and nondiscriminatory
basis. The Foundation reserves the right to not grant a Gift of Freedom
Award for any award cycle, if it is determined, in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Foundation's Selection Panel, that there is not an
acceptable application among those submitted to the Foundation for the
award cycle.

I don't think it much matters who "invented" visual
haiku, and I'm sure Scott couldn't care less who gets
credit for it, but I should point out that (in most
cases) the artworks he's calling visual haiku are not
combinations of visual images and words, but consist
of visual images only--generally in the form of
cut-outs from magazines (which sometimes contain text,
but text intended to be viewed averbally).  The
cut-outs are arranged on the page to suggest classical
haiku--i.e., in three lines.  They thus seem to me
translations of the verbal into the visual.
Simple-sounding but quite sophisticated.  I, myself,
would call them visual depictions of haiku rather than
visual haiku, but am not yet ready to go to war over
it.

Subject:      'the universal computer' by martin davis
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

am muddling through a pretty good book at the mo i thought i'd mention: 'the
universal computer' by martin davis (subtitled 'the road from leibniz to
turing'). published in the year 2000.

each chapter looks at the work of a particular mathematician/logician,
starting with leibniz (1646-1716); then George Boole (b. 1822); Gottlob
Frege (b. 1848); Georg Cantor (b. 1845); David Hilbert (b. 1862); Kurt Godel
(b. 1906); Alan Turing (b. 1912). With brief mention of a few other cats
like Charles Babbage (b. 1791).

the book traces the contribution of each of these logicians to "leibniz's
dream" of a machine that can reason. so the book has a great deal to do with
logic and language. it has a lot to do with language since the work of the
above logicians can be seen as advances towards languages in which the
reasoning can take place.

this book also looks, toward the end, at the unfortunate misunderstandings
of searle and penrose. whether or not it is the case that there are thought
processes of which humans are capable but computers are not remains an open
question, notwithstanding things like penrose's simply fallacious proofs
that there are.

we be language machines, to some extent, in our reasoning/thinking. the
degree has not been settled.

i would recommend this book to digital artists interested in the historical
and philosophical/epistemological underpinnings of computing. i would
particularly recommend it to writers involved intensely in the digital,
since it concerns the contemporary interpenetration of language, logic and
reasoning/thinking. digital artists tend to be interested in the confluence
of arts and media. i suggest that the philosophical underpinnings of this
confluence concern language in an extrordinary manner.

martin davis, the author, is a distinguished logician and knows the subject
well. he is a prof emeritus of the courant institute in ny. he has written a
related but more technical book on 'Computability and Unsolvability' and has
put together a book of early papers by logicians on 'The Undecidable'.

the mathematical background required to read 'the universal computer' is
minimal.

So, so saddened by Lorenzo's death. Am proud to have
published his poems and to have known him, however
briefly.  He was brilliant and kind, a combination in
short supply.  Here's a review I wrote of his
EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES a couple years back,
that appeared in SAGETRIEB.  -Mike.

Unlocking the Chain: Lorenzo Thomas's Integrated
Afrocentricity
Michael Magee
        Lorenzo Thomas.  Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric
Modernism and Twentieth-Century American Poetry.
xiv, 271 pp.

Lorenzo Thomas's Extraordinary Measures begins with
a resonant image: Phillis Wheatley and Thomas
Jefferson, sizing each other up.  Their consideration is,
of course, figurative.  Jefferson, not the best reader of
poetry to begin with, finds in Wheatley's work what he
finds in the speech of slaves generally, only "plain
narration."  (One might say that what he has
"discovered" in Wheatley is his own narrative of her,
mirrored back.)  Conversely, Wheatley signifies all over
the democracy which Jefferson helped invent.  Here
and throughout the book Thomas deftly reminds us
what a shift in perspective accomplishes: Jefferson's
much celebrated secularism is in the context of this
relationship less radical than Wheatley's religious
instruction of her "betters."  In a book which ranges
widely over the vales of  Afrocentric modernism and
twentieth century poetry (from Fenton Johnson and
William Stanley Braithwaite to  Ezra Pound, Margaret
Walker and Melvin Tolson, Charles Olson,
lesser-known urban griots, the  polyvocal Black Arts
Movement and a host of younger black writers with pen
to paper this minute) this "original" moment tells us
something about Thomas's view of African-American
writing and speech –– that it is at once insistently
contextual and inexhaustibly playful.

One learns about Umbra Workshop founder Tom
Dent's poems, for instance, through Thomas's
descriptions of Dent's mentor Marcus B. Christian, of
both street-level New Orleans and a mythic, atavistic
New Orleans which Thomas evokes in a remarkable
one page dreamscape which begins, "Let me step
back a minute and show some slides," and ends,
"Slavery" (177).  There is of course the context of the
Umbra Workshop itself, of which Thomas too was a key
member.  But there is also an insistence that personal
and historical contexts not be used to constrain the
possibilities of the words on the page: of the emphatic
line "our turn" in Dent's "Return to English Turn,"
Thomas remarks, "It's hard to say how generous Dent
is in his use of the word 'our.'  That's up to each reader
to ponder" (179).  Pondering it, I think of the Afrocentric
demands for a transvaluation of Western values, for
economic and political re-organization –– all of which
were a  part of the "tattered but tenacious traditions of
black nationalism in the streets" decades before they
received their broadest support and application in the
Black Arts Movement, as Thomas explains so vividly.

But I also think of Dent's self-referential play on poetic
"turning," which is to say, on poetic verse (ptp. s. of
vertere to turn).  As Robert Creeley puts it, "Verse turns,
and takes turns in turning –– which are called verses,
in  my book, like changes –– and not those stanzas or
stops, standstills" (Creeley 576).  Now take something
Creeley once wrote about why he identified with the
Black Arts writers' political commitment ("They are not
fooling, so to speak, and their action tends to follow the
literal pattern of their commitment") and a broad vista of
Afrocentrism and American poetry emerges (538).  It is
one which Thomas anticipates: "While the [Black Arts]
movement rejected mainstream America's ideology,"
he notes, "Black Arts poets maintained and developed
the prosody that they had acquired from Black Mountain
and the Beats" (201).  Thomas explains that this in no
way contradicts (though it may complicate) the
Afrocentrism or the "originality" of the Black Arts poets.
Thomas insists throughout that Afrocentrism is not a
"truth" about Africa but a  polymorphous and effective
form of symbolic action which draws on African as well
as African-American sources; and "originality," as Zora
Neale Hurston wrote, is another word for "the
modifications of ideas" (Hurston 1025).  Nor, however,
does he suggest that, say, a white American poet might
easily claim an Afrocentric heritage or positionality:
again, "It's hard to say."

"Afrocentrism" and "integration," both poetic and social,
are involved in a complex dance in this book, and
Thomas is a tricky choreographer.  Is Braithwaite's "La
Belle de Demerara," the poetic manifestation of
"Caucasianized" values or a Signifying assertion of an
Afro-Caribbean  heritage?  His work as an editor and
his mastery of English metres might well be, like
James Weldon Johnson's life and work, "a bold
personal statement  that 'defied political restrictions'
intended to limit his creative expression"; but what if
"English metres" are socially symbolic acts which
unconsciously preserve the very "political restrictions"
these writers intend to defy?  "Integration" is vexed by
this question as it is vexed by the fact that Braithwaite's
erudition doesn't prevent Pound and Frost from calling
him a "nigger" and doesn't exempt him from Jim Crow.
Both "segregation" and "separation," meanwhile, are
strained by the wild nature of American speech and the
promiscuity of border zones.  In Extraordinary
Measures, Thomas reveals a vast ensemble of African
American poets –– Tolson, Amiri Baraka, Harryette
Mullen, Walker,  Kalamu ya Salaam, Jarbari Aziz Ra
and Erica Hunt to name only a few –– working within
and through these words, their histories and
possibilities.  The aesthetic and the political are neither
held a part nor dissolved into each other here –– as I
said, it is a dance.  And we trust Thomas to run us
through it because, as anyone who has had even a
brief conversation with him can tell you, his talk is like a
hand, both friendly and dead serious, on your shoulder.
Take what he says here about the description of
Malcolm X's death in the Audubon Ballroom in David
Henderson's "They Are Killing All the Young Men" –– its
tone and intent –– as a last enticement to go get this
book:

Echoing the spiritual "Many Thousands Gone" in his
poem, Henderson establishes the connection that is
pinpointed by his allusion to the Audubon's
unbreachable rental schedule.  Commercial enterprise.
The pig-meat emporiums of the Negro elite, with
pictures of white politicians on their walls, are no
different.  Henderson said, chains of barbecue.  You
understand?

14 Below is an exploration of art and environment through the mediums of
paint, music, word, photography, in and out of cyberspace, that speaks to
and from the late 80’s / early 90’s era in the history of downtown New
York City.
Arriving in the neighborhood from Louisville, Kentucky in 1985, John
Ranard discovered a chaotic Hispanic enclave of boarded-up buildings with
souls sleeping on the street in cardboard boxes; real estate agents
appearing in taxis in search for the next big deal; artists, taking
advantage of low rent, moving into store-front studios. In 1989, tents
appeared in Tompkins Square Park as plywood shack villages were erected
in vacant lots. Picking up the dissonance reflected off their studio
walls, artists incorporated this into their work.  This exhibition
recreates this environment and showcases some of the art.
 14 Below showcases the collaborative “voodoo” series executed by Thom
Corn and the late Haitian-born Grady Alexis between 1988 and 1991. The
paintings are intended as a statement of forward-thinking creative unity
in the folkloric tradition of the African diaspora, updated and
modernized on a large scale. Previously exhibited at Under Acme Gallery,
Gallery Taller Latino Americano, and the Poets Café, these works will be
on display again for the first time in fifteen years.
 James Romberger will exhibit his classic pastel drawings of iridescent
people walking Loisida’s flotsam strewn streets
 John Ranard, a social documentary photographer, exhibits here a series
of B&W photographs taken between 1989 and 1993 in the blocks east of
Tompkins Square Park. A group of architectural landscape shots of
rubble-strewn streets joins portraits of shantytown residents to create a
poetic image of life in a time of flux in Alphabet City.
 Jody Culkin, whose sculptures, photographs, and installations have been
exhibited throughout this country and internationally, will show a flash
animation video that tells the story of the firebombing of the building
she lives in by her landlord. The piece will be viewable online at
http://www.clintonstreet.org/; screenshots will be exhibited at the
library gallery.
 o accompany the visual exhibitions, Lower East Side bard John Farris
will read from a short story collection, Raymundo del Mundo, and Tom
Savage will read from his eighth book of poetry, Brain Surgery Poems
(Linear Arts Books, 1999). Saxophonist Charles Gayle adds his free-form
jazz to the evening’s entertainment.
 14 Below will culminate with a special performance on August 24, part of
the FEVA Howl! Festival, when poet Steve Dalachinsky will join violinist
Mat Maneri and jazz pianist Matthew Shipp in performance.

    I see people everyday, but they don't mean what they say. They keep
    hiding all their thoughts like the CIA. Top secret-prostitutes in
    Guantanamo Bay... Nobody listens to the poets of the day. Nobody
    gives a damn for their spiritual blessings I say,

Mountainous regions, up in clouds made of hydrogen,
Souds made of Gods wind, hip-hop- my oxygen.
Venemous. When I spit my syllabus,
Narrow-minded listeners who wanna get rid of us, I
Stick my finger up, singer, I be infamous,
Index, stroke the microphone so ridiculous,
Spinnin' decks, choke the egotistical conspicuous,
Inkjet precision, print visions so meticulous,
Muy muy guapa, call me papa, spit vocipherous,
Fire like you never felt, baby-kid-icarus.
...
No rhymes left for the brain, so I maintain,
Down in my pain, release emotions like Coltrane.
Blast my solo out my soul,
I control those.
Golden Butterflies- I have visions in my eyes,
I see people everyday, but they don't mean what they say.
They keep hiding all their thoughts like the CIA.
Top secret-prostitutes in Guantanamo Bay...
Nobody listens to the poets of the day.
Nobody gives a damn for their spiritual blessings I say,
Rest in peace to Pope John Paul the 2nd.
Rest in peace, even if you're alive,
You got this sex-mad world trying to kill you with dollar-signs.
There's only a few jedi-knights left that's scholars,
I'm aspiring. Trying to be someone.
Trying to make a difference, I'm perspiring like everyone else,
I got my health, so you won't hear me whining for help.
I go with God like Vaya Con Dios.
Vaya Con Dios.
Vaya Con Dios.

---
Adios. Go with God.
Allah make the plans,
We stay open to emotion.
A-dios, insha'Allah.
Stay humble.
All I know is that I know nothing.
---

Sip my lucozade,
Chill by the sunny day,
Even though my teeth may decay, I'm feelin' okay.
Lost love, gain love, gain bigger love.
I said "I'm sick of love" but now I can't get enough.
God bless the freaky flow that I go,
I hope knowledge keeps spreading when I spit this spit dope.
I walks everyday without a focus or microscope.
Just glide to the library, ease down to borders,
Spirited away to a hushed warm cafe where I,
Write my lyrics, puke out my guts.
They don't know what I'm feeling,
As my pen runs wild,
They don't know that Mr.Yoshi is a hip-hop child and I..
Don't really care,
As I'm lost in the stare,
I'm feeling deep,
As I touch my heart and feel air.
Piece of oxygen. I'm so, so often,
Drifting to another world- spirit world, extra sensual world...

And the dates taste good here. ANd these olives taste nice.
And you can eat grapefruits without getting stuff inside your eyes.

---

Adios. Go with God.
Allah make the plans,
We stay open to emotion.
A-dios, insha'Allah.
Stay humble.
All I know is that I know nothing.

Insha'Allah.

Rather too much of literary history, and even more of observation of
spiderWeb poetry lists, suggests to me that reactions to such works would be
dependent on shared group perceptions of the status of their originator, the
'groups' in question being the shadowy networks of alliances, alignments,
oppositions and enmity that ghost the navigation of poetry into public
space. Poetry, like the other arts, and sciences, and in fact more or less
all forms of human collectivity, is as status obsessed as Jane Goodall's
chimps, it is not so much a matter of either what you know or who you know
but who you are seen to be, the agency of that seeing being as impossible to
describe as which fish turns first in school or shoal. The probabilities are
that if someone posted something on this or other lists that 'broke new
ground' etc that it would be as likely that no-one would say anything if the
presenter was not a somehow favourably viewed or well-allied individual.

practice, and their drive to create is greater than their drive to conform.<

Quite likely, but unfortunately the dissociated nature of cybernetic
'communities' makes it even easier for 'uncreative' souls to 'pull the
plug', issue the ban, answer questions with all the force of silence.

My Modest Proposal is that the Poetics List unbundle itself - for example
one could have a Noticeboard for all those worthy notices of events that
most of the members live nowhere in the vicinity of, and for the important
matter of forthcoming publications; A List Called Alan (joke) for creative
outpourings; a Small Ads for those in search of a New York sub-let, and a
Poetics List for the discussion of Poetics (whatever that may be).

Anyhow, I am wearying a little now and feel another etc threatening in the
western skies, something of that sort.


Best

Tod, et alles,

The rules against: "...this is the most unkindest cut of all..." came after
the fact of the  creative writing.

Rules are made for following, unless: ignoring, destroying, abhorring them
harms no one but yourself, in which case, screw the rules!

In my opinion, more often than we perhaps care to recognize, creative souls
run rough-shod over rules, ignoring them right and left no matter who posted
the edict.  And they do that not out of disrespect for rules but rather
because they find rules restrict the creative process they are driven to
practice, and their drive to create is greater than their drive to conform.

I suspect if one were to post on POETICS a poem that broke new ground in
either presentation, or form or metrical stanzaic pattern, or if one wrote a
poem that excited even the nearly dead intellects such as I by either its
wit or its originality, no one of the moderators, editors, authorities on
the list would dare excommunicate the creator of such works.

Here though is the essence of the list to date:

Po'ms
tomes

silence
brilliance

xfe
fex
so paints the saints

But, rules aside,  perhaps the real problem with the list is not the edict
banning poetry; rather it is the failure of the moderators/editors on the
list to realize that there can be no discussion of poetics and poetry
without poetry itself...how sad.

  Dan, you're making the whole issue of "published" much more complicated
than it actually is. No self-published works would be an acceptable rule to
me, but so would including self-published works by authors other than
oneself. Leaves of Grass, obviously, has been published and republished by
many other people than Walt for a long time. I don't believe that it does
happen a lot that editors of highly respected presses publish their own
books. There are a few exceptions, like Scalapino, who published Crowd and
not evening or light through her O Books. If it's a respected press, then
include it. If you think it's an amazing work that someone unfortunately had
to publish themselves, include it. Rules are guidelines, not absolutes, and
people always take liberties. I've definitely seen poems on this list, as it
is. Quote from blogs--why not? Quote from online galleries and journals that
include electronic, multimedia, and hybrid works. Now just how much is
excluded? Any parameters
   will
   necessarily exclude something, but some limits are necessary. I don't
think it's as complicated as you find it to be, I don't personally find the
issue of what constitututes "published" all that interesting or complex,
rather a bit tedious. It really is a matter of common sense. Your splitting
hairs with nothing more at stake than whether you can "officially" quote a
certain poem on this list that might be excluded from the rules.

  But I do agree with you that it seems odd (at best) for a poetics list to
institute a complete moratorium on the inclusion of poems...

  Maybe the old 50 posts per day limit would work again, though. Does anyone
know why this was abandoned originally? I suppose I can imagine that, with
around 10000 participants, many people might never get to the head of the
line, and that might be more of a problem.

  So, yes, how 'bout changing the rules a bit?


  Best,

  Tod

  Who does? I'm not entirely convinced that was the motivation behind
  going poemless, but even if it was, it seems ill-advised for the
  solution to be, "all right then, NO poems at all". But, this is a very
  American response, now that I think of it. We like the easy solution
  of eliminating the good with the bad in the name of saving us from the
  bad. The examples are legion.

  I'm curious, how would you define "published"? Does self-publishing
  count (Leaves of Grass)? What if you're a highly respected press and
  you publish a manuscript of your own through your own press (this
  happens a lot)? How about if it's on a blog (the choices are too many
  to pick this early)? How about in the comments of a blog? What about
  posted to a series of listservs reaching a total number of people
  greater than the circulation of Poetry (Alan Sondheim, August
  Highland, Lanny Quarles, mez, etc)? What constitutes the publishing of
  a piece of hypermedia (Jim Andrews)? Do we only talk about things
  published by Seagate? What about a poet who declaims all publication
  entirely (Jesse Taylor for the 20 years up until this week)?

  The welcome message for the Poetics list says that posting to this
  list is itself considered by the Editorial Board as a form of
  publication.

  I can't imagine a criteria for what would legitimately constitute
  "published" that wouldn't also exclude at least as much vital work as
  it includes.

  Particularly now, in this very exciting time of the digital dancing
  with literature, on a digitally facilitated list, the kind of work
  this list's welcome message says its open to is often (but certainly
  not exclusively) precisely the kind of work that is non-publishable,
  or apublished, or is in the act of birthing a whole new definition of
  what published means.

  Even if a workable definition could be found, I think a list that
  claims to be open to the impossible in theory, but in practice only
  allows the citation of the published is untenable.

  I also think the notion of what constitutes "published" today is one
  of the most exciting questions in all of literature. I am the type of
  person who doesn't really do very well at talking about that
  question. I am pretty good, however, at thinking of different ways to
  say "well, how about this!?" And I think it's essential to the dialog
  to include people of both kinds. Without the former, the discussion
  will probably never really happen in any kind of structured way, and
  without the latter, the discussion would never have come up in the
  first place because there would have been no deviation from the norm
  anyway. Lively discussion requires both sides.

  Not really. The list was an open mic for a decade and the simple
  measures of limiting individuals to 2 posts per day and the entire
  list to 50 posts per day was effective at stopping the "if no one
  minds, I'll just go ahead and read a dozen more" syndrome.

  And I think there is no better way to say you're NOT interested in the
  new and emerging, the experimental and the impossible, than to say
  you've given up on open readings. Yeah, they can be painfully bad
  sometimes. But they are also sometimes brilliant, engaging, and
  instructive in the art of being human.

  Absolutely this would be better. And this is precisely why I suggested
  that the Editorial Board do some of that discussion starting. Because
  in an environment where there is this much control coming from the
  top, you don't find a lot of people stepping up to test out whether
  any given topic is going to end up causing a rule change on them. It
  may be of interest to note here that I've had far more back channel
  responses of support than total responses on the list. Why would that
  be? Because people are more comfortable with it. And if the goal here
  is to encourage discussion, that's a failure.

  And, actually, I believe have started a more engaged, rigorous
  discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

  I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
  great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome message
  be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
  situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
  the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
  as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
  publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
  so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
  don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
  underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

  I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
  other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all kinds
  have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
  think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, and
  the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

  I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

  Dan


  There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

Subject:      New Atticus/Finch Chapbook! Donovan and Schlesinger's _Mantle_!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Atticus/Finch is pleased to announce the release of its fifth (and
first collaborative) chapbook, _Mantle_, by Thom Donovan and Kyle
Schlesinger. What began as a meditative conversation on the work of
George Oppen quickly found its form as POETRY: i.e. thought as
action / discourse / community. The poem “poms” to and fro, suspended
in the still of Oppen’s clarity and truth, materializing out of the
endemic conditions of “response” as immediate (mediated) affect/effect-
ive rest-full-ness. The result, needless to say, is a dizzying
articulation of palimpsestual “preservation” (read: “PROGRESS”).

Our discerning customers will recognize Schlesinger as the editor of
Kiosk magazine and Cuneiform Press. Add Donovan (a chimerical seer of
sorts: one part Zukofsky, one part Taggart, one part seriously gifted
occult-ured medium) to the short list of poets who strike like a brick
out of ether!

Jesse Seldess writes of _Mantle_:

These “vivid section”[s] much more than divide or connect. They are an
intertaking portraiture of “What conveys you.” In extension of Oppen’s
thing among things, Schlesinger and Donovan’s exchange treads and, in
treading, covers and finds itself covered, reflexively constituting
the extent to which we are “Too particular to place.”

Gregg Biglieri, with characteristic brevity, adds:

_Mantle_ is not simply a collaborative poem, but rather a dialogue of
sight and sound, a duet performed between two tightrope walkers, Bach-
to-Bach. The fugue is the form that makes what appears far away seem
but between. It is sung in unison, seen in the seams, sewn in
chromatic scales, and “visible in / a divisible stretch for” what is
nameless in things. Insomnia is not an ambient environment, it’s
chronic.

Where Hegel says “Now is night,” we hear “Nocturne around.” The proper
way to read this poem is neither to zoom in nor fade out, but rather
to not fade away. If someone says “Speech acts,” remember to ask what
role it plays?

If we understand that “Optics chooses some and not others,” perhaps
acoustics chisels down those who stand under a jetty—ears wide shut.

As you read this poem you might feel “as if you were not a camera,”
but a conch, and the mistake you will be making is trying to hear the
ocean through your eyes. But “your means mine” and so this poem is
about what moves through us as we read “Our names only” into
these “divides stills.” Here we stand knowing that no one’s cleft
standing.

***What’s more, clocking in at just over fifty pages, this mammoth
volume makes for one serious $6 chapbook. As always, Atticus/Finch
recognizes the worth of your hard-earned cash!

Put a check in the mail NOW before this thing implodes under the
weight of its own concentration!

    Dan, you're making the whole issue of "published" much more =
complicated
  than it actually is. No self-published works would be an acceptable =

    Who does? I'm not entirely convinced that was the motivation behind

    I'm curious, how would you define "published"? Does self-publishing
    count (Leaves of Grass)? What if you're a highly respected press and
    you publish a manuscript of your own through your own press (this
    happens a lot)? How about if it's on a blog (the choices are too =
many
    to pick this early)? How about in the comments of a blog? What about
    posted to a series of listservs reaching a total number of people
    greater than the circulation of Poetry (Alan Sondheim, August
    Highland, Lanny Quarles, mez, etc)? What constitutes the publishing =
of
    a piece of hypermedia (Jim Andrews)? Do we only talk about things
    published by Seagate? What about a poet who declaims all publication
    entirely (Jesse Taylor for the 20 years up until this week)?

    The welcome message for the Poetics list says that posting to this
    list is itself considered by the Editorial Board as a form of
    publication.

    I can't imagine a criteria for what would legitimately constitute
    "published" that wouldn't also exclude at least as much vital work =
as
    it includes.

    Particularly now, in this very exciting time of the digital dancing
    with literature, on a digitally facilitated list, the kind of work
    this list's welcome message says its open to is often (but certainly
    not exclusively) precisely the kind of work that is non-publishable,
    or apublished, or is in the act of birthing a whole new definition =
of
    what published means.

    Even if a workable definition could be found, I think a list that
    claims to be open to the impossible in theory, but in practice only
    allows the citation of the published is untenable.

    I also think the notion of what constitutes "published" today is one
    of the most exciting questions in all of literature. I am the type =
of
    person who doesn't really do very well at talking about that
    question. I am pretty good, however, at thinking of different ways =
to
    say "well, how about this!?" And I think it's essential to the =
dialog
    to include people of both kinds. Without the former, the discussion
    will probably never really happen in any kind of structured way, and
    without the latter, the discussion would never have come up in the
    first place because there would have been no deviation from the norm
    anyway. Lively discussion requires both sides.

    Not really. The list was an open mic for a decade and the simple
    measures of limiting individuals to 2 posts per day and the entire
    list to 50 posts per day was effective at stopping the "if no one
    minds, I'll just go ahead and read a dozen more" syndrome.

    And I think there is no better way to say you're NOT interested in =
the
    new and emerging, the experimental and the impossible, than to say
    you've given up on open readings. Yeah, they can be painfully bad
    sometimes. But they are also sometimes brilliant, engaging, and
    instructive in the art of being human.

    Absolutely this would be better. And this is precisely why I =
suggested
    that the Editorial Board do some of that discussion starting. =
Because
    in an environment where there is this much control coming from the
    top, you don't find a lot of people stepping up to test out whether
    any given topic is going to end up causing a rule change on them. It
    may be of interest to note here that I've had far more back channel
    responses of support than total responses on the list. Why would =
that
    be? Because people are more comfortable with it. And if the goal =
here
    is to encourage discussion, that's a failure.

    And, actually, I believe have started a more engaged, rigorous
    discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

    I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
    great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome =
message
    be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
    situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
    the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
    as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
    publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
    so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
    don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
    underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

    I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
    other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all =
kinds
    have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
    think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, =
and
    the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

    I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

    Dan


    There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

Charlotte: Where can I look at this piece? I belong to a group called NYCC
(New York Composers Conference) & they would like to start presenting
multi-media works. They are friends of mine & I'm sort of an inactive member, basically
because I don't have the imagination (or experience) for either composition or
multi-media work. I'm trying to do an art-poetry piece with a friend in
Chicago, but the distance makes it difficult.

Thanks, Debbie

TEMPORARY CHAPBOOK
I've posted a temporary chapbook online in PDF format. The work contains 9 poems, both new and unpublished work, including "Spokane," which was recently finalist in Web Del Sol's online poetry competition, nominated by Didi Menendez, editor of the online journal MiPoesis. There is also a WMV media file of images extracted from documentary footage I shot while in Spokane.

SUMMER POETRY PROGRAM
The summer poetry program I'm leading has a number of wonderful guest poets. Tanya Larkin, Sophie Wadsworth, Maria Luisa Arroyo, winners of the Mass. Cultural Council Poetry Fellowship, and Franz Wright are each leading an afternoon session with the kids.

Me too.

The last I heard from him, ages ago, was he was going offline.

He sent me his snailmail address but (typically) I managed to misplace it.

So any contact information would be appreciated.

===============================

Black Fatherhood Anthology ISO Submissions

Kinship Press, a Philadelphia-based imprint,  is soliciting personal
essays of not more than 1,500 words from men or women  who can tell
a short, uplifting anecdote or thumbnail sketch of a loving,  supportive
black father who was willing to make enormous sacrifices to  raise
healthy, productive children. The selected essays will appear in  an
anthology designed to paint a well-rounded portrait of black men  as
loving, committed role models. A portion of the proceeds from  the

of course, counting syllables is not prescribed anymore.  you know the =
rap - English "syllables" don't equate in Japanese.  much has been =
written and researched about this.  the syllable count is only a very =
rough guideline.

Hi Alex

I get seriously worried when someone implies I am right about something - I
am so habituated to being told I am wrong I find it difficult to deal with
acceptance. I recall the first poem I ever wrote, it was at school in my
13teens. I had wrote from my year dot but it had been prose that I was
interested in. Teacher told us to write a poem for homework, so I did, but
school in question was a 'secondary modern' in the poorest part of town
where the kids were destined to be factory fodder. The homework was handed
in, we had little books upon which Teacher would put marks and comments in
his red pen, the next day after the books were returned and to my puzzlement
mine was unmarked. I took trhe notebook to Teacher (mine had been pointedly
handed back last) at his Mighty Desk and querously queried why mine was
unmarked. 'Where did you copy that from?' was his reply.

That was my introduction to the world of poetry: I even complained to the
headmaster who sympathised and believed the poem was my own work but said
that he could not undermine the Teacher's authority. This was where I
realised  I do not exist: I have carried on not existing ever since. As a
non-person I have noticed (SADLY) just how bourgeiose the poetic scene is. I
have sometimes wished I was black because at least then I would fit in with
the rhetorics of comformity, but being a white heterosexual middle-aged
working class male who is nothing like Phil Collins but has a penchant for
left-wing libertarian politics, eccentric religious interests, Bach, Vallejo
and Celan, I should not BE.

It does not matter that I have books to my name, that I am a good editor,
that I am widely published, I am not supposed to exist.

So I am left to hug my invisibility, volubly.

Best

Dave

    Dan, you're making the whole issue of "published" much more complicated
  than it actually is. No self-published works would be an acceptable rule
to
  me, but so would including self-published works by authors other than
  oneself. Leaves of Grass, obviously, has been published and republished by
  many other people than Walt for a long time. I don't believe that it does
  happen a lot that editors of highly respected presses publish their own
  books. There are a few exceptions, like Scalapino, who published Crowd and
  not evening or light through her O Books. If it's a respected press, then
  include it. If you think it's an amazing work that someone unfortunately
had
  to publish themselves, include it. Rules are guidelines, not absolutes,
and
  people always take liberties. I've definitely seen poems on this list, as
it
  is. Quote from blogs--why not? Quote from online galleries and journals
that
  include electronic, multimedia, and hybrid works. Now just how much is
  excluded? Any parameters
     will
     necessarily exclude something, but some limits are necessary. I don't
  think it's as complicated as you find it to be, I don't personally find
the
  issue of what constitututes "published" all that interesting or complex,
  rather a bit tedious. It really is a matter of common sense. Your
splitting
  hairs with nothing more at stake than whether you can "officially" quote a
  certain poem on this list that might be excluded from the rules.

    But I do agree with you that it seems odd (at best) for a poetics list
to
  institute a complete moratorium on the inclusion of poems...

    Maybe the old 50 posts per day limit would work again, though. Does
anyone
  know why this was abandoned originally? I suppose I can imagine that, with
  around 10000 participants, many people might never get to the head of the
  line, and that might be more of a problem.

    So, yes, how 'bout changing the rules a bit?


    Best,

    Tod

    Who does? I'm not entirely convinced that was the motivation behind
    going poemless, but even if it was, it seems ill-advised for the
    solution to be, "all right then, NO poems at all". But, this is a very
    American response, now that I think of it. We like the easy solution
    of eliminating the good with the bad in the name of saving us from the
    bad. The examples are legion.

    I'm curious, how would you define "published"? Does self-publishing
    count (Leaves of Grass)? What if you're a highly respected press and
    you publish a manuscript of your own through your own press (this
    happens a lot)? How about if it's on a blog (the choices are too many
    to pick this early)? How about in the comments of a blog? What about
    posted to a series of listservs reaching a total number of people
    greater than the circulation of Poetry (Alan Sondheim, August
    Highland, Lanny Quarles, mez, etc)? What constitutes the publishing of
    a piece of hypermedia (Jim Andrews)? Do we only talk about things
    published by Seagate? What about a poet who declaims all publication
    entirely (Jesse Taylor for the 20 years up until this week)?

    The welcome message for the Poetics list says that posting to this
    list is itself considered by the Editorial Board as a form of
    publication.

    I can't imagine a criteria for what would legitimately constitute
    "published" that wouldn't also exclude at least as much vital work as
    it includes.

    Particularly now, in this very exciting time of the digital dancing
    with literature, on a digitally facilitated list, the kind of work
    this list's welcome message says its open to is often (but certainly
    not exclusively) precisely the kind of work that is non-publishable,
    or apublished, or is in the act of birthing a whole new definition of
    what published means.

    Even if a workable definition could be found, I think a list that
    claims to be open to the impossible in theory, but in practice only
    allows the citation of the published is untenable.

    I also think the notion of what constitutes "published" today is one
    of the most exciting questions in all of literature. I am the type of
    person who doesn't really do very well at talking about that
    question. I am pretty good, however, at thinking of different ways to
    say "well, how about this!?" And I think it's essential to the dialog
    to include people of both kinds. Without the former, the discussion
    will probably never really happen in any kind of structured way, and
    without the latter, the discussion would never have come up in the
    first place because there would have been no deviation from the norm
    anyway. Lively discussion requires both sides.

    Not really. The list was an open mic for a decade and the simple
    measures of limiting individuals to 2 posts per day and the entire
    list to 50 posts per day was effective at stopping the "if no one
    minds, I'll just go ahead and read a dozen more" syndrome.

    And I think there is no better way to say you're NOT interested in the
    new and emerging, the experimental and the impossible, than to say
    you've given up on open readings. Yeah, they can be painfully bad
    sometimes. But they are also sometimes brilliant, engaging, and
    instructive in the art of being human.

    Absolutely this would be better. And this is precisely why I suggested
    that the Editorial Board do some of that discussion starting. Because
    in an environment where there is this much control coming from the
    top, you don't find a lot of people stepping up to test out whether
    any given topic is going to end up causing a rule change on them. It
    may be of interest to note here that I've had far more back channel
    responses of support than total responses on the list. Why would that
    be? Because people are more comfortable with it. And if the goal here
    is to encourage discussion, that's a failure.

    And, actually, I believe have started a more engaged, rigorous
    discussion and debate. I've even mentioned published poems in it.

    I see no harm either. If that's the direction they want to go,
    great. That's why I offered as suggestion #1 that the welcome message
    be reworded to more accurately reflect the reality of the
    situation. If the list is too big (though I don't think it is), and
    the Editorial Board wants to limit discussion to works that are only
    as impossible as can be managed within the confines of a print
    publication produced by a known and reputable press, they should say
    so. Because wearing the cape of Defender of the Impossible when you
    don't have the rest of the suit on, makes you look a little
    underdressed when you fly over the local neighborhoods.

    I'm not saying this goal/approach has no or even less value than any
    other approach. I'm saying that organizational groupings of all kinds
    have a tendency to attract the kind of people they say they want. I
    think what is wanted here has necessarily evolved over the years, and
    the welcome message has not evolved gracefully along with it.

    I'm a poet, so I want the words to be right.

    Dan


    There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

No, Robin, he didn't say who he thought I'd copied it off, which wasn't
suprising as he was semi-literate, I think his problem was that poem
contained references to figures like Orpheus which in his view of the world
no kid from a council flat in the heart of Brum could possibly know about. I
haven't preserved the poem - i doubt it was that good btw - i was just told
to write a poem so i did.

But that was the true induction to the joys of non-existence. It isn't only
I who am not supposed to be, but all my confreres, poor little Vicky, Colin,
Marco, Dick Ball, Eugene, Lydia etc, none of us should be.  Memorably, on a
certain other list, a middle class poet-editor described the road on which
we live as a place where 'no-one could be said to live'. Meantime, although
living in social housing and on income support, I do not read the Sun nor
dream of winning the lottery but instead listen to radio 3, love the singing

Olson's work presented in film screening

By Gail McCarthy
Staff writer

The public will have a chance to view a rough cut of a film about a
renowned Gloucester poet Charles Olson at a special event at the Cape
Ann Historical Museum on Saturday.

The film screening is sponsored by The Charles Olson Society, which
will take place at 3 p.m. at the museum located downtown on Pleasant
Street.

The free program includes readings from the works of Charles Olson by
members of the society in addition to the screening by local
filmmaker Henry Ferrini.

"Charles Olson was known mainly to other poets, but he had a lot to
say not just to poets but to everyone, especially today," said
Ferrini. "There's a certain relevance to his work today because he
talks about the community and the importance of people living in this
small polis. He spoke to this place through his poetry."

A major figure in American poetry, Olson lived from 1910 to 1970.
Ferrini, 52, wants to share the talents of Olson with others, and to
that end he began this film 10 years ago.

At the screening, the audience will see the first 30 minutes of what
will be a 56-minute, 40-second movie.

"That is essentially a PBS hour," said Ferrini. This film, when
finished, will be aired on public television.

Ferrini interested Hollywood actor John Malkovich in donating his
services as narrator.

"He's very scholarly and has an interest in literature and poetry,"
said Ferrini. "We were able to get word to him to see if he'd be
interested. He appears in part of the rough cut. He reads Charles
Olson as good as Charles Olson."

Born in Worcester, Olson was a summer resident here as a child.
Later, his mother moved here. Olson moved to an apartment at 28 Fort
Square with his wife and son.

Before moving to Cape Ann, Olson began teaching in 1948 at Black
Mountain College in North Carolina, which was an experimental
educational project. He became a visiting lecturer. From 1951 until
its closing in 1956, Olson served as rector of the college.

"Because he experienced the magic quality of being a child who comes
here in the summer time, this place became paradisiacal for him,"
said Ferrini.

Gloucester would later become the subject of a major epic poem by
Olson titled "The Maximum Poems."

The epic began as letters Olson wrote to Gloucester's Vincent
Ferrini, a contemporary of the local poet and Gloucester's poet
laureate.

"He is important, in part, because he wrote a lot of material about
this place," said Henry Ferrini. "But so few people read poetry
anymore. One reason to do my film is to give a window into this man.
It's a showcase for some of his poetry."

When asked to comment on Olson's work, Ferrini quoted from the U.S.
poet laureate from 2001 to 2003, Billy Collins:

"You don't read poetry to find out about another person, you read
poetry to find about yourself."

Ferrini, an award-winning filmmaker, still needs to raise about
$75,000 to finish the film.

His last film, "Lowell Blues," about poet Jack Kerouac, king of the
Beats, aired on PBS and in 12 European countries. It will be shown at
an international film festival in London next March.

If you have not seen this, I believe it sums up the Rove Biz.

Rove Unfit for Public Office

Whether the courts can and will punish Karl Rove for telling Time
Magazine's Matthew Cooper that Joe Wilson's wife was a CIA operative
should be beside the point. That's for the courts to decide.

The real question is whether we want a person to occupy a high office
in the White House when that person has cynically endangered US
national security to take a petty sort of revenge on a whistleblower.

Ambassador Joe Wilson, who once dared Saddam to hang him while wearing
a rope around his neck while acting ambassador in Baghdad in fall of
1990, was the first to let the American people know that the Bush
administration lied about Iraq's alleged attempt to purchase uranium
yellowcake from Niger. Wilson went to that country, investigated the
structure of the uranium industry (which is mainly in French hands
anyway), and concluded it was impossible. Bush and Cheney had believed
a set of forged documents manufactured by a former employee of Italian
military intelligence. (In the US, the only major public intellectual
with close ties to Italian military intelligence is pro-war gadfly
Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute).

In revenge, Rove tried to discredit Wilson and perhaps also punish him
and his family. The purpose of such punishment is always to bully and
terrorize other employees, as well as to shut up the whistleblower.
Since the Bush administration has done so many illegal things, if
Washington insiders started blowing the whistle, there could be a
hundred Watergates. Rove let everyone in Washington know that he would
destroy anyone who dared step forward. The White House also dealt with
former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil when he blew the whistle on the
Bush planning for and Iraq War in January of 2001 (look at the date).
They threatened O'Neill with jail time for revealing classified
information, even though O'Neill had never been given any. He
subsequently fell quiet. It is also said that the Bushies tried to
prevent Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general, from getting any
consulting gigs in Washington because he opposed the Iraq war.

But Rove's revenge on Wilson was the ultimate. Plame was undercover as
an employee of a phony energy company. She was actually investigating
illegal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. When Rove blew
her cover to the US press, everyone who had ever been seen with her in
Africa or Asia was put in extreme danger. It is said that some of her
contacts may have been killed. Imagine the setback to the US struggle
against weapons of mass destruction proliferation that this represents.
Rove marched us off to Iraq, where there weren't any. But he disrupted
a major effort by the CIA to fight WMD that really did exist.

Moreover, the whole thing only makes sense if Rove is a wild-eyed
conspiracy theorist to begin with. Why would it matter that Valerie
Plame suggested to the CIA that they send her husband Joe Wilson to
Niger? Wilson had excellent credentials for the mission, which the CIA
immediately recognized.

Rove can only have thought it would discredit Wilson to associate his
mission with the CIA if he viewed the CIA as the enemy. This is the
Richard Perle line. If Wilson was sent to Niger on the recommendation
of a CIA operative, then he was not an objective ex-ambassador but a
CIA plant of some sort, attempting to undermine the Bush administration
and the military occupation of Iraq.

This theory is that of a crackpot. The actions are those of a traitor.
What is the difference between Robert Hanssen revealing key secret
information for money to the Soviets and Karl Rove revealing it to the
proliferators for political gain for the Republican Party and the Bush
White House? Both are traitors who traded secrets for gain.

A man who would do what Rove did should not be in the White House in
any capacity. And no person who tolerates a man like Rove in the White
House should be commander in chief of American security.

Bringing a poet back to the people
Gloucester filmmaker documents work of Charles Olson

By James Sullivan, Globe Correspondent  |  July 14, 2005

Herman Melville was out of fashion when a young Massachusetts scholar
named Charles Olson began studying the author in the 1930s. Olson's
first book, ''Call Me Ishmael," completed in 1945, was a critical
reassessment that would help establish a new era of Melville
appreciation.

Sixty years later, it is Olson's reputation that could use a boost.
In his lifetime, he had plenty of admirers. His theory of spoken
poetry cleared the path for the Beats and performance poetry, and
Olson's was the leading voice in the groundbreaking 1960 anthology
''The New American Poetry." In academic circles, he is often counted
as one of the most influential poets of the 20th century.

Yet Olson, who died in 1970, is largely forgotten by the reading
public. Even in his adopted hometown of Gloucester -- the subject of
his greatest work, the epic series of laments known as the ''Maximus"
poems -- he is scarcely remembered by the ordinary citizens for whom
he felt he was writing.

Gloucester filmmaker Henry Ferrini wants to usher in a new era of
appreciation for the writer. Ten years in the making, Ferrini is in
the final phases of ''Poet & the City," a documentary on Olson and
his beloved seaport. This Saturday, the filmmaker will host an event
at the Cape Ann Historical Association including a screening of his
work-in-progress and readings by Olson scholars.

Ferrini hopes to complete his film by April 2006, which is National
Poetry Month. But he has labored to convince potential investors that
Olson's vision of Gloucester's modernization is not just a local
story.

''It's difficult to get people to understand that this man spoke for
everyone," says Ferrini.

A past finalist for a major grant from the Independent Television
Service, which connects producers with public television stations,
the filmmaker hopes to land the prize this year.

In the meantime, he continues to raise money as he has for a decade
-- by soliciting donations, however modest, from Olson enthusiasts,
Cape Ann preservationists, and other friends of the arts.

From the ground-floor workspace of his old hillside home in
Gloucester, Ferrini points toward the waterfront along Rocky Neck.
''There's usually a $14 million yacht parked out there," he says.
Laughing, he recalls the time he tried to enlist the owner as an
investor.

For Ferrini, the presence of that yacht is a constant reminder that
Olson's work was about the changing face of Gloucester and, by
extension, the country -- the problems of urban renewal, absentee
ownership, and the growing disparity between the haves and the
have-nots. Olson himself, says the filmmaker, sometimes lived in
''abject poverty." The poet Diane DiPrima told Ferrini about hosting
a rent party in New York for Olson in the late 1950s, when he needed
$29 for the landlord.

DiPrima is one of countless poets for whom Olson's writing was a
revelation, a crucial link between T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and the
colloquialism of the Beat generation and other postwar iconoclasts.

''Olson found a way to write poetry that combined an interaction with
the subject with what was going on in his mind," says Peter Anastas,
a Gloucester native who edited Olson's ''Maximus to Gloucester"
letters to the Gloucester Daily Times, in which the poet argued for
the preservation of the city's heritage in verse. ''It was a mind in
action with the world. It was a tremendous breakthrough in poetry."

After studying at Wesleyan, Yale, and Harvard, Olson embarked on a
promising career in politics, serving in Franklin Roosevelt's
administration and for the Democratic National Committee. In 1944,
however, he resigned from his post at the Office of War Information
in favor of the literary life.

During his tenure in the 1950s at Black Mountain, the experimental
North Carolina college, Olson influenced many future writers and
artists with his impassioned, marathon classes. Jack Kerouac once
made a pilgrimage to Olson's kitchen in Gloucester, where the poet
settled for good in the 1950s, and Allen Ginsberg read at Olson's
funeral. But despite such widespread influence, Olson is not nearly
as familiar to the reading public as many of his followers.

''His work is being concreted over in this media age," says Ferrini,
who has secured a narrating commitment from the actor John Malkovich
to help get his film noticed. A onetime music teacher who has found a
niche in film by setting writers' words to images, Ferrini is perhaps
best known for ''Lowell Blues," his lyrical ode to Kerouac's
hometown. Another Ferrini production, ''Poem in Action," is a profile
of Vincent Ferrini -- Gloucester's irrepressible poet laureate and
Henry's uncle.

The life of the elder Ferrini, now a hearty 92, is forever entwined
with Olson's. Olson, born in Worcester, vacationed as a child in
Gloucester, establishing his lifelong attachment to the place. As a
young man he summered in Gloucester, working as a substitute letter
carrier.

On a return visit in 1949, Olson sought out Vincent Ferrini. Olson
began his ''Maximus" poems -- named in part for his own mountainous
body -- as letters to Ferrini.

Though their relationship had its troubles, the two men remained
friends. The problem, Vincent Ferrini says today, was that he had
already settled in Gloucester. When Olson arrived to stay, he wanted
the city all to himself.

For the elder Ferrini, the perception that Olson is a poet of the
elite -- revered in the ivory tower, but irrelevant to the working
class he defended -- is accurate. ''I reached people he could never
reach," he says.

But for Anastas, who knew Olson during his later years, the poet's
writing could be powerfully direct. As an example he suggests an
infamous line -- ''Oh city of mediocrity and cheap ambition" -- from
one of Olson's angry letters to the local paper, after the demolition
of a historic home.

''I mean, that's pretty straightforward," he says. ''And people paid
attention. People knew that something important was happening when
Olson was speaking to them."

For the past two years, Gloucester High School English teacher James
Cook has been using Olson's writing as part of a program designed to
teach students new ways of looking at their surroundings.

''A lot of the kids have a sense that there's something limited about
living in a mass-mediated world," he says. ''They know more about TV
characters than they do about their neighbors or the local
government. Olson proposes a method of living in a place and
responding to it."

Cook says his students have discovered that Olson's poetry can be as
practical as it is heady. ''The fact that he is sometimes credited
with popularizing the word 'postmodernism' -- they don't care." The
students are much more interested, he says, in the idea that Olson
thought Gloucester's iconic ''The Man at the Wheel" statue was bad
art.

Like that statue, Olson himself could become an attraction for the
city if all goes well with Ferrini's film. With seldom-seen archival
footage of the poet and moving images of Gloucester set to his words,
the filmmaker hopes his documentary might do for the city what the
Kerouac legacy has done for Lowell.

''Gloucester," as the poet Ed Sanders told Ferrini, ''doesn't know
what a tremendous tourist attraction Olson could be."

Henry Ferrini will present a rough cut of ''Poet & the City" at 3
p.m. Saturday at the Cape Ann Historical Association, 27 Pleasant
St., Gloucester. Readings will be given by Olson scholars, including
Gerrit Lansing, Schuyler Hoffman, Charles Stein, and James Cook. The
program is free.

Hi everyone,

Could you all send me names of Irish experimental/innovative poets? I'm
looking specifically for people currently living in Ireland, or people born
in Ireland but who have since moved elsewhere.

Thanks,

Gary

I like the unintentional grammatical ambiguity of the thread title. I have
experience of some of those names, as an editor, and I must note there is a
slight problem that their verses are flat their egos are inflated and what
they write is BORING. I felt sorry for them so I published a bit of their
stuff with the result that I got back-stabbed and abused from them beyond
compare. I like the careless use of words like innovative, if this lot come
anywhere near it is being tedious at something approaching the speed of
light.

Subject:      Charles Olson Film/Upcoming NYC event
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Attended the preview today in Gloucester of Henry Ferrini's new film, still in process, on Charles Olson. Event took place at the Cape Ann Historical Society, 27 Pleasant St, in downtown Gloucester. There were 144 chairs set up in a basement room, with total attendance approaching 200. Readings of Olson's works preceeded the film. Reading were filmmaker Henry Ferrini; Ellen Soloman, Skylar Hoffman, Amanda Cook, Chuck Stein, and Ken Irby, all members of the Charles  Olson Society (Hoffman is president); Shelby, Stephanie, Chris, and Laura, four current and recent Gloucester High students, introduced by James Cook. The preponderance of works read were from The Maximus Poems, with their Gloucester connection. The film, a 30 minute rough cut, was quite good. The good news is that it will be shown again at St. Mark's on 12/3 in association with a program to take place throughout that day called "OLSON NOW." Ammiel Alcalay announced the event, calling it an open forum. Alcalay said
 a blog would be forthcoming within a few weeks at factoryschool.org. Henry Ferrini is actively raising funds for the completion of the film, which he projects to be completed in April 2006. Tax deductible donations can be made payable to The Center for Independent  Documentary and sent to Henry Ferrini, 5 Wall St, Gloucester, MA 01930. I was really quite amazed by the rought cut, which affirms Olson's place for what poets already know it to be. Olson's story as told by the film seems fresh and unscripted, testament to a vast and far-reaching intellect. With the exception of a glassy eyed John Malkovich reading, but not seeming to be very excited by--at least not in the way poets seem to be--selections from Projective Verse, this thing kicks ass. See you 12/3.

Dear list, You guys are hot so I thought you'd like to be water models.  If
you want to be part of my water poems here's a fun activity you could
complete:

             please:

(1) fill a cup with water
(2) pour that glass of water over a part of your
body(your choice which body part)
          YOU ARE NOW A WATER MODEL
(3) write down:
  (a) your location in the the world
  (b) what part of the body you poured the water
over
  (c) how you looked as a water model
  (d) how you felt as a water model.

(4) send me your responses (backchannel or to the list)

thanks for all your help,
Francis Raven

I'm touched but slightly baffled -- to be honest, however good or bad my
poetry might be, technically innovative it aint.

The consensus would be that linguistically you're a damn site more
innovative than me.

Possibly it helps to be a Brummie illiterate.

steve,

you should really reply to the editors about this, not the poetics list.
also, you should know that many, if not most, editors wait until the end of
a submission period to decide what work they're going to accept, so as not
to accept inferior work early on and then have to refuse better work because
of page constraints. the pom editors stated their deadline is aug. 31.

best,
david

Greetings: I recently attended the wonderful Scream Literary Fest event in
High Park in downtown Toronto.  While there I interviewed Vancouver poet
Jordan Scott about his explorations with "avant garde nature poetry" and
the poetics of stuttering.  He also reads a few illustrative poems.

You can hear Jordan's interview (it's about 10 mins long) by clicking on
"Charlie Says" on the homepage of www.poetrypoetry.com or you can listen
to Poety World Radio and it will eventually come around as part of the
mix. . . till we get the radio more developed and with its own website
with a schedule, the former approach is recommended.

and...we're still looking for cd's of poetry for Poetry World Radio.

Well Trevor your ad hoc list is a monument to tedium, you begin with Mairead
Byrne , who writes drivel, then we have Randolph Healy who is an example to
us all why maths teachers shouldn't pretend to be poets, then you have Billy
Little who lives up to his surname. Phew!

Hi Nate person with an address. What's this about me being inobservant? Now
it's quite true that I do have bad eyesight but it seems to me that your
post consists of a snidey remark without substance that is typical of the
school that you inhabit. I do have reason for aggreviance, to my knowledge
you are not a poet yourself, I AM, and I get very bored with vampires, all
they can talk about is the boxes they not-live in.

Best

Point accepted Nate, I do have bad eyesight. BUT there are issues in this
non-discussion wailing to be heard. What I notice about the Irish
self-proclaimed avant-garde is that they present themselves a collective
entity that is predicated and justified on their being innovative or the
like, it hangs around a very few key words. They do not say here am I a
flawed and vulnerable human being who is trying to push the edge in verse to
you, no, they say we belong to a group. So one finds oneself reading
Trevor's drones or Mairead's drivel while secretly thinking that Heaney or
Muldoon are actually better poets. What comes across to me from their work
is a desire for acceptance, a tedious wish for imposing conformity that
hides from the scares of openly being human.

Take care, I do think you are a good annotator you know

Best

Dave

In haste.

I would heartily agree with David that Heaney and Muldoon are very fine
poets.

However, I disagree with some of the other opinions he's expressed and would
consider
the poetry of Mairead Byrne, Trevor Joyce, Geoffrey Squires, Billy Mills,
Catherine Walsh,
Maurice Scully, David Lloyd, among the others mentioned, to be excellent.
(And thanks Gary for the thumbs up.) .

As Trevor pointed out, I have in past suspended David from a listserv. I was
new to the game than, and have never been happy with that decision. The line
between robust humour and something else can be very difficult to determine.
Sorry, David. I wasn't up to making such close calls.

It does seem to me though, that Mary Jo's post was unfair and unacceptable.
There is still the possibility of a discussion. Don't kill it off like that.

Ona positive note, as a balance to the tone-stripping effect of e-mail,
those who would like to hear an illiterate brummie and his mates in full
flow can click

http://www.wildhoneypress.com/voices/voicelist.html

It might be a little slow in starting, but these three, David Bircumshaw,
Robin Hamilton and Dominic Fox are worth waiting for. (And the others are
great too!)

I am very disappointed in POETICLIST.
I am a poor Korean writer suffering a deadly Korean environment.
After barely solving the translation barrier, I sent the message with
my homepage www.xqqqx.com
where my texts are.
But getting no reply makes me so sad.

I just want to communicate with people who love expermental
literature, since there is nobody in Korea.

Dear Poor Korean writer;
ok, i like "The Theory of the Moving-stairs"  and esp. enamoured of
the phrase/image ' The bugs are holding the broken slices of stone in

and "Timeless Age" seems to be an invigorating ocean of reading!

Let's not forget Simon Cutts.

Jonathan Williams has his address in Ireland.

He has some fantastic books of experimental poetry, for instance
A SMELL OF PRINTING (Granary Books)
_http://www.granarybooks.com/books/smell_of_printing/smell_of_printing1.html_
(http://www.granarybooks.com/books/smell_of_printing/smell_of_printing1.html)

_http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=0912330686_
(http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=0912330686)

(and my favorite) PIANO STOOL FOOTNOTES
_http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=SIMON+CUTTS&y=13&tn=PIAN
O+STOOL&x=72_
(http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=SIMON+CUTTS&y=13&tn=PIANO+STOOL&x=72)

Was just looking for a photograph of Simon Cutts on the Jargon  Webpage,
because I know I've seen one there, but can't find it now, but wanted  to
share this amazing page!  Take a look at photographs of,
Niedecker, Loy, Levertov, Sandra Fisher, Thomas Meyer, and David  Hockney

Uh Ak, I think you are an AWESOME poet.  I'm glad you complained
because otherwise I might not have noticed your poems.

I'm an English teacher and I have a lot of Korean students.  They
seem to be having a good time in New York.  Why not come and check it
out here if Korea is such a deadly drag?

Interesting that the premiere web artist of today is a Korean in Seoul who
translates her works into faultless English, Japanese, Spanish, Japanese,
French and German but this person at xqqqx.com can't even get English verb
tenses right.  I suppose "Uh Ak" (or "Ak Uh") is a Jack Spicer fan also?

Yes, Simon has produced some beautiful books, including work by Susan =20=

borders. We have seen the battlefields on our Televisions and in the
Newspapers.=20

So now, the ALP and the LIB-NAT coalition agree on the ID card. One can
assume that within twelve months we who have tax file numbers, or social
security cards, or medicare cards, or drivers' licenses, or passports, =
or
bank debt, or criminal records, or communicable diseases, or electoral
enrolment, will have all our data neatly stored and accessible via one =
ID
card.=20

At Griffith, in the School of Bio-Art, we have gone one step further. =
During
the first week of first Semester all the first year students enrolled in =
our
School's degree programs were systematically laser tatooed. The wrist =
tatoo,
visible only under black ultra-violet light and like the magnetic strip =
of
an ID card can be 'loaded' with information. The data or information can
then be retrieved by use of a data reader or scanner.

All kinds of information has been loaded to date; student numbers, home
addresses, aus-study details; hecs details; personal course timetables;
details of enrolment; email account details; academic record; medical
information, allergies, medications, blood type, organ donor status, =
etc;
computer lab log-in details, usernames and passwords; library =
priveleges;
building access and restrictions; car park entry; photocopying accounts; =
all
linked by a central financial status account and management system.

Of course this has been very expensive initially. We could not have =
achieved
this without the financial backing of the company that supplies the =
laser
tatooing and data loading super-computers. Our biggest expense really =
was
fitting data readers. We had to install data readers on every locked =
door
and boom-gate in the School; on every computer in all the Teaching and
common use laboratories; in the library and at Student Administration. =
Our
'smart' building now knows who to allow to park their car in the car =
park,
which lecture theatre, tutorial room or computer lab to allow access to =
and
at what times they are allowed access. At the same time as offering =
maximum
flexibility and keyless entry the building is totally secure and =
protected
from non-authorised persons. All equipment, videos, computers, =
projectors
etc have been laser tatooed also and their movement and location =
detected.
Teachers no longer mark rolls or check attendances, it is all logged for
them by DataCentral, accessible via the secured University website.

Students can choose to purchase or lease additional peripheral devices =
like
strap-on wireless readers which allow them to connect their data tatoo =
to
their mobile phone for refreshing data and uploads. Students can also =
use
their wrist-reader to download from their directories at DataCentral =
(exam
results, reminders, fee due dates, etc.) Uptake of the wrist-readers has
been slow but we expect will increase as more commercial and community
services come on board; banks, supermarkets, department stores, record
shops, fashion houses etc.. There are so many potential applications of =
this
data co-ordination system.

If Mr Howard and Mr Beattie are serious about introducing the ID card =
for
security reasons, they should seriously consider the benefits of the =
laser
tattoo and the wearable data reader. Our next project is to make the =
mobile
phone a wearable item, consolidating the dial-pad onto the wrist-reader =
and
implanting a small microphone into a tooth, and a small earphone into =
the
ear like an earring. This will have the added security benefit of being =
able
to find the wearer at any time via the phone's Global Positioning System
technology, even if the phone is not being used. Whilst cards seem to be =
a
cheaper option, the laser tattoos are something that you can not be
separated from, your identity remains on your person at all times. Or =
does
it? Consider who the real terrorists are here.

Trevor Joyce has provided a useful list of Irish poets and poets with
Irish connections. Not surprising, since Joyce is a central figure
not only in supporting new poetry in Ireland but also connecting
poets in Ireland to those with whom they have affinities in the UK
and US. It is a good thing that Joyce, Maurice Scully, Randolph
Healey, and others, have worked so hard to create these connections,
since Irish poets working outside the convenient and narrow markers
of dominant styles have a hard time getting their work known in their
own country and beyond -- and for that matter finding each other.

When I was in Cork recently for the SoundEye poetry festival, it was
a pleasure to reconnect with Catherine Walsh, whom we had invited to
Buffalo in the early 90s and who remains a favorite poet of mine. I
highly recommend her books -- Short Stories, Pitch, and Eatortha &
Making Tents. (Walsh co-edits hardPressed Poetry press with her
husband, the poet Billy Mills: http://gofree.indigo.ie/~hpp/frame.html.)

The good news I heard at Cork is that Wild Honey Press is going to be
doing a new, large collection of Walsh's work. This will add to the
already substantial set of books published by Randolph Healey at Wild
Honey. Healey's work with Wild Honey is a classic case of a poet with
very limited support managing to do major cultural work. The Wild
Honey website is at http://www.wildhoneypress.com/

I would also recommend Healey's 2002 collection from Salt Publishing,
Green 532 -- about which I wrote a few words at the time of
publication -- **If poetry can sometimes be the right thing for the
right reason, then Randolph Healey's Green 532 has all les mots
justes -- just notes -- to shake the tale loose from the tribe and
dance with it. Lurking, like a lark, somewhere between "reflection
and shadow", these poems are cosmological forays into the "fragile,
transitory, precarious" uncertainty that underlies our ability to respond.**

I first encountered the work of Geoffrey Squires at his Cork reading.
I immediately picked up his collection from Wild Honey -- Untitled
and Other Poems 1975-2002. The line that first caught my ear was "a
deep immobility even in things that can be moved"  but then, quick
upon: "liquidity of noise that one almost see" &  "the broken
refracted light". These spare yet somehow lushly dark,
epistemologically searching poems suggested, at first, a fusion of
William Bronk and Merrill Gilfillan. The lines noted are from
Landscape & Silences (originally published by Dublin's New Writers'
Press in  1996), in which Squires creates a poem that distends time;
that is, slows it down so much that it thickens in the ear. Reading
further, I am stuck by Squires's uncanny ability to use the lyric as
fault line for the intersection of perception and consciousness. Also
to note: most of his poems are serial (in the sense of Oppen's
Discrete Series); seriality in this work is linked both to Squire's
immanent ecopoetics and suffused phenomenology.

Trevor's Joyce's list of Irish and Irish related poets posted to Poetics is at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0507&L=poetics&D=1&O=D&F=&S=&P=24372

& indeed, CA Conrad is right -- Simon Cutts is a terrific book
artist; his "Vinyl" show was the backdrop to the SoundEye Festival.

And - according to the NY Times - the Nominee for U.S. Supreme Court Justic=
e
is:

John G. Roberts Jr.
From dKosopedia, the free political encyclopedia.

(his record is on lower half of this doc, if you want to jump to this
conservative's grit - i.e. If you are not of his persuasion, time to reach
for the pocket book. This one will take the "tilt" out of O'Connor's "swing=
"
and give Court ownership to the Right).
=20
John G. Roberts Jr. (born in Buffalo, New York, 1955) is a judge on the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, having been
nominated by President George W. Bush on May 9, 2001, and confirmed by the
United States Senate on May 8, 2003.

Roberts graduated from Harvard College in 1976. Roberts receivied his Juris
Doctorate from the Harvard Law School in 1979.

He was a law clerk for Henry Friendly, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, 1979-1980, and for Associate Justice William Rehnquist, Supreme
Court of the United States, 1980-1981. He then took a job as special
assistant to William French Smith, the attorney general, U.S. Department of
Justice, 1981-1982, before being appointed associate counsel to President
Ronald Reagan, White House Counsel's Office, 1982-1986.

He entered private practice in 1986 as an associate at the Washington D.C.
law firm of Hogan & Hartson, but left to serve from 1989-1993 as Principal
Deputy Solicitor General, U.S. Department of Justice. He returned to Hogan
and Harston in 1993 as a partner where he remained until he was appointed t=
o
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In private practice and
as Principal Deputy Solicitor General he has argued more than 30 cases in
front of the United States Supreme Court.

Roberts has been mentioned frequently as being near the top of the list of
potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States, should one of
the current justices leave the Court during George W. Bush's presidency.

Judicial outlook and record

Roberts has been floated as a nominee who could win widespread support in
the Senate. Not so likely. He hasn't been on the bench long enough for his
judicial opinions to provide much ammunition for liberal opposition groups.
But his record as a lawyer for the Reagan and first Bush administrations an=
d
in private practice is down-the-line conservative on key contested fronts,
including abortion, separation of church and state, and environmental
protection.=20


Civil Rights and Liberties
For a unanimous panel, denied the weak civil rights claims of a 12-year-old
girl who was arrested and handcuffed in a Washington, D.C., Metro station
for eating a French fry. Roberts noted that "no one is very happy about the
events that led to this litigation" and that the Metro authority had change=
d
the policy that led to her arrest. (Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority, 2004).

In private practice, wrote a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that Congres=
s
had failed to justify a Department of Transportation affirmative action
program. (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 2001).

For Reagan, opposed a congressional effort=8Bin the wake of the 1980 Supreme
Court decision Mobile v. Bolden=8Bto make it easier for minorities to
successfully argue that their votes had been diluted under the Voting Right=
s
Act.=20


Separation of Church and State
For Bush I, co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that public
high-school graduation programs could include religious ceremonies. The
Supreme Court disagreed by a vote of 5-4. (Lee v. Weisman, 1992)


Environmental Protection and Property Rights
Voted for rehearing in a case about whether a developer had to take down a
fence so that the arroyo toad could move freely through its habitat. Robert=
s
argued that the panel was wrong to rule against the developer because the
regulations on behalf of the toad, promulgated under the Endangered Species
Act, overstepped the federal government's power to regulate interstate
commerce. At the end of his opinion, Roberts suggested that rehearing would
allow the court to "consider alternative grounds" for protecting the toad
that are "more consistent with Supreme Court precedent." (Rancho Viejo v.
Nortion, 2003)=20

For Bush I, argued that environmental groups concerned about mining on
public lands had not proved enough about the impact of the government's
actions to give them standing to sue. The Supreme Court adopted this
argument. (Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 1990)


Criminal Law=20
Joined a unanimous opinion ruling that a police officer who searched the
trunk of a car without saying that he was looking for evidence of a crime
(the standard for constitutionality) still conducted the search legally,
because there was a reasonable basis to think contraband was in the trunk,
regardless of whether the officer was thinking in those terms. (U.S. v.
Brown, 2004)=20


Habeas Corpus=20
Joined a unanimous opinion denying the claim of a prisoner who argued that
by tightening parole rules in the middle of his sentence, the government
subjected him to an unconstitutional after-the-fact punishment. The panel
reversed its decision after a Supreme Court ruling directly contradicted it=
.
(Fletcher v. District of Columbia, 2004)


Abortion=20
For Bush I, successfully helped argue that doctors and clinics receiving
federal funds may not talk to patients about abortion. (Rust v. Sullivan,
1991)=20


Judicial Philosophy
Concurring in a decision allowing President Bush to halt suits by Americans
against Iraq as the country rebuilds, Roberts called for deference to the
executive and for a literal reading of the relevant statute. (Acree v.
Republic of Iraq, 2004)

In an article written as a law student, argued that the phrase "just
compensation" in the Fifth Amendment, which limits the government in the
taking of private property, should be "informed by changing norms of
justice." This sounds like a nod to liberal constitutional theory, but
Rogers' alternative interpretation was more protective of property interest=
s
than Supreme Court law at the time.

It is sometimes hard to get the news from Poetics-list these days.

In addition to what Randolph refers to as the "tone-stripping effect of
e-mail," it might be helpful to consider that not all readers of and
contributors to this list are constantly following all the threads--mine is,
I admit, a quite inconstant presence--and thus not always keyed into the
particular, interpersonal dynamics structuring (or perhaps explaining) some
of the rhetoric.

I very much enjoyed Trevor's "drone" when he read at our house in Buffalo a
couple of years back: especially the tour de force poem "Syzygy," from the
collection _With the First Dream of Fire They Hunt the Cold_.  This
nine-page work synthesizes and permutates medieval form (the palindromic
cancrizans), serial composition, astronomy, Scottish salmon "superstition,"
local fishing economy (and geology and architecture), Swedish folklore,
imperial Chinese and British surveying, surrealism (in a great line from
Neruda:"the red noise of bones"), the symbolic anthropology of Mary Douglas,
Irish Song Tradition, and language from the financial times.

For its feat of combinatorial "form" alone, the piece is worth a study.  But
it also is a serial exploration of the ambiguities of identity, whose global
reach richly calls into question precisely the kinds of labelings and group
identifications/ exclusions Trevor's name seems to have become a magnet for
on this list:

"the quickening across these settlements disturbs what wind" . . .

Also of note: the distilled filial Joycean block (14 pages, single spaced,
all caps) that is Trevor's "Stillsman" (published in 2003 in a chapbook,
_Undone, Say_, by the indefatigable Nate Doward--who does a *lot* more than
annotate anthologies: CHECK OUT his very constant and focused _The Gig_,
esp. the recent _Entanglement_s of Allen Fisher:
http://www.ndorward.com/poetry/ ).

I also was delighted and surprised by Mairead Byrne's readings, during some
"open mike" sessions hosted by Bill Howe at the University of Maine at
Orono's 1940s Conference last summer.  Crisp, original stuff!  My only
complaint about her performances was that they ended too soon . . .  I am
looking forward to seeing her new chapbook, _An Educated Heart_, just out
from Palm Press: http://www.palmpress.org/

Thus I was eager, when I saw the subject heading, to learn more about "Irish
Experimental Poets," only to become distressed at some of the content of
yesterday's posts.  Not that I mind a bit of sharpness here and there, but
this seemed pretty flamey!

In retrospect, I now realize that it may have been little more than hearty
back-slapping between old friends.  But how would those of us not "in on the
conversation" know?

Then again, perhaps it was provocation, intended to draw out exactly this
sort of discussion.  Which then becomes more of a reflection on list-lurkers
like me . . .

Tidy that this comes just in time to get us off
the Spiral Rovie.

My concern is: It's just that. Leave the summer
for one and all to scorch the earth, making  fall-
guy Roberts (and the Democrats) into nothing
more than a grease stain, whilst getting all minds
off Rove, and all the while lining up the October
souffle... a secondary stealth judicial nomination.

Just the same though, I thank you with promptly
rming with J. G. R.'s record!

Gerald S.

And - according to the NY Times - the Nominee for U.S. Supreme Court Justice
is:

John G. Roberts Jr.
From dKosopedia, the free political encyclopedia.

(his record is on lower half of this doc, if you want to jump to this
conservative's grit - i.e. If you are not of his persuasion, time to reach
for the pocket book. This one will take the "tilt" out of O'Connor's "swing"
and give Court ownership to the Right).

John G. Roberts Jr. (born in Buffalo, New York, 1955) is a judge on the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, having been
nominated by President George W. Bush on May 9, 2001, and confirmed by the
United States Senate on May 8, 2003.

Roberts graduated from Harvard College in 1976. Roberts receivied his Juris
Doctorate from the Harvard Law School in 1979.

He was a law clerk for Henry Friendly, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, 1979-1980, and for Associate Justice William Rehnquist, Supreme
Court of the United States, 1980-1981. He then took a job as special
assistant to William French Smith, the attorney general, U.S. Department of
Justice, 1981-1982, before being appointed associate counsel to President
Ronald Reagan, White House Counsel's Office, 1982-1986.

He entered private practice in 1986 as an associate at the Washington D.C.
law firm of Hogan & Hartson, but left to serve from 1989-1993 as Principal
Deputy Solicitor General, U.S. Department of Justice. He returned to Hogan
and Harston in 1993 as a partner where he remained until he was appointed to
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In private practice and
as Principal Deputy Solicitor General he has argued more than 30 cases in
front of the United States Supreme Court.

Roberts has been mentioned frequently as being near the top of the list of
potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States, should one of
the current justices leave the Court during George W. Bush's presidency.

Judicial outlook and record

Roberts has been floated as a nominee who could win widespread support in
the Senate. Not so likely. He hasn't been on the bench long enough for his
judicial opinions to provide much ammunition for liberal opposition groups.
But his record as a lawyer for the Reagan and first Bush administrations and
in private practice is down-the-line conservative on key contested fronts,
including abortion, separation of church and state, and environmental
protection.


Civil Rights and Liberties
For a unanimous panel, denied the weak civil rights claims of a 12-year-old
girl who was arrested and handcuffed in a Washington, D.C., Metro station
for eating a French fry. Roberts noted that "no one is very happy about the
events that led to this litigation" and that the Metro authority had changed
the policy that led to her arrest. (Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority, 2004).

In private practice, wrote a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that Congress
had failed to justify a Department of Transportation affirmative action
program. (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 2001).

For Reagan, opposed a congressional effort Court decision Mobile v. Bolden
successfully argue that their votes had been diluted under the Voting Rights
Act.


Separation of Church and State
For Bush I, co-authored a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that public
high-school graduation programs could include religious ceremonies. The
Supreme Court disagreed by a vote of 5-4. (Lee v. Weisman, 1992)


Environmental Protection and Property Rights
Voted for rehearing in a case about whether a developer had to take down a
fence so that the arroyo toad could move freely through its habitat. Roberts
argued that the panel was wrong to rule against the developer because the
regulations on behalf of the toad, promulgated under the Endangered Species
Act, overstepped the federal government's power to regulate interstate
commerce. At the end of his opinion, Roberts suggested that rehearing would
allow the court to "consider alternative grounds" for protecting the toad
that are "more consistent with Supreme Court precedent." (Rancho Viejo v.
Nortion, 2003)

For Bush I, argued that environmental groups concerned about mining on
public lands had not proved enough about the impact of the government's
actions to give them standing to sue. The Supreme Court adopted this
argument. (Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 1990)


Criminal Law
Joined a unanimous opinion ruling that a police officer who searched the
trunk of a car without saying that he was looking for evidence of a crime
(the standard for constitutionality) still conducted the search legally,
because there was a reasonable basis to think contraband was in the trunk,
regardless of whether the officer was thinking in those terms. (U.S. v.
Brown, 2004)


Habeas Corpus
Joined a unanimous opinion denying the claim of a prisoner who argued that
by tightening parole rules in the middle of his sentence, the government
subjected him to an unconstitutional after-the-fact punishment. The panel
reversed its decision after a Supreme Court ruling directly contradicted it.
(Fletcher v. District of Columbia, 2004)


Abortion
For Bush I, successfully helped argue that doctors and clinics receiving
federal funds may not talk to patients about abortion. (Rust v. Sullivan,
1991)


Judicial Philosophy
Concurring in a decision allowing President Bush to halt suits by Americans
against Iraq as the country rebuilds, Roberts called for deference to the
executive and for a literal reading of the relevant statute. (Acree v.
Republic of Iraq, 2004)

In an article written as a law student, argued that the phrase "just
compensation" in the Fifth Amendment, which limits the government in the
taking of private property, should be "informed by changing norms of
justice." This sounds like a nod to liberal constitutional theory, but
Rogers' alternative interpretation was more protective of property interests
than Supreme Court law at the time.

OMAN: HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST HELD BY POLICE
http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=3DSecurity&loid=3D8.0.187249254=
&pa
r=3D0

Muscat, 14 July (AKI) - A leading human rights activist in Oman, who
worked=20
to publicise the recent trial of 31 Islamists, is being held for=20
questioning, one of his associates said. Abdullah Al-Ryami is said to
have=20
been summoned by police on Tuesday and has not been seen since.
Diplomats=20
say they are checking the reports. Al-Ryami was very active in drawing=20
attention to the trial of the Islamists, who were convicted of plotting
to=20
overthrow the Omani government, but later pardoned and freed by the=20
country's leader Qaboos bin Said al-Said.

The Islamists were jailed in May for between one and 20 years by Oman's=20
state security court for plotting to "overthrow the regime by force of
arms=20
and replace it with a clerical regime, by setting up a banned
underground=20
organisation." They were also found guilty of holding recruitment
sessions,=20
carrying out military training and arming members with illegally
obtained=20
weapons."

Following the conviction hundreds of people marched through the Omani=20
capital Muscat calling for the Islamists to be acquitted. Their lawyers=20
insisted they were innocent, and had simply been trying to promote the=20
teachings of the Ibadi sect of Islam, which the majority of Omanis
follow.



Taiba Al Ma'wali sentenced to jail

http://www.omanforum.com/threads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/239231/an/0/p

A huge precedent was set in Oman today. Taiba Al Ma'wali, one of the
first=20
female members of Majlis Al Shura, was sentenced to a year and half in
jail=20
for comments she made regarding the arrests and trials earlier this
year.

I am surprised that no one ever mentioned her trial here on OmanForum
before=20
nor the verdict which was announced today. Apparently the news has
already=20
been carried in some news channels.

Re: Taiba Al Ma'wali sentenced to jail
#239241 - 07/13/05 09:45 PM

I have no details beyond what was written on Sablat Al Arab=20
(www.omania.net/avb/showthread.php?t=3D180557&page=3D1&pp=3D50 for =
details in=20
Arabic). By the way the guy who wrote all the details on the case,
Abdullah=20
Al Riyami, Oman's only human rights activist, has himself been taken in
by=20
the police since yesterday. He was called in to come answer some
questions=20
and hasn't left since.

From what I read on that website she's accused of the following:

Criticising the public prosecutor's statement by saying that they are
slaves=20
to authority.

Criticising the statement made by H.E. Ali Majid Al Mamari, head of the=20
royal office, which he made regarding the arrests. This is supposedly=20
something she wrote online.

Criticising the head of the police in a personal telephone
conversations.

Criticising Majlis Al Shura's statement regarding the trial of
detainees.

Criticising HH Sayid Ass'ad bin Tariq, also in a non-official telephone=20
conversation.

Criticising Najiah Al Ma'wali, deputy head of the equistrian society, in
the=20
same telephone conversation as above.

Btw, Sayyid Ass'ad later made a statement indicating that he has not
pressed=20
charges against her nor does he hold anything she says against him.

Taiba was an observer in the trial of the 31 detainees last May.
Apparently=20
after the trial she sent an SMS to someone saying that the trial wasn't=20
fair. This was recorded against her and presented in the trial.

Be careful what you write in SMS, guys.. everything's recorded.



Poet and journalist Abdallah Al-Ryami jailed for criticising human
rights=20
violations
http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3D14406

15 Jul 05 | Reporters Without Borders today condemned the arrest on 12
July=20
of poet and journalist Abdallah Al-Ryami for criticising human rights=20
violations in Oman, and deplored the strict censorship of writers and=20
journalists which the Omani authorities have been enforcing for the past
few=20
months.
"We call on the sultanate's government to free Al-Ryami at once and to=20
respect the 1995 Alma-Ata declaration in which it undertook to adopt
laws=20
guaranteeing the rights to freedom of expression and opinion, access to=20
information and press freedom," the organisation said.

Amendment of the press laws, which allow the authorities to exercise=20
systematic control of all means of expression, is also necessary,
Reporters=20
Without Borders said.

Al Ryami had been harassed by the authorities ever since he was invited
to=20
take part in a televised debate about democratic reforms in July 2004,
and=20
voiced doubt about the government's readiness to undertake real
democratic=20
reforms. The authorities immediately gave verbal instructions to
newspaper=20
editors and the state radio and TV broadcaster's executives forbidding
them=20
to interview Al Ryami or even mention his name or his works.

A published poet and playwright, Al-Ryami often used to take part in
arts=20
and culture programmes on Omani television. Since he spoke out on
Al-Alam,=20
his TV programmes had been withdrawn but he continued to write for
various=20
websites such as www.kikah.com, an independent online magazine dedicated
to=20
arts and culture.



Oman media ordered to blacklist writers
http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3D11922

24 Nov 04 | Reporters Without Borders lambasted the Sultanate of Oman
for=20
banning the media from giving space or airtime to two writers and=20
intellectuals for the past five months and called for them to be allowed
to=20
be interviewed freely again.

The blacklisting appears to be linked to comments the two made on the=20
Iranian channel Al-Alam casting doubt on government commitment to
political=20
reform.

Writer Mohammed Al-Harthi has had his weekly column banned from the
official=20
daily Oman. Poet Abdullah Al-Ryami, has seen his once frequent
appearances=20
on state-run national television cancelled one after the other.

Both Al-Harthi and Al-Ryami believe that the Oman authorities probably
gave=20
verbal instructions to editors of newspapers and directors of programmes
on=20
public radio and television forbidding them to interview the two=20
intellectuals or even to mention their names or their work.

Contacted by Reporters Without Borders, the information ministry refused
to=20
explain the measure, limiting itself to citing various minor amendments
made=20
to the press law in August 2004.

The worldwide press freedom organisation condemned the attitude of the
Oman=20
authorities in ruling what subjects are "lawful" and "unlawful" and
which=20
guests can or cannot be invited on to the airwaves. In a democratic
country,=20
journalists make this choice.

The organisation urged Oman to allow the national media the freedom to=20
interview the two to prove that political modernisation is under way in
the=20
Sultanate. Political opening should include respect for a free and=20
independent press and reform of the still very harsh press law, it said.
Reporters Without Borders urged the Sultanate of Oman, a UNESCO member
since=20
10 February 1972, to respect the 1995 Alma-Ata declaration, in which it=20
undertook to pass legislation "establishing freedom of expression and=20
opinion, access to information and press freedom" and to "end monopolies
and=20
all forms of discrimination in radio broadcasting".

The two intellectuals told Reporters Without Borders by phone that the
press=20
code was "obsolete" and condemned the authorities' systematic control of
all=20
means of expression.

Al-Harthi said the Oman press law, which has not been reformed since
1984,=20
gave the information ministry the power to try and jail journalists
without=20
having to explain itself to anyone. Al-Ryami said the authorities
"attached=20
no importance to press freedom and continued to crackdown on any
opinions=20
differing from the government's. Every means of expression including the

Internet were subjected to censorship.

TV channel Al-Alam put out two programmes in July 2004 on the subject of

democratic reform in the Sultanate. Several members of the State Council

(Majlis Al-Dawla) and the Consultative Assembly (Majlis Al-Shura) due to

take part in the first programme on 7 July, pulled out at the last
moment. During the programme, Mohammed Al-Harthi and Abdullah Al-Ryami
both=20
expressed their doubts about the government's willingness to start
genuine=20
democratic reform.

A week later, Oman television refused to let its studios to Al-Alam and
most=20
of the leading Oman figures due to take part again pulled out. The
second=20
programme was finally broadcast from Beirut and Al-Ryami and Al-Harthi=20
contributed by telephone.

Al-Harthi had a weekly cultural column entitled Charafat (Platforms) in
the=20
daily Oman. He has published several books and collections of poems,
some of=20
which are banned in Oman.

Al Ryami is a theatre director and has published literary works and=20
collections of poems. His works used to be broadcasted on Oman radio and

television. Since making his comments on Al-Alam, his poems and theatre=20
works have been taken off the programme schedule in Oman radio,

and daily newspapers. Lately presenters who invited him to take part in=20
special programmes linked to Ramadam, were reminded by their management

--The incommunicado detention of a prominent playwright and human rights

activist in Oman exposes the country's weak legal protections and due=20
process provisions, Human Rights Watch said today. 'Abdullah Ryami has
not=20
spoken with family or legal counsel since presenting himself for=20
interrogation at the Special Section of the Omani Royal Police
Headquarters=20
in the capital Muscat on July 12.

The Omani activist's family said that they have not heard from him and
have=20
been unable to obtain information about his condition and his
whereabouts=20
from the police. The police have denied 'Abdullah Ryami's family the=20
opportunity to hire a lawyer for him.

"The Omani authorities should immediately inform 'Abdullah Ryami's
family of=20
his whereabouts," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human

Rights Watch. "They must release him or charge him with a crime, and
must=20
respect his rights to an attorney and for his family members to visit
him."

Ryami had vocally criticized the Omani government's arrests, starting in

December, and the eventual trial of 31 Omanis of the 'Ibadi faith on
charges=20
of plotting a coup. At the time, Ryami told Gulf News that "[t]here is
no=20
information about the detainees, and even their family members are
unaware=20
of their whereabouts." The State Security Court convicted the men on May
2=20
and sentenced them to prison terms of between one and twenty years on=20
charges that ranged from weapons possession to leading a conspiracy to=20
overthrow the government.

In addition, Ryami publicized what he described as excessive use of
force by=20
the Omani police against what witnesses described to Human Rights Watch
as a=20
peaceful demonstration protesting the conviction of the 31 'Ibadis.
Ryami=20
described how the police trapped demonstrators inside the Sa'id Ibn
Taimur=20
Mosque in Muscat and beat those who tried to escape with batons. Mr.
Ryami=20
continuously monitored the trial of 24 of the demonstrators before the
State=20
Security Court.

In May and June, Ryami also publicized the government's prosecution of=20
former parliamentarian and journalist, Tayba Ma'wali, whom the
government=20
charged with insulting public officials via telephone and internet.
Omani=20
officials demanded that Ryami present himself for interrogation two days

before the court issued its verdict against Ma'wali on July 13.

Sultan Qaboos of Oman on June 9 pardoned the convicted plotters and=20

Call for Submissions and Nominations


In 2006, Firewheel Editions will publish An Introduction to the Prose Poem =
[tentative title], a short anthology of prose poems with a pedagogical=20
framework. The book is designed for use in the creative writing or=20
freshman/sophomore lit classroom and is organized around common strategies =

of composition: the epistolary poem, the abecedarian poem, the list poem,=20
rants, fables, parables, the object poem, the sound poem, etc. The book=20
will also include a section of prose poems that are not easy to classify=20
under any particular common strategy.=20

A version of the book will be published simultaneously as 100 Contemporary =
Prose Poems by Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press. Some poems will a=
ppear in=20
both books, but each book will have poems that do not appear in the other. =

The Shanghai book will serve as an introduction to the international prose =

poem tradition, but it is also designed to help non-native speakers study=20
contemporary literature in English.

Firewheel Editions seeks submissions and nominations of prose poems for=20
both books. Please follow these guidelines:

*Send 1-5 prose poems. It is unlikely that more than one poem from any=20
poet will be chosen for either individual volume.

*If a poem recognizably employs any of the above compositional strategies=20
(or other common strategies), please identify/describe the strategy and=20
accompany the poem with a brief (up to 150 words) author's statement about =

the utility of that strategy, the process used, the decision to follow=20
that strategy, the evolution of the poem, or any other comments that might =

be useful to students.

* Send the poems in HARD COPY ONLY (no electronic submissions) to=20
Firewheel Editions, Box 7, Western Connecticut State University, 181 White =

St., Danbury, CT 06810. Submissions must be received no later than=20
September 1, 2005. Please be sure to include an SASE or email address for=20
response. If your work is selected, Firewheel Editions will request an=20
electronic copy in September.  Poems published previously in journals and=20
magazines are acceptable, if the author holds the right to reprint (please =

identify place of original publication so that we may acknowledge). Poems=20
that have appeared in books must be accompanied by a letter from the book=20
publisher granting Firewheel Editions the right to reprint the poem in=20
either or both of the two books with no permission fee.

Both books will appear in mid-late 2006. Contributors will receive a copy=20
of each book in which their work appears.

Location: Stanford, CA

The Program Assistant is a full-time position for an 11-month fixed term
(8/16/05 to 7/15/06, renewable), reporting to the Program Administrator
and serving the Director, faculty, and students of the Stanford Creative
Writing Program, generally considered the top writing program in the
country. The program is part of the English Department and consists of
20 Stegner graduate fellows, 7 lecturers, and 7 English faculty along
with more than 50 undergraduate students pursuing a Creative Writing
minor or an English major with a creative writing emphasis. The program
has an active schedule of literary events, including presentations by
prominent visiting authors and regular readings by program faculty,
Stegner fellows, and students. The program also sponsors special
visiting professorships in fiction and poetry on an annual basis.

Information, office services, and events are the principal areas of
focus for the Program Assistant. The Assistant serves as a receptionist,
providing telephone, electronic, and in-person information to the public
and the university community as well as responding to application
requests (about 3,500 annually) for the Stegner fellowships. The
Assistant is responsible for the basic functionality of the program
office (e.g., mail, deliveries, copying, filing, supplies, equipment,
facilities, computer support); for routine correspondence; and for
payments using petty cash, the purchasing card, and the Oracle
requisition system. The Assistant handles textbook orders, teaching
evaluations, and other support for courses and tutorials, including
maintaining up-to-date information on schedules, locations, instructors,
and requirements for the creative writing emphasis and the minor. The
Assistant manages the selection process for undergraduate writing prizes
and assists in the Stegner admissions process. Following direction from
the Program Administrator, the Assistant implements event plans, to
include reserving venues, arranging catering, issuing invitations,
handling publicity, ordering specialized services, and performing any
other tasks, as necessary.


Qualifications:

Well-developed skills in dealing with the public and in responding to
the wide-ranging needs of the program's constituency are of central
importance. Must be able to communicate effectively and in many formats
with students, faculty, and administrators. Must be tactful,
good-humored, even-tempered and flexible; must be able to work
cooperatively with others as well as independently without close
supervision; must be able to exercise sound judgment and to handle
sensitive information with discretion. Requires excellent organizational
skills and ability to work on multiple tasks efficiently and under
pressure. Proficiency in email communication a necessity as well as
experience with software for word-processing and spreadsheets and for
creating and managing Web sites and databases. Experience with Stanford
systems a plus. Some exposure to an office environment and its related
procedures and equipment is required. College education preferred, a
B.A. desired. Strong skills in writing, proofing, and attention to
detail are needed along with an interest in the activities of the
literary community. Requires a 40-hour work week and the flexibility to
work some evenings, as required by event schedules.

I've been grateful for the journalism Ron Silliman has
been finding and transmitting to us lately, as he has
so often in the past...the two pieces on the Olson
documentary that's being developed (one article had
truly illuminating quotes from Gloucester Olsonites),
the piece on Snyder, and now the Philadelphia Inquirer
on _Shadowtime_ (being performed tonight AND FRIDAY,
if I'm reading my calendar correctly).  But I'm sure
more than just two of us (hi, Mary Jo!) would like to
know WHAT Ron finds askew when he calls an article
"curious"...as he did in introducing both the Snyder
and the Bernstein clippings.  No big deal, just
curious. :)

"Curious" is the way the Sheriff raises his eyebrow when passing by a
brothel - half wanting to be on the inside, and half disapproving.

Some day there will be a major review of the entire work and life of Ron
Silliman in the New York Times Book Review or - still  unlikely yet - the
New York Review of Books - and we can all raise our eyebrows and say,
"curious!"

Routledge and La Pocha Nostra invite you to a solo performance and book
launch:

Guillermo Gómez-Peña
Saturday July 30th, 7:30 pm.
at Intersection for the Artrs
446 Valencia (btwn 15/16), Mission District
San Francisco, CA

Special guests include Rhodessa Jones and Routledge London editor Talia
Rodgers.

Cost: $5-15 sliding scale
Tix & Info: (415) 626-3311, or visit www.theintersection.org

“Ethno-Techno: Writings on performance, activism and pedagogy,” a new book
by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, is forthcoming from Routledge, 2005.

The performance of “extreme identity” is familiar to us all through the
medium of television (just switch on Jerry Springer). So where does this
leave the critical practice of artists who aim to make tactical,
performative interventions into our notions of race, culture and sexuality?

Guillermo Gómez-Peña has spent many years developing his unique style of
performance-activism, theatricalizations of postcolonial theory. In
Ethno-Techno: Writings on performance, activism and pedagogy he pushes the
boundaries still further, exploring what’s left for artists to do in a
post-9/11 repressive culture of what he calls  “the mainstream bizarre”.

Extensive photos document his artistic experiments. The text not only
explores and confronts his political and philosophical parameters, it offers
an insight into one of the most daring, innovative and challenging
performance artists of our age.

Guillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist and writer, and artistic
director of San Francisco-based company La Pocha Nostra. His pioneering work
in performance, video, radio, installation, poetry, journalism and cultural
theory explores cross cultural issues, immigration, the side effects of
globalization, the politics of language, “extreme culture” and the digital
divide. His previous books include Warrior for Gringostroika (1993), The New
World Border (1996) and Dangerous Border Crossers (2000).

[for immediate release and dispersal wherever unsafe literature is read]


I'm happy to announce the latest effing press publication -

LYRIC POETRY AFTER AUSCHWITZ: Eleven Submissions to the War, by Kent Johnson.
effing press, 2005.
7x8
44 pages
w/ code orange end papers
$7.00

see the cover and place an order at http://www.effingpress.com/books/aus.html

HAVE ONE SENT TO YOUR FAVORITE NEO-CON!

This handsome book by one of America's most notorious thorn-in-your-side bards collects 11 poignant pieces of prose and poetry that dare to confront the horror and absurdity of (the current) war and offend those who shut their eyes to it.  While most of America and its poets sleep Johnson continues to lob his dirty word-bombs into the crowd and the indictments are clear and there are no heros.


What some others have said of this work:


I think "Lyric Poetry after Auschwitz" is by far the most relevant
poem for/in/about this War. It is a poem for our time.

--Ethan Paquin


Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone would have to
invent him. His mind leaks nomads...

--Alan Sondheim

This collection finds Johnson representing our fiendish blind spots,
the nature of those far cries of human murderousness alongside
the fragility of identity and dignity, wielding homeopathically this
seemingly bottomless, merciless virulence, this miasma, in the
hope of helping to replenish the means of our deliverance.

--Lissa Wolsak

Finally, a gringo poet ready to offend all takers, even while
defending the likes of me. Many of these poems push you off the
long chow line of mutual admiration, asking where you stand right
now. Walk in at your own risk: Kent Johnson takes no prisoners.

--Ammiel Alcalay

Hi All-



I've been away from this list for a bit. I have had a blog up for a while
now, but I was kind of searching for how I wanted to focus it. I decided I
would use it to fulfill an idea that I have had for a long time, which was
to write something that would somehow integrate as much of what I was
reading at any given time into a coherent something-or-other (not sure if I
would call it an essay), because I have been haunted often enough by the
connections that revealed themselves to me between things I was reading.
Sometimes it was connections between different articles in a newspaper that
appeared to be about very different things, sometimes a poem connected
itself to another poem and so on. Anyway, I've committed myself to trying to
post once a week-excluding next week when I will be on vacation-and the
first post is up. The url is http://richardjeffreynewman.blogspot.com
<http://richardjeffreynewman.blogspot.com/> . I'd love to hear what you
think.



Richard

Richard,

Yes, and isn't that how we approach much of our communication? We spit out
responses based on how we personally-individually-uniquely connect what we
read-hear-feel.

You're very brave and vulnerable. How I connect things in my mind has
resulted in a few "huhs?" and "what the hell are you talking abouts?" If I were  to
blog, my focus would be to focus. Having a random or possibly ADHD brain
poses a problem for me and others, but it never really stops me from writing
posts like this :-)

Having the ability to see almost every point of view and its resulting
ambivalences does not, however, leave me to conclude that I'm capable of all of
the crimes mentioned, only some of them, only the ones for which I'm
predisposed.

Congrats,
Mary Jo

Ron Silliman says

"...at just under 71 minutes a full length recording
with production values that would make an indie band
weep with envy. Smith is the perfect poet for such a
project, as he has the most active ear of any writer
of his generation & he’s a great – if decidedly
deadpan – reader of his own work. Listening to this
recording feels like it takes 20 minutes & one is
totally engrossed the entire time, as Smith
demonstrates a range of affect far wider than I’ve
heard from him before..."

Hello POETICSLIST.=20
I appreciate your kindness.
Since I didnt get any reply for the first mail, I didnt expect to get
so many opinions about my work.

Somebody indicated that the translation problem.=20
I am poor at English and feel shy about that.=20
The translation of my works were done by my friend very slowly and
barely, and another friend is hepling make mailings.
I want to communicate with everybody who give great opinions, but that
will make my friend get into so tedious works.
I am planning to leave the preparatory course of BEIJING UNOVERSITY
and learn English as hard as I can  . Then I can have a good time with
people in the poeticlist.

Last night, I attended Patrick Ferneyhough and Charles Bernstein’s Shadowtime at the Rose Theater. I feared the reviews would not be good and they were not, that in the New York Times of July 23 is hostile, even if that of Philadelphia Inquirer was “curious.”

NYT Review: http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/arts/music/23shad.html?pagewanted=all


My review of Shadowtime is mixed. To me the production testified to one of the kernel truths of this age of America’s fatal self-immolation: overproduction, magnificent overproduction in glass, steel, and multi-story aluminum and crystal foyers. The venue: the Rose Theater in the Time Warner Building at Columbus Circle. These people will rebuild at the World Trade Center site. Still I always expected an operatic as well as a cinematic scale to the current avant-garde, a vision shard by those in the Dada circle or that of Jean Cocteau or even Blaise Cendrars who gave us a libretto for La Creation du Monde by Darius Milhaud. Ezra Pound wrote three operas. I have now had my suspicions of how spectacled might deride spectacle confirmed. My appreciation cannot detach itself from the very grandiosity and grandiloquence of the scale of the production values of Shadowtime.

The staging and set design, Director, Frédéric Fisbach and set by Emmanuel Clolus, provided a spectacular range of sensory experiences. Ferneyhough’s music also had a supersaturated quality: oracular and specular, the 12 voices of the chorus in their various dramatic functions, usually robed in a workman-like blue, the turning bed or chair, pulled bye silent ropes, on which a collapsed figure of Walter Benjamin or one of his avatars, lies collapsed under the weight of history. A stone, in a final moment of commemoration, becomes a transcendent object. That for me brings up the crucial issue of vision. To what degree can the matter here be attributed in any sense to the historical Walter Benjamin? Would he allow fact to be subsumed by aura? To what degree is the production a display of the fantasies of the composer and author? The answer is highly mixed, unsatisfactory in some respects.

The intelligence of the libretto by Charles Bernstein, with its at times insouciant irreverence, provides an element of refreshment over against what might be thought of as a sententious approach to the death of Walter Benjamin. To my ears Brian Ferneyhough’s music was a witty deployment of too many avant-garde clichés, sometimes brilliant in the fact of performance, but also too much exactly that, a score to be ridden with glee and showmanship and wit. The music flirted and bubbled with ethereal woodwind notes, dissonant and muzzy images that seemed to have very little to do with the trenchant realism of the author of the Arcades. “Shadows” suggests auras and ghosts as well as a child’s game of hand shadows on the wall. Folk material of this later sort inform aspects of the libretto, but I reject the notion that Benjamin sought to retrieve some form of substitute for the auras associated with religious medievalism, Jewish or Christian. For him the lack of the aura was a heal
thy fact of modern technological society, a freedom. A reader familiar with Bernstein’s personal iconography will have noted the intelligence and deep resonance with which it was deployed here, freely, in its own right (rite), again leaving a puzzle as the relevance of the work to either Benjamin’s thought or life. The famous Marx brothers (Groucho, Karl, …) are here, bathed in a red glow, and catches from his childhood, mangled in a Wittgensteinian language-game provided the texts for some the choral moments in the production. For all my mixed muttering, I want to identify two musical high points, the pivotal piano/recitative identified as a shadow play, Opus contra naturam,  and the epilog, a choral (assigned to the Angel of History) with raspy bass notes attaining a funereal and pensive somberness, providing in this instance a felt connection to the tragedy of Benjamin’s suicide. At moments like these, the collaboration between composer and poet reached it’s highest degree
 of concordance, as words and music seemed independently powerful, yet correspondingly reinforcing.

This list is severely deprived of international input, a lot of us have
a deep interest in seeing this list become more international.

I found your works quite interesting, the pieces seemed very different

Surely there must be online korean - english software to help you rough
out translations yourself.  it would be a good way to learn to play
with english, and I do mean play.

There are many kinds of english & the english you need to learn to
communicate to the list is quite possibly a very different english than
poetic english, the language of poems.

there is also the WRYTING list that you can join & submit your poems,
writings, improvisations & discussion.  you would especially find it a
fertile place to experiment with live interwriting,


thanks for being more than shy

With this backdrop, the arrival of Vernon Frazer's monumental
*Improvisations* strikes
with the sudden rumble and clap of a thunderbolt,  what Edmund Wilson called
*the shock
of recognition.* At 8 and 3/4 inches wide,  and 10 and 3/4 inches tall, the
sprawling page layout
comfortably  accomodates this enormous 700 page tome, making this book one
of the longest and  largest work yet of visual poetry-combining nearly every
imaginable mesh of  print layout and font styles. One would have to go to a
number of books by  Johanna Drucker to find work of comparable typographical
complexity. The  constant alternation of formats makes -Improvisations- the
most pleasurable book  to browse I've seen since Drucker's work and my
favoriate classic of the  form, Frank Kuenstler's haunting, hard-to-find
masterpiece, *Lens*. Reading the  texts themselves is also consistently
engaging, absorbing and amusing-Vernon  Frazer is a performance poet working
with jazz groups and has published several  CD's. As Geof Huth says in his
recent interview, there is a fascinating  overlap between the aural and the
visual in much vispo work, a synaesthetic  quality I find fascinating. My
only regret is, having to carry some groceries  home to Brooklyn from my
Manhattan office, along with Frazer's book (I
received  it very recently and wanted to write about it immediately) the
book is so heavy  I pulled my back out. But it was worth it! The book is
available from *Beneath  the Underground* 568 Brittany L, Delray Beach, FL,
33446

What would be the reasons for writing a manifesto about something
writers have been doing for hundreds of years, or closer to home,  John
Oswald's plunderphonics which I first heard about in the early 80s?
Just looking for a good reason to read thru it. Or Cage's writing thru
Finnegan's wake?

There is an excellent article on Xul Solar in today's NY Times
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/25/arts/design/25sola.html

Solar (1887- 1963) is one of the greatest modernist painters & poets
of the Americas and it was thrilling to see his major retrospective
show at MALBA with Ernesto Grosman and Susan Bee, when we were all in
Buenos Aires last month.

An excellent introduction to his work by Cecilia Vicuna is available
on-line in English :
http://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article.php?lab=XulSolar

While the MALBA show is mainly of his great watercolors, and indeed
he is known primarily as a visual artist, Solar was also one of the
most significant practitioners of ideolectical modernism, along with
Khlebnikov, Schwitters, and others.  One of this two invented
languages, "Pan Criollo" is a synthesis of Portuguese and Spanish,
you might say the esperanto for South America.  He also invented a
"Pan Lingua," more along the lines of zaum, with its VVV base
inflected by mathematics and astrology.

Grosman -- who is now teaching at Boston College -- edited a Roof
Books anthology of the Argentine poetry magazine, XUL, edited by
Jorge Perednik (among others). The magazine, from the 1980s, took its
name and inspiration from Xul Solar. Both the Roof Book English as
well as all the original issues of the magazine are now on line at
http://www.bc.edu/research/xul/

thus 'cartographic' -- exploring the territory that intertextual
writings have uncovered since Echo -- and manifesto, using that
territory as the basis for ongoing poetic practice.

plunderverse is an obvious nod to oswald's magic touch -- making
self-contained works of art through other self-contained works of art.


> Just looking for a good reason to read thru it.

well, here i am with no claims on reason, nor on good -- but writing
through what i have found useful. texts trigger texts, just as language
invigorates language; closed systems of infinite potential/invention.
the article maps out a form of unravelling within texts embedded
counter-poems that have their own unique and self-contained logic.


plunderverse is a name being used in reference to a specific form of
constraint-based, intertextual writing (writing through deletions, etc)
that a few poets up here have been exploring of late. the article in
question outlines the form and its roots in a community of
experimentation across generations and centuries, and provides a few
examples of how the constraint functions, and why/when/etc. the form is
an endeavour to write voice(s) into and through the excess of poetic
language, while demonstrating influence, reaction, and hyper-active
readership.

is it worth reading? well, it's the start of ongoing work -- !

Ingvar Loco Nordin has been kind enough to set up a page devoted to some
of the things I'm about at
http://home.swipnet.se/sonoloco18/glass/glass.html  You7ll see a great
picture of the late Lucid Larry, my crayfish, plus Biggie the goldfish
and a pretty nice stag beetle.  Graphic notation, performance texts and
visual poetry will be going up at the site in the near future as well.

The Sonoloco site is devoted to reviews of experimental music and sound
poetry (Jaap Blonk has a page there too).  If you're interested in
everything from Stockhausen to a wild Swedish sound poetess shaman named
Alientalo (heard her stuff--she's great), then come and take a look.

If the above link doesn't get you there, then go to google, type in
Sonoloco and go to "new" and it's yours.

Meanwhile we're going earthquake crazy at ahadada books
http://sendecki.com/ahadada/ because we suffered through one a few days
back, in addition we almost have a new on-line collaboration between
David and Christine Kennedy up.  Take a look.  Then take another look.

This book looks fascinating.  In a different review I read in =20
Scientific American it quotes the book as saying "Biggs recounts how =20
the Chicago department store Marshall Field's was selling cuneiform =20

The Looting of the Iraq Museum, Baghdad edited by Milbry Polk and =20
Angela M H Schuster
REVIEWED BY DAN CRUICKSHANK
THE LOOTING OF THE IRAQ MUSEUM, BAGHDAD: The Lost Legacy of Ancient =20
Mesopotamia
edited by Milbry Polk and Angela M H Schuster

Harry N Abrams =A320 pp242

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2102-1597272,00.html

This is a gripping, inspiring yet most perplexing book. It details =20
the rich cultural history of Iraq and sets out to reveal the fate =20
that befell the Iraq Museum in April 2003 when Baghdad was engulfed =20
by chaos as US forces stormed and took the city. At the time, the =20
world was told that the museum had been savagely looted in the =20
greatest cultural tragedy since the second world war. This book =20
explains the importance of its collection and places its fate in 2003 =20=

in the context of the looting currently devastating Iraq=92s 10,000 =20
archeologically important sites.

William Polk, an American academic and the father of one of the =20
book=92s co-editors, has written the introduction, in which he =20
describes himself as one of the =93last people to see the [museum=92s] =20=

collection in its breathtaking entirety=94. Polk offers a description =20=

of what happened in April 2003. He states that some of the =20
commercially most valuable =93or at least most movable=94 pieces were =20=

stored in the vaults but that =93even massive steel doors gave way or =20=

were blasted apart=94. He describes events with admirable conviction. =20=

We are told that =93gangs of looters swarmed into the building. Some =20
appear to have been professional, acting in concert with =20
international dealers and even with resident diplomats . . . Others, =20
probably amateurs, took sledgehammers and chain saws to giant =20
statues=94 while =93an =91antiquities mafia=92 quickly sprang into =
existence=94.

This all sounds plausibly reassuring: a terrible cultural crime =20
committed by cunning criminals, cynical foreign =93diplomats=94 cashing =20=

in on the chaos, the poor driven to looting through =93desperation=94 =97 =
=20
as the world and its greatest military power, the US army, stood by. =20
But how is Polk so certain about the nature of the looting? I can =20
only assume that he is describing events as told to him by others, =20
for he does not claim to have been in Baghdad in April 2003. Well, I =20
was, and the story I discovered was far more complex, mysterious and =20
political than Polk=92s account suggests.

As well as housing one of the world=92s great collections of ancient =20
artefacts, the museum was also part of the Ba=92ath party apparatus =97 =20=

as were all important public institutions in Saddam=92s Iraq =97 and its =
=20
cultural and political roles were intricately entwined. What soon =20
became clear to me was that the attack could also be read as a =20
popular act of vengeance against the party and its members, an =20
interpretation supported by the fact that the museum=92s offices not =20
its galleries were the prime targets. I
went to Baghdad with a BBC team at the end of April to discover the =20
truth of what had really happened during those few key days from =20
April 9-16. According to all accounts, fighting raged around the =20
museum until April 9, and it was not until April 16 that the =20
Americans placed it under full-time protection. =46rom April 10-12 the =20=

building was open to all, and it was during these three days that the =20=

looting took place.

Like many journalists, I was drawn to Baghdad by alarming stories, =20
circulated around the world by museum staff within hours of the US =20
troops=92 arrival. These suggested that 170,000 items had been stolen =20=

or destroyed, and implied that America was to blame for not =20
immediately guarding the place.

During a previous visit to Iraq, in November 2002 =97 to make a film =20
for BBC2 showing exactly what was at risk if the unthinkable and =20
insane happened and Iraq became a battlefield =97 I had visited the =20
museum, met its director of research Dr Donny George, and seen its =20
wonders. Iraq is rightly known as the cradle of civilisation =97 the =20
land where, 7,000 years or so ago, most things we consider to be the =20
hallmarks of civilisation had their origin: writing, mathematics, =20
urban living, arts, crafts, agriculture. And the Iraq Museum =20
displayed the treasures of the land =97 quite simply it was one of the =20=

most important repositories of culture, history and beauty on earth. =20
My conversation with George was fascinating. He told me that adequate =20=

precautions had been =97 and were being =97 taken to protect the =20
collection. It also became clear, as I walked around, that many items =20=

had been removed. Why, when and where these had gone no-one would =20
reveal. Unlike Polk, who appears to have surveyed the place after me, =20=

I did not see the collection =93in its breathtaking entirety=94. I =20
suppose it is possible that the removed items were returned between =20
November 2002 and Polk=92s undated =93last-minute=94 trip, but I doubt =
it.

What rapidly became clear on my second visit was that the pillaging =20
was a most complex event, with no obvious villains and with truth, as =20=

ever, being the first victim in conflict. Stung by the accusation of =20
responsibility, US forces had launched an inquiry, and were =20
initiating attempts to discover and retrieve missing items. I spoke =20
to these investigators and to US forces guarding the building =97 the =20=

same troops that had seized it on April 9.

Some very tricky issues soon arose, all of which are ignored by this =20
book. The troops claimed that the museum had been turned into a =20
fighting position. George insisted this was not true, and that =20
bunkers in the grounds were merely air-raid shelters. And then there =20
was the role of the staff. Some had been members of the Ba=92ath party =20=

while others, US investigators surmised, must surely have been =20
involved in the looting: a number of thefts from storerooms seemed =20
very much like inside jobs.

So what really happened and, more important, what is now to be done? =20
By the time I left, in early May, it had been admitted that the claim =20=

of 170,000 items lost or destroyed was an exaggeration. Quite why =20
such a sensational claim was ever made has never been satisfactorily =20
explained. I accompanied Mathew Bogdanos, the US marine colonel and =20
lawyer heading the investigation, and a team of US soldiers and Iraqi =20=

museum staff to the vaults of the Central Bank of Iraq in al-Rashid =20
Street. Although the bank had been bombed, its vault was intact and =20
sealed and many valuable items =97 including 616 pieces forming the =20
famed collection called the =93Nimrud Gold=94 =97 were found there safe =
and =20
sound. Members of the BBC team also joined the inspection of the =20
secure storage rooms at the museum. Although some had been entered =20
and items stolen =97 and weapons left behind seemingly confirmed that =20=

parts of the building had been used as a fighting position =97 the =20
other storage rooms were intact, with doors locked and stacks of =20
crates containing treasures apparently still sealed and untouched. =20
Contrary to what Polk says, the doors of none of these rooms had been =20=

=93blasted apart=94: they were either still locked or had been entered =20=

with a key.

By June the number of important items missing had been scaled down to =20=

just 32, although tens of thousands of relatively minor pieces were =20
still missing. In the following weeks other significant items were =20
returned or discovered during swoops, including the hugely important =20
5,000-year-old Warka Vase. This was the one large and valuable item =20
stolen by a well-prepared and mysterious team during April 10-12.

George=92s account of events is most interesting. He is now museum =20
director, and has written the foreword to this book. When I met him =20
that April he was clearly exhausted, in a state of great distress and =20=

unsure about what exactly had been stolen. Now he states that =20
although =93the looters broke through the main galleries and the store =20=

rooms, stealing and destroying everything they could get their hands =20
on=94, the toll was around 15,000 items. George also states that, as a =20=

result of international efforts, around 6,000 objects have been =20
returned, including many from abroad with =93over 600 in the United =20
States=94. Material is, he says, being recovered =93almost every day=94 =20=

although more than 50% of what was lost is still missing. (The =20
British Museum=92s more gloomy assessment is that the toll of missing =20=

items remains at 15,000.)

I for one remain confused by what really happened. Back in April 2003 =20=

the one missing item that confounded all attempts to quantify the =20
loss was an up-to-date museum inventory. One did not seem to exist. =20
Has one since been unearthed, and if not how on earth have figures =20
been arrived at? Were the crates, discovered apparently intact in =20
late April, in fact unlooted and if so, where are their contents now? =20=

This book does not tell us. After reading it I am still unsure about =20
what has survived. It describes many of the museum=92s greatest =20
treasures without always explaining if they have survived, were =20
stolen, have been recovered or were damaged. For example, the 4,500-=20
year-old lyre from Ur is described and illustrated in all its glory, =20
yet I saw it in shattered bits in a workshop. An exception is the =20
stupendous 8th-century female bust, known as the Mona Lisa of Nimrud. =20=

In April this was regarded as one of the greatest losses. Yet it must =20=

have been stored in the flooded vaults of the Central Bank because =20
the book says it is safe but =93severely=94 damaged by water.

This book is a fine academic study of the wonders of ancient =20
Mesopotamian culture as represented in the museum, and also a plea =20
from the heart: as the authors explain, =93those who choose the =20
devastating path of war [must] understand not only its human cost but =20=

its cultural cost as well=94. But it is not the last word on the =20
region=92s tragic recent history. Certainly its simplified account of =20=

what happened in April 2003 does not tally with what I myself saw or =20
with what I was told by those intimately involved with the =20
investigation. The full story =97 the means and motives behind the =20
attacks on the museum =97 has yet to be told, and it=92s vital that it =20=

should be told =97 for only the truth can help heal the wounds and =20
soothe the anger that now torment this tragically fragmented nation.=

If - like myself - you were, unconsciously or not, looking for a Creeley
apparition and/or sighting, there is a nice one (well, it's funny and
something more, at the same time) over in Ashland, Oregon not far from the
home of Kasey S. Mohammed. Take a look on Kasey's "Lime Tree":
http://limetree.ksilem.com/

If you want, as well, another take on Spicer's "No one listens to poetry"
from Language, I have a new blog piece up today:
 http://stephenvincent.durationpress.com

If that's too serious and you want to lighten up, for some good summer fun,
check out Chris Sullivan over at Slight Publications, where he's got his
whole visual lang & audio shot rolling again. Smart and sly as a tack. Don't
miss the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge - I swear.
http://www.8letters.blogspot.com/

Of course, John Latta - I don't know what perfume he's on - but Hotel Point
is over the top, "mesmerismo" these days. He's really shaking up an
education in Americo Lit, and it's quite a ride, the quotes all churning and
bringing up magico touches. Tap this man's energy now. And give him a bed to
rest in when he gets out of the torrents.
http://www.hotelpoint.blogspot.com/

It must be the summer heat - no school and a lot of wonderfully messed up
heads! Can't be Karl Rove and his buddy Scooter and their two big bosses -
while everyone waits!

Enjoy,
Stephen Vincent

I'm afraid the narrow attitudes expressed in laurie duggan's abc =
interview
force me to SHOUT OUT THAT HE KNOWS NOT OF WHAT HE SPEAKS.
JUST LIKE THE PERFORMANCE POETS SHOUTED DOWN DAVID MALOUF IN 1978 AT THE
ADELAIDE FESTIVAL BECAUSE HE HADN'T BOTHERED TO FAMILIARISE HIMSELF WITH
MANY DIFFERENT POETIC ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN AUSTRALIA IN THE LATE
1970S. LAURIE DUGGAN HAS GROWN LAZY ON AUSTRALIAN POETRY AND=20
DOESN'T KNOW IT VERY WELL. HE PRESCRIBES WHAT POETRY SHOULD LOOK LIKE,
PRINTED ON A 2D PAGE, AND FLAT 2D PAGES OF POETRY CAN BE MORE =
EFFECTIVELY
DISTRIBUTED VIA THE INTERNET. AFTER ALL HE IS A BOOK EDITOR, AND HE IS =
ONLY
QUALIFIED TO COMMENT ON THAT, AND THAT IS ONLY A VERY SMALL PART OF WHAT =
IS
GOING ON IN AUSTRALIAN POETRY.
TO DISMISS PERFORMANCE POETRY AS ONLY FOLLOWING THE SLAM MODEL IS =
SHOWING
REAL IGNORANCE OF THE POETRY READINGS THAT FILL THE POETS UNION =
NEWSLETTER
EACH MONTH, IN ALL STATES. THERE ARE MORE PERFORMANCE VENUES FOR POETRY =
THAN
THERE HAVE EVER BEEN, VERY FEW RUN SLAMS.
PERFORMANCE POETS EARN GOOD SALARIES RUNNING WORKSHOPS IN SCHOOLS AND =
THE
COMMUNITY. IT IS A VERY ACTIVE INDUSTRY.
TO DISMISS THE HYPERMEDIA POETRY PRODUCED IN AUSTRALIA AND SHOWCASED IN
PAPERTIGER EACH YEAR, PUBLISHED ON CD-ROM, AND ON THE WEB, INFLECT AT =
UC,
FOR ONE, JAYNE FENTON KEANE'S SITE, AND PERHAPS MY OWN SITE AS
'HYPERFETISHES' WITH TECHNOLOGY AND 'MORE CONCERNED WITH THE BOX THAN =
THE
CONTENTS'.
HE DISMISSES THEORETICAL ADVANCES OF THE LAST TEN YEARS REGARDING =
HYPERTEXT,
THE INTERACTIVE POEM, THE TEMPORALLY UNFIXED EXPERIENCE, THE ABILITY OF =
THE
END USER TO  DETERMINE A DIRECTION THROUGH A TEXT, THE UNIQUENESS OF =
EACH
ENGAGEMENT WITH A HYPERMEDIA POEM, THE SOFTWARE PROCESSING OF TEXTS, THE
POLY-SEMIOTIC READING OF THESE PIECES, THE USE OF MOTION AND ANIMATION,
SOUND AND IMAGE NOT TO DECORATE BUT TO WORK WITH THE WORDS TO TELL NEW
POETRY IN NEW CONTAINERS.

IT UPSETS ME HOW PEOPLE WHO AREN'T PREPARED TO ENGAGE WITH A MEDIUM ARE =
ITS
MAIN CRITICS, AND ESTABLISH A DUALITY BETWEEN THE NEW AND THE KNOWN SO =
THAT
THEY CAN FEEL SECURE THAT AT LEAST THEY CAN BE MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL =
POETS
IN ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT.

THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE BOOK PUBLISHING INDUSTRY, PEOPLE STILL =
SEE
THIS AS CURRENCY, BUT WHY DENY WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING OR IS POSSIBLE. =
PLEASE
GIVE ME POETS WHO CELEBRATE ITS MULTIPLICITY AND NOT ITS UNITY/DUALITY, =
WE
HAD ENOUGH OF THAT IN THE 1970S FROM WHAT HISTORY TELLS ME.

CHEERS
Oh i'll be quiet now, sorry, cheers

Great work jim
Wow
So what we type gets fed to search engine

then loads them as a slideshow.
Is that right?

Hi all.

I recently moved to NYC and have submitted several letters and CVs to
colleges looking for adjunct teaching.  What I am VERY curious about now is
this:  Is there a chance in hell I will get any teaching for this Fall?  Is
the adjunct market flooded in this town?  I have a PhD (and a many people
think i have a sparkling personality, though some do not think so).

Is there ANY hope for me who wants to teach?

What are my ODDS?

Thanks deeply for any and all advice,

KG

Both the SoundEye International Poetry Festival in Cork and Wild Honey =
Press have=20
proved invaluable to me in terms of being able to function as a poet, not =
only in Ireland but especially in Ireland.  Participating in the SoundEye =
Festival this year, and also benefiting from the magnificent collection of =
books assembled by Simon Cutts and Erika Van Horn, reminded me strongly of =
how isolated I once felt in Ireland, maybe unnecessarily.  I think of =
writer/artists in Ireland now, e.g., Martin Folan, who are outside the =
loop aesthetically and professionally except perhaps in community arts, =
but who do in fact have company if only they could find it.  I still feel, =
as I felt 20 years ago, that poetry in Ireland is a narrow tradition and =
if one's work is not primarily lyric and recognizably so that one may have =
a very hard time getting published. There are lots of other reasons to be =
sidelined too: Eavan Boland has articulated very well the movement of =
women writers from muse to poet, not without resistance.  The answer of =
course is to establish one's own press, though my answer was to emigrate. =
=20

I all the more admire Trevor and Randolph who did establish presses and =
festivals, from which I, among so many, have benefited.  It was my good =
luck to leave Ireland at a time when the Internet was connecting poets in =
a new way; I fell gladly into its nets.  The issue of nationality in terms =
of poetry is complicated now.  I think of myself as an Irish poet insofar =
as I try to assess my relationship to the tradition of Irish poetry.  I am =
very glad to be associated with both SoundEye and Wild Honey.
I think both are very significant initiatives historically.  On a personal =
level, the connection also makes me happy.  There is a small sense of =
community which I welcome, being much more accustomed to estrangement, for =
many reasons including a perhaps poor fit with Irish poetry to begin with, =
and immigration. =20

I have mixed feelings about categories, e.g., "Irish poet" or "experimental=
/innovative Irish poet."  I feel a certain amount of unease using these =
terms.  They're useful descriptors too though, and I respect the energy =
that has gone into their establishment. =20

Charles Bernstein describes Randolph Healy's work with Wild Honey as "a =
classic case of a poet with very limited support managing to do major =
cultural work."  I wholeheartedly agree.  Trevor's achievement with =
SoundEye, and New Writers Press, is also major.  David Bircumshaw seems to =
disrespect them but I think them deserving of consummate respect. =20

I feel a large debt of gratitude to both Randolph and Trevor, sharp =
admiration of their poetry, and a good deal of pleasure and excitement in =
Irish poetry as they, and others, are defining it.

>>> bernstei@BWAY.NET 07/19/05 9:36 AM >>>
Trevor Joyce has provided a useful list of Irish poets and poets with
Irish connections. Not surprising, since Joyce is a central figure
not only in supporting new poetry in Ireland but also connecting
poets in Ireland to those with whom they have affinities in the UK
and US. It is a good thing that Joyce, Maurice Scully, Randolph
Healey, and others, have worked so hard to create these connections,
since Irish poets working outside the convenient and narrow markers
of dominant styles have a hard time getting their work known in their
own country and beyond -- and for that matter finding each other.

When I was in Cork recently for the SoundEye poetry festival, it was
a pleasure to reconnect with Catherine Walsh, whom we had invited to
Buffalo in the early 90s and who remains a favorite poet of mine. I
highly recommend her books -- Short Stories, Pitch, and Eatortha &
Making Tents. (Walsh co-edits hardPressed Poetry press with her
husband, the poet Billy Mills: http://gofree.indigo.ie/~hpp/frame.html.)

The good news I heard at Cork is that Wild Honey Press is going to be
doing a new, large collection of Walsh's work. This will add to the
already substantial set of books published by Randolph Healey at Wild
Honey. Healey's work with Wild Honey is a classic case of a poet with
very limited support managing to do major cultural work. The Wild
Honey website is at http://www.wildhoneypress.com/

I would also recommend Healey's 2002 collection from Salt Publishing,
Green 532 -- about which I wrote a few words at the time of
publication -- **If poetry can sometimes be the right thing for the
right reason, then Randolph Healey's Green 532 has all les mots
justes -- just notes -- to shake the tale loose from the tribe and
dance with it. Lurking, like a lark, somewhere between "reflection
and shadow", these poems are cosmological forays into the "fragile,
transitory, precarious" uncertainty that underlies our ability to =
respond.**

I first encountered the work of Geoffrey Squires at his Cork reading.
I immediately picked up his collection from Wild Honey -- Untitled
and Other Poems 1975-2002. The line that first caught my ear was "a
deep immobility even in things that can be moved"  but then, quick
upon: "liquidity of noise that one almost see" &  "the broken
refracted light". These spare yet somehow lushly dark,
epistemologically searching poems suggested, at first, a fusion of
William Bronk and Merrill Gilfillan. The lines noted are from
Landscape & Silences (originally published by Dublin's New Writers'
Press in  1996), in which Squires creates a poem that distends time;
that is, slows it down so much that it thickens in the ear. Reading
further, I am stuck by Squires's uncanny ability to use the lyric as
fault line for the intersection of perception and consciousness. Also
to note: most of his poems are serial (in the sense of Oppen's
Discrete Series); seriality in this work is linked both to Squire's
immanent ecopoetics and suffused phenomenology.

Trevor's Joyce's list of Irish and Irish related poets posted to Poetics =
is at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=3Dind0507&L=3Dpoetics&D=3D1&=
O=3DD&F=3D&S=3D&P=3D24372

& indeed, CA Conrad is right -- Simon Cutts is a terrific book
artist; his "Vinyl" show was the backdrop to the SoundEye Festival.

Unfortunately, one of the best times to look for a teaching job at any level
is not now but just before Labor Day, i.e., just before schooling anywhere
starts, when they discover they have a last minute gap.Good luck to you.

Just wanted to see if there is anyone out there interested in applying
for
an adjuct creative writing teaching position at The College of New
Jersey.
The teaching load is two courses, both 200 level creative writing, which
covers poetry and fiction. Since this is (unfortunately) an adjunct
position, the money isn't great at all, but the students are very good.
The same position will also be available in the spring.

The college is in Ewing NJ--about 40 minutes from Philly and about an
hour
and a half from NYC by train. I believe the position is advertised on
the
Chronicle of Higher Ed web page and the AWP web page. The deadline is
fast
approaching, but if you are interested in more info, drop me a line
backchannel!

All best,

in the sort of art i do, i have to do too much work: graphics, writing,
programming, animation, html, sound, etc.

also, if you load a  web piece up with lots of graphics and so on, it takes
forever to download before it starts.

so i'm trying to make an engine for visuals i can use in other pieces that
consists only of text/code. let it go and find the pictures. to mess up with
algorithms.

currently there is more db than cinema in it. yes, slideshow at this point.
but the idea is to eventually do something different from slideshow.

i'm thinking this db/cinema approach can combine the strength of generative
computer graphics' *abstraction* with the representational, ie, the search
is on particular concepts.

google will return just black and white or just grayscale images, among
other options. good for masking. go get those first and then use them as
masks, say. and process the masks, also.

so images emerging from other images, images enclosed within other images,
images emerging from the abstract, disappearing into the abstract, the
abstract disappearing into the representational. dynamic. that's the 'goal'.
and have the images relevantly representational mostly though leave room for
the unpredictably associative.

but this is v0.3. ya, more like dbslideshow at the mo.

Vernon Frazer


BACK COVER BLURBS

Vernon Frazer's relentless pursuit of truth is inspiring. Improvisations =
commands our attention. It is difficult to recognize a landmark work in =
a landscape of hype and craftsmanship, but Frazer's embrace and =
reconciliation of the conflicts between poetry and language result in a =
musical and visual harmony that other poets have long neglected or =
sought with less success. Improvisations is a work to learn from and to =
praise without hesitation.

- Michael Rothenberg



Through its sectional appearances Improvisations has consistently =
offered its readers a dizzying flight across textual geographies and =
social aporia. Now we can encounter and engage its full monumentality as =
a vast text whose verbal excess and vertiginous typographic variations =
mark a stunning moment in the history of gestural poetics. It is a true =
comment on what it is to not only live modernity but to actively engage =
it.

- Steve McCaffery



Improvisations will take its place in the modernist, postmodernist and =
alternative pantheon of masterpieces. Vernon Frazer presents us with a =
'new physics' of poetic structure. It is not contingent upon any =
preconceptions of what poetry 'has been' or 'should be'. Its roots are =
far reaching and ubiquitously move rhizomically beneath the surface of =
the poetic page. It is there that Improvisations manifests its =
multi-dimensional, polyphonic, nonlocal music-of-the-spheres resonances, =
echoing down cerebral corridors and unfolding to the reader a =
synergistically limitless semantically rich poetic realm.=20

FROM NICK PIOMBINO'S FAIT ACCOMPLI

With this backdrop, the arrival of Vernon Frazer's monumental =
*Improvisations* strikes with the sudden rumble and clap of a =
thunderbolt,  what Edmund Wilson called *the shock of recognition.* At 8 =
and 3/4 inches wide,  and 10 and 3/4 inches tall, the sprawling page =
layout comfortably  accomodates this enormous 700 page tome, making this =
book one of the longest and  largest work yet of visual poetry-combining =
nearly every imaginable mesh of  print layout and font styles. One would =
have to go to a=20
number of books by  Johanna Drucker to find work of comparable =
typographical complexity. The  constant alternation of formats makes =
-Improvisations- the most pleasurable book  to browse I've seen since =
Drucker's work and my favoriate classic of the  form, Frank Kuenstler's =
haunting, hard-to-find=20
masterpiece, *Lens*. Reading the  texts themselves is also consistently =
engaging, absorbing and amusing-Vernon  Frazer is a performance poet =
working with jazz groups and has published several  CD's. As Geof Huth =
says in his recent interview, there is a fascinating  overlap between =
the aural and the=20
visual in much vispo work, a synaesthetic  quality I find fascinating. =
My only regret is, having to carry some groceries  home to Brooklyn from =
my Manhattan office, along with Frazer's book (I received  it very =
recently and wanted to write about it immediately) the book is so heavy  =
I pulled my back out. But it was worth it! The book is available from =

Mime-Version: 1.0

EDITING: CONTEXTUALIZING OR SOCIALIZING?

"... editing's first task is to offer context."--Ron Silliman

"Editing isn't contextualizing, any more than sculpting is, or curling.
Editing is socializing."--Jordan Davis

For the next couple of weeks I'll be conducting an experiment in editing.
I'll be posting to my blog:

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com

piecemeal, a book-length manuscript, tentatively titled "Fakebook." I'm
asking you to read the poems, prose & plays, and then respond. Ideally with
some idea of "the social" or "context" kept in mind, though that's not
totally necessary.

Responses can be to individual pieces, to groupings, to the overall flow, to
problems--aesthetic, political, etc.--raised by the work. Whatever you want.

If the experiment takes off (as opposed to "fails miserably"), the final
book will be in part a product of this process, and some responses may be
incorporated into the published book itself. (With, of course, your
permission.)

The first eight poems of the book appear, in order, on the blog now. Please
respond!

Thanks,

Gary

I should point out that Ron and Jordan were talking about editing

I'm "creatively" applying those thoughts to a single-author project.

new BOOKS from FLOOD EDITIONS [http://www.floodeditions.com/]


Merrill Gilfillan, Undanceable

With exuberance and economy, Merrill Gilfillan's Undanceable evokes the
landscape of the American West through the geographic word. Place names,
the texture of speech, and a certain aroma of nature permeate these pages.
Ever alert to unforeseen connections, Gilfillan follows both eye and ear,
his poems unfolding at the pace of consciousness.

A faint breeze

in the old swallow dens. A man
mounts a mare. And the roughlegs,
maculate riders, imperial

boreal tilt
and tack, wiser than owls,
drift disdainfully south.

--


Ronald Johnson, Radi os

First published in 1977, Ronald Johnson's Radi os revises the first four
books of Paradise Lost by excising words, discovering a modern and
visionary poem within the seventeenth-century text. As the author explains,
"To etch is 'to cut away,' and each page, as in Blake's concept of a book,
is a single picture." With God and Satan crossed out, Radi os reduces
Milton's Baroque poem to elemental forces. In this retelling of the Fall,
song precipitates from chaos, sight from fire: "in the shape / as of /
above the / rose / through / rose / rising / the radiant sun."

In his afterword, Guy Davenport comments: "Radi os is a meditation, first
of all, on grace. It finds in Milton's poems those clusters of words which
were originally a molecular intuition of the complex harmony of nature
whereby eyesight loops back to its source in the sun, the earth, the tree,
our cousin animals, the spiralling galaxies, and mysteriously to the
inhuman black of empty space."


--

Jennifer Moxley, Often Capital

First published as two separate chapbooks in 1995 and 1996, Often Capital
explores the tensions between political commitment and personal desire.
Moxley draws in part on the love letters of the Polish radical Rosa
Luxemburg in searching out a habitable space for resistance. As she writes
in an afterword to this volume, "In my researches I mistook my title, Often
Capital - a banal dictionary designation - as a description of, to use
William Godwin's phrase, 'things as they are.' Yes, often capital I
thought, but thankfully not always."

Moxley employs techniques of collage and juxtaposition as well as narration
to sound her subject. Yet the lean, sonorous lines that result leap out of
any categorical dichotomies: "our imagined finish line / is the end of
reason, the irresistible tantalization / of presence, lips pressed together
open / to eat..."

* * * *

Yours,

Yes. Altavista permits audio and video searches. I don't think there's
much data in those databases yet, however.

First these things develop around text files. Then image files. Then audio
and video.

What's going on OverThere that we all should know about?  First five
things that come to yr mind.

Myself, we have 25 young anarcho-circus folks called SPAZ who just
pulled into Dreamtime Village where I live, 3 giant brightly colored
school buses filled with bodies, instruments & props.  A lot of them
are interested in living cheaply & easily on the land, making new youth
culture, living outside the 9-5 grunt called work.  Some of them seem
quite interested in poetry, small press publishing, zines & agit prop
performance.

in the heat of our summer,

~mIEKAL

Whitman's America

By HAROLD BLOOM
July 29, 2005; Page A12

If you are American, then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and
mother, even if, like myself, you have never composed a line of
verse.

You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for
the secular Scripture of the United States. They might include
Melville's "Moby-Dick," Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and
Emerson's two series of "Essays" and "The Conduct of Life." None of
those, not even Emerson's, are as central as the first edition of
"Leaves of Grass," whose 150th anniversary we now mark.

Whitman, the American bard, our Homer and our Milton, broke the new
road for the New World. D.H. Lawrence, alternately furious at Whitman
and in thrall to him, saw his precursor as the poet of the Evening
Land, sharing in Melville's litany for the doom of "the white race."
The 20th century's dominant American writer, Faulkner, carried on
from Melville in what now can be read as a tetralogy: "As I lay
Dying," "The Sound and the Fury," "Light in August," and "Absalom,
Absalom!" Whitman's true heirs at home included T.S. Eliot's "The
Waste Land," Hart Crane's "The Bridge," and Wallace Stevens's "The
Auroras of Autumn." Abroad, the catalog is too large for quick
compilation: Lawrence, Lorca, Pessoa, Vallejo, Neruda, Borges, Paz
are perhaps the most notable.
[Walt Whitman]

Walt Whitman was the crucial celebrant of what I think we yet will
call the American Religion, the momentary fusion of all denominations
in an amalgam of Enthusiasm and Gnosticism that marked the beginning
of the end of European Protestantism in America, and which began in
the Cane Ridge Revival of 1800. The Southern Baptists,
Pentecostalists, Mormons, Adventists, and other native strains are
ongoing emanations of what began there. Our theologians and prophets
of the American Religion include Emerson, Joseph Smith, and Horace
Bushnell, among others. The philosopher William James is its
psychologist, and Walt Whitman forever will be its poet-prophet, who
sings only songs of myself. We now have an American Jesus and an
American Holy Spirit, and have largely banished Yahweh, except that
he marches as Warrior God, endlessly trampling out the vintage where
the grapes of wrath are stored.

Whitman's full aesthetic achievement is still undervalued and
misunderstood. He is the greatest artist his nation has brought
forth. Indeed, no comparable figure in the arts has emerged in the
last 400 years in the Americas: North, Central, South, or the
Caribbean. His six major poems: "Song of Myself," "The Sleepers,"
"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," and the triad of elegies: "Out of the
Cradle Endlessly Rocking," "As I Ebb'd with the Ocean of Life," and
"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" have their peer only in
Milton's "Paradise Lost," in Bach's endless fecundity, in the glory
of Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling -- baroque masters of sublimity. To
call Whitman, at his strongest, baroque must seem at first
paradoxical for a poet who professes to chant "Spontaneous Me," but
Whitman is no improviser. His artistry reflects conscious study of
his precursors in the language, despite his American nationalist
ambivalence toward British tradition.

Whitman restores the primal androgyne "Adam early in the morning." He
is our Vedas, our Bhagavad-Gita, our Sutras -- and also our Zohar, an
esotericist of extraordinary originality. Emerson was Elijah or John
the Baptist to Whitman's American Christ. Is not Walt as enigmatic,
elusive, evasive, fascinating as the Jesus of Mark's Gospel? Whitman
self-published "Leaves of Grass" and sent it unsolicited to Emerson,
who responded to the brash and canny self-promoter on 21 July, 1855,
that it was -- as a century-and-a-half later it still is -- "the most
extraordinary piece of wit & wisdom that America has yet
contributed." Emerson continued, "I am very happy in reading it, as
great power makes us happy. . . . I give you joy of your free & brave
thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said
incomparably well, as they must be. . . . I rubbed my eyes a little
to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the
book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of
fortifying and encouraging." Emerson invented the American Religion;
Whitman incarnated it.

Emerson showed his own wit and wisdom in commending Whitman for wit
and wisdom rather than for exuberance and democracy. As our greatest
American poet, Whitman is the supreme Formalist, though "Formalist
poetry" is a redundancy. His art is nuance, delicacy, inventiveness,
intricate matching of sound to sense. All poetic form, however
newfangled, is necessarily metaphoric, a substitution of figurative
for literal. And no poet makes it as impossible for us to know what
is figurative and what is literal as Whitman.

The more deeply you read him, the more you encounter his suppressed
allusiveness, his gathering self-awareness of the complexities of
poetic tradition, which he urges himself to usurp. In his battle for
self-reliance, he remains Shakespearean and High Romantic, as much a
Wordsworthian as Emerson himself. The poet James Wright celebrated
"the old man, Walt Whitman" less for his famous dialectic of Myself
and the Real Me or Me Myself than for his "delicacy" of poetic form.
The delicate, unknowable soul was the greater mystery for Whitman, as
it was for Emerson, who summarized for them both, in "The Over-Soul,"
"The soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her,
leaving worlds behind her." And, more enigmatically, "The soul knows
only the soul."

Whitman's prime trope is not the vital Myself or its homoerotic
double, Me/Myself, but the fourfold Soul, the haunting, immemorial
litany: Night, Death, the Mother, the Sea. This ancient, universal
metaphor he rendered as peculiarly American, by reasserting the power
of his poetic mind over the universe of death. Whitman, the American
Jesus, longed for the day, resurrection, the father, the shoreline,
and out of this longing created the poem of our climate that James
Wright named the Shore-Ode. Whitman's elegies for the self are our
American answer to Wordsworth's English Romantic Crisis-Ode, to
Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality . . . ," Coleridge's
"Dejection: an Ode," Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind," and Keats's
great odes. Whitman is darker than they. To the British romantics,
experiential loss is compensated by imaginative gain; to us as to
Emerson, echoing Lear, "Nothing is got for nothing," echoing Lear to
Cordelia: "Nothing will come of nothing . . . ."

Like Elijah and John the Baptist, the bard of "Leaves of Grass" also
"gets out" into the Wilderness, but it is a way station only, and
wildness is anything but formless: this new American poetry's
paradigm is the King James Bible, with nuances of William Tyndale and
Miles Coverdale, geniuses of translation whose stylistic sublimity is
equaled in English only by Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Blake,
Wordsworth, and Whitman. Whitman's highest art is Exodus, the
metaphor of "get thee out from" Ur of the Chaldees or from Egypt into
the promised land of a still undiscovered America. While Walt does
keep shouting "Kosmos!" I cannot locate New Age Cosmic Consciousness
in him. The early notebook fragments contain the seedbed of this
getting-out. It is a Resurrection:

In vain were nails driven through my hands./ I remember my
crucifixion and bloody coronation/ I remember the mockers and the
buffeting insults/ The sepulcher and the white linen have yielded me
up/ I am alive in New York and San Francisco,/ Again I tread the
streets after two thousand years./ Not all the traditions can put
vitality in churches/ They are not alive, they are cold mortar and
brick,/ I can easily build as good, and so can you: -- / Books are
not men --

Whitman finally won over even the aging Henry James, who in his youth
had given a bad review to "Drum-Taps." The American public, the brash
young Henry insisted then, would reject Whitman in the name of their
higher culture. Later, and much wiser, the master of the American
novel would ask that "Lilacs" be read aloud to him, and wept (as I
do) at the magnificence of our greatest poem's closing harmonies:

Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,/ The song,
the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,/ And the tallying chant,
the echo arous'd in my soul,/ With the lustrous and drooping star
with the countenance full of woe,/ With the holders holding my hand
nearing the call of the bird,/ Comrades mine and I in the midst, and
their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,/ For the
sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his
dear sake,/ Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant in my
soul,/ There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.

Its more than Tennysonian organ tonalities are the antithetical
completions of the confident simplicity that opens itself to us in
1855:

I celebrate myself,/ And what I assume, you shall assume,/ For every
atom belonging to me as good belongs to you./ I loafe and invite my
soul,/ I lean and loafe at my ease . . . . observing a spear of
summer grass.

Though Whitman later denied it, Emerson made the first "Leaves of
Grass" possible. Emerson credited Whitman with the "Appalachian
enlargement" of our literature. "As sane as the sun" was one of
Whitman's final tributes to Emerson. My own favorite among Whitman's
anecdotes is of his last visit to the then senile Emerson. The
greatest of our poets so stationed his chair that he could stare
fully at the benign countenance of his mentor, and each sat silently,
Whitman in loving reverie, Emerson in the tragic solitude of an
Alzheimer's victim. It was the final act in a grand drama of
influence that is still ongoing in our literary culture.

Mr. Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale. This essay is
adapted from his introduction to "Leaves of Grass (July, 1855 ed.),"
just published by Penguin Classics.

Greetings,

We've convinced poet Landis Everson to come up from his digs in sunny
San Luis Obispo to give what might well be his first public poetry
reading in the Bay Area since he last read for the Poetry Center in
November 1956.   Landis was close friends with Jack Spicer, Robin
Blaser, Robert Duncan, et al, discovered a gift for poetry in that
milieu (he, Spicer, & Blaser shared a sunday poetry group in 1960, to
which Duncan was dis-invited!) and was greatly admired by all of
them.  His last published work of that era, following a pamphlet
Postcard from Eden published by James Herndon, was in Locus Solus in
1962, John Ashbery & Harry Mathews's elegant & hefty magazine
published in Paris.  After Spicer died and Robin moved to Vancouver,
Landis stopped writing poetry.  He felt he'd lost his audience.

Years went by, as they say, until recently, while working on what
would become a terrific Berkeley Renaissance feature for Fulcrum
magazine*, young Boston poet Ben Mazer re-discovered Landis Everson &
his poetry.  When Mazer appeared and got interested in Everson as a
poet, Landis started writing again, and he's now written some 200
poems in the past few years, which are getting published all over the
place.  While we await a future collection of the poetic works of
Landis Everson, he will be appearing this fall in San Francisco,
Saturday October 29th, 7:30 pm at the Unitarian Center, 1187 Geary
(at Franklin), sponsored by the Poetry Center.

I've invited Kevin Killian to present on that evening, along with
others working with that material, some of Jack Spicer's unpublished
works, to set the stage for Landis.  Kevin proposed a world premier
reading of Spicer's play Young Goodman Brown.  I suggested that the
play be bracketed by a few of Spicer's lost-and-found poems, maybe a
letter or two.  It'll be Halloween --or close-- & Hawthorne's tale of
shattered innocence, dark woods, & a witch's sabbath should sit just
right.

Please put the date down for participating on this special evening.
And I thank you in advance.

best regards,
Steve

Sorry!  This is from Steve Dickison at the San Francisco Poetry  Center:




Greetings,


We've convinced poet Landis Everson to come up from his  digs in sunny San
Luis Obispo to give what might well be his first public poetry  reading in the
Bay Area since he last read for the Poetry Center in November  1956.   Landis
was close friends with Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser,  Robert Duncan, et al,
discovered a gift for poetry in that milieu (he, Spicer,  & Blaser shared a sunday
poetry group in 1960, to which Duncan was  dis-invited!) and was greatly
admired by all of them.  His last published  work of that era, following a pamphlet
Postcard from Eden published by James  Herndon, was in Locus  Solus in 1962,
John Ashbery & Harry Mathews's  elegant & hefty magazine published in Paris.
After Spicer died and  Robin moved to Vancouver, Landis stopped writing
poetry.  He felt he'd lost  his audience.


Years went by, as they say, until recently, while  working on what would
become a terrific Berkeley Renaissance feature  for Fulcrum magazine*, young
Boston poet Ben Mazer re-discovered Landis  Everson & his poetry.  When Mazer
appeared and got interested in  Everson as a poet, Landis started writing again,
and he's now written some 200  poems in the past few years, which are getting
published all over the  place.  While we await a future collection of the poetic
works of Landis  Everson, he will be appearing this fall in San Francisco,
Saturday October 29th, 7:30 pm at the Unitarian  Center, 1187 Geary (at
Franklin), sponsored by the  Poetry Center.


I've invited Kevin Killian to present on that evening,  along with others
working with that material, some of Jack Spicer's unpublished  works, to set the
stage for Landis.  Kevin proposed a world premier reading  of Spicer's play
Young Goodman Brown.  I suggested that the play be  bracketed by a few of
Spicer's lost-and-found poems, maybe a letter or  two.  It'll be Halloween --or
close-- & Hawthorne's tale of shattered  innocence, dark woods, & a witch's
sabbath should sit just  right.


Please put the date down for participating on this  special evening.  And I
thank you in advance.


best regards,
Steve

Excuse any cross-posting:

Judy Coburn kindly forwards this. I am not sure where Steve Jobs gave the
talk. It's interesting to know - at least among poets - that, though he doe=
s
not mention him by name,  Jobs, as a student at Reed College in the Sixties=
,
probably learned calligraphy from Lloyd Reynolds - who also taught Phillip
Whalen, Lew Welch and Gary Snyder. (He also taught Sumner Stone who was lon=
g
in charge of creating typographic forms at Adobe Systems). Amazing how a
gringo Zen calligrapher - combined with an amazing college - was the source
of such influence on the creation and face of both 20th century poetry and
computers. Hats off to both Reynolds and Jobs, a speech that makes me
homesick for all the creative fires and lives born of the Sixties. How have
we come down so far? Karl Rove, eat my hat!

impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hello again Miekal,

The Minister for Immigration has finally allowed
refugee children to leave the 'detention centres'
(euphemism for 'prisons') they've been locked up in
for years - to live 'in the community' but that
doesn't mean to live freely. They're still accompanied
by 'security' when  going to the supermarket with
their guardians and so on.

The Sydney sun is shining - the sailing club is very
active down at the bay not far from where I live - you
wouldn't know it was a time of war.

 The price of Castello blue vein cheese seems to have
doubled - my partner just came in from shopping.

There are some readings on next week - Leonard
Schwartz is in Sydney- he's reading on Thursday night,
I'm reading with Rudi Krausmann on Tuesday night.

And the fifth thing that comes to my slow Saturday
morning mind is that none of this is much what anyone
needs to know - sort of like a really b-a-d blog

Your place sounds like 1975 to me.

Cheerio from Pam




Myself, we have 25 young anarcho-circus folks called
SPAZ who just
pulled into Dreamtime Village where I live, 3 giant
brightly colored
school buses filled with bodies, instruments & props.
A lot of them
are interested in living cheaply & easily on the land,
making new youth
culture, living outside the 9-5 grunt called work.
Some of them seem
quite interested in poetry, small press publishing,
zines & agit prop
performance.

in the heat of our summer,

~mIEKAL

I like this stanza from Douglas Rothschild's poem
"February 28th, 2001" in "The Poker #6" -

At the foot of the brklyn bridge
across from Shannon Applegate's apt.
yet another park, this one named
for Walt Whitman, has been turned,
in this case, by the GSA, into an
asphalt parking lot, for the GSA.
Cherry trees & leaves of grass
uprooted, to make room for the
westward expansion of the brklyn
supreme court; a strange retri-
bution for Walt's vigorous
support of the Mexican war.

All the best,
Pam Brown

There is a specific name/term given to poetry about paintings. I read it
once in an article, but can't recall. Anyone know it?

Thank you,

Who can say "poetry-painting & ekphrasis' in the same breath?
Can't we come up with a quickie, like "Paint-Po" or "Po-Paint" - as
"He/she's into Paint-Po" or "Po-Paint"??

I suspect it's important to separate poems 'about' paintings from poems and
graphic work in which the two mediums are implicitly or seamlessly of one
another.

It is my understanding that ekphrastic poetry is
poetry written in response or in relation to works of
visual art.  Seems highly appropriate to the original
query.

Sure, we could invent nomenclature to be more
specific, to talk about poets who aren't moved by
sculpture (right, Ron?): but if you think you're gonna
catch me running around and telling people that anyone
is into "po-paint," well you're just as likely to hear
me calling myself post-post-lyric.

In the end it's all taxonomy, and like taxidermy, it
ends up lacking meat.

agreed about a long and great tradition...

the bit about lacking meat had to do with obsessing
over the naming of things rather than the things
themselves. obsessing over the taxonomy.

The figure of the blind seer / prophet is familiar, from Teiresius in Oedipus for instance.  The figure reoccurs in someone like Roland Kirk ("I Talk with the Spirits") and, I suspect, in fiction or drama of the Black Arts Movement, of which Kirk's work in music is a vital component.  Can anyone suggest works of the BAM that include the figure of the blind seer?

Please back-channel your suggestions & thanks much -

HIV/AIDS as the other face of terrorism


this media revamping of reality (bourgeois propaganda) is no different
than what occurred when most diseases were passed via colonizing
europeans who introduced and spread “the sickness”, be it mental or
physical, to the native/indigenous populations thus decimating tribes
and cultures then reworked their role from ethnic cleansers into that of
missionaries and health providers.

****


About the spamming of propaganda targeting the poor and the nonwhites as
the bringers of disease and destruction in this case of HIV as the other
face of terrorism -- if you do the knowledge, the people who are
engaging in risky behavior and even have encouraged and glamorized the
now POPcult “lifestyle of disease” are white middle class and
professional gay men – conspicuous in their absence on the recent
coverage ,or more, the spam attacks on media sites and within the gay
community will project this ‘positive is negative’ ideology onto the
swarthy, the bisexual, the lower classes and especially those who are in
foreign lands or who do not conform to the global bandwagon of
constructed sexual ideologies as designated by the u.s. (unformed state).

The porn industry, personal ads and party circuits for "barebacking"
videos and adverts, is targeted towards men of the more wealthier erie
noble “mobile” classes, mostly of the leather scene, who use poor youth
and nonwhites to satiate this “life on the edge” desire centered in
boredom, cruelty, power and human life as a chess game. The game can be
seen as the colonizing global business economy creeps on in life, as a
likkle death, on the backs of extreme poverty and the working poor. So
this risking and attracting the infection, aka. "the gift", becomes a
game of the ruling class and a ebenezeresque endowment to globalization
in order to ‘decrease the surplus population”, disable countries and
communities and have them come along side as the great 8 hold the power
of cures, poisons and research in check.

“This whole notion that ordinary western(er)s can help suffering
starving Africans by having a big party is patronising, shallow and
obscene…” – radio khilafah

The Victorian era used the poor and young males in the same manner as
“rule britiannia” sounded off in a country camouflaged in power and
tragedy of manners covering up it’s hypocrisy, syphilis, murder and
sickness. in these times of increasing legitimizing of the ‘flesh for
funds’ trade agreements which normalizes prostitution as an alternate
income source, and for white youth, as a "coming out process", it is not
coincidental, that neoslavery has become the rule of thumb and that the
gay community is pushing this mental state (from xtrawest to the glossy
amerikkkan puppet masters which bang the macabre dance tunes of lies
and shallow hopes of happiness and conformity), like a kkkanadian with a
infected blanket, wraps it up like a gift to first nations peoples.

“How did this disease come of nowhere and metamorphose
from a gay white male disease to a Black disease,
disproportionately affecting Africa and female African
Americans? If it were a Black disease, we would have
been dying from it before the 1980's.”— Darryl James -- “ The Black Top
Ten: Evidence of Racism”

this media revamping of reality (bourgeois propaganda) is no different
than what occurred when most diseases were passed via colonizing
europeans who introduced and spread “the sickness”, be it mental or
physical, to the native/indigenous populations thus decimating tribes
and cultures then reworked their role from ethnic cleansers into that of
missionaries and health providers. let's not forget the travesty of the
poppy show of "live8" which only serves as the propaganda machine for
the global holocaust of amerikkka and her all lies.

"we felt and had expressed very strongly that the Live 8 and Make
Poverty History campaigns in many ways were taking us back to an
Edwardian era of tea and sympathy, that they were replacing our
political campaigns with philanthropic campaigns. And they were handling
the G8 leaders as if they were the potential saviors of the world, while
completely ignoring and sidelining the harm that they were
doing."--George Monbiot


The posts and the propaganda will, like most media in this denial and
(RE)creation of reality culture, sway the focus away from the privileged
classes of white gay culture (and that gay culture here in british
Columbia) and choose to scapegoat the poor and nonwhites, and even the
population of countries and peoples which seem to defy globalization, as
being the axis of aids and hiv -- we have seen endless posts on china,
cuba, the poor, africa, the caribbean, italy and the increasingly
defiant and radicalized native peoples, whose youth are on the come up,
and who are clashing with the ethnic genocidal block busting practices
of the gentrifying urban and global powers, as the strapped suicide
bombers of hiv and aids. Not so coincidently, adding to alden c.
mayfield’s observation, these native youths are currently joining and
engaging “the mainstream systems of power and knowledge,” therefore
making themselves “able to right the injustices of the past through
political, legal or military intervention.”. This is no different than
the middle east be it Palestine or other muslim countries, who suffer
far less from, if any, the once, named “gay plague” now HIV and AIDs,
who are making moves to disturb the lies and colonizers and their
traditional romp of rape, plaguing and alternate career sources. Let us
note that with these colonial eerie noble practices the physical and
mental health state soon should “reform” these backwards civilization
and bring them up to the contemporary level of the western world and
it’s global goals of new world medical industry despair and disease –
and with this, in the case of HIV as the other face of terrorism, we see
“what Indians and Palestinians (and the poor and blacks) share”

I give in. I thought the question was aimed more at contemporary practice i=
n
which the material of the poem is a mix of text and image - one modifying o=
r
amplifying the vocabulary of the other. Instead of me trying to come up wit=
h
a term, I suspect it best to ask practitioners - if not "Paint-Po" or
"Po-Paint" as to what they call their acts, if anything yet. (Of course I
have never met a Language Poet who said what he or she practiced was "Lang
Po" - as in "I do Lang Po.")

In any case Ekphrasis is then term in which the poet uses the poem to
interpret or make drama of the painting. Done beautifully by many - say WCW
with Brueghel. And very tediously by many others. Tedious or great, I still
suspect  it rare that a poet - unless in the context of a critical, academi=
c
discussion - would use the word "Ekphrasis" as a working term.
Tho I could imagine an art school band calling itself the "Ekphrasiacs" -
maybe! Or a drug able to produce beautiful combinations of words and images
called "Ekprhasia."
