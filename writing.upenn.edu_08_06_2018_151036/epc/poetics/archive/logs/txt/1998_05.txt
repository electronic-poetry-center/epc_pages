Poetry is the business of surrealists who cannot benefit from poetry.
Now
_that_ I understand.

-- Fred M.


i've been thinking a lot about surrealism myself lately as i have been
preparing a manuscript for Coffee House Press. I have decided to begin
the book with a kind of surreal baedekker of a poem that nominally takes
a traveler the length of New York State "in Robert Motherwell's Car." I
liked the poem but didn't understand it (meaning I didn't know how to talk
about it, not that anyone asked!), until i realized that it had a surreal
structure rather than a surreal surface. It is made up of mostly realistic
utterances, but a three-stanza structure that runs through the thirteen
parts looks more rational than it is.  In any event, not to explicate my own
damm poem do  i write this, but rather to offer two things about
surrealism. One is a quoation by Ashbery, which actually found its way
into my "In Robert Motherwell's Car", which goes like this ( the "it" of the
first line being surrealism; it is from an Ashbery essay:

*Like all revolutions, it substituted some
new restrictions for old ones.... Real freedom would be
to use this method when it could be
of service and correct it.... Sexual liberty,

[Breton] proclaimed, meant every conceivable
sexual act
except for homosexuality
[Rene Crevel, Rene Crevel, Rene Crevel],* wrote Ashbery.



elsewhere, Ashbery mentions that Crevel committed suicide because of
his fear of being outted, i believe...



the second is a paraphrase of Wallace Stevens, which has really
troubled me: something to the effect that surrealism's major drawback is
that it favors invention over discovery.

one might ask what it is that stevens "discovered" in his poems; to me,
he invents a singulary strange, beautiful, intellectual space full of funny
sounds and musical instruments and corpulent plenipotentiaries. But
perhaps for Stevens, these places were discoveries, that he didn't feel
that he made them up, but found them. This seems such an important
question to me...

Joe Amato's level-headed post on this seems to me, after I too have only
had time to take a gander at the anthology, to make all the right points.
but I have enjoyed all the talk about the anthology, & feel it signals
actually how important both volumes are. i found it fascinating how 'new' &
'fresh' (to borrow from another thread) my poetry students found volume one
-- so much writing from the end of the last century & the beginning of this
one that they didnt even know existed. i think vol 2's range of material
from other languages will perform the same way for many readers (certainly
there are a lot of wriers in there I dont know, & am grateful the editors
have provided introductions).

a lot of FISH in that ocean...

Subject:      Stevens & surrealism

My guess is (wiser heads correct here) that Stevens was serious when in his
poems & aphorisms he asserted that reality (with a capital R maybe) is
inherently poetic, and that art and poetry are a kind of natural, organic-
integral process involving an encounter and mimesis or response to that
reality.  This is what he means by "discovery" - the realist or experiential
aspect of poetry.  Art as a "natural" process too complex for the "inventions"
of various facile or fashionable methods.

This seems related also to the obscurity/difficulty issue raised recently.
"Lyricism, music, song" are indirect or metaphorical indicators of specifically
poetic effects; that is, these words when assigned to poetry mean something
different than when assigned to music.  There is a particular radiance
in poetry which results from a synthesis of meaning, rhythm, sound.
Wit, feeling, meaning, structural development produce direct EFFECTS which
"come across" to the reader or audience.  Oftentimes it seems to me
the "inventions" of "experiment" and obscurantism are uncritically
accepted as progressive, avant-garde, "new", etc. without taking into
account these specific synthetic values - what poetry traditionally is
and does.  I know many of you have heard this from me before...
& I know there are equal dangers from the other extreme - producing
texts and poems that are merely rhetorical & conventional based on
the demand to "get it across"...  - Henry Gould

I believe that you would have to study Carl Gustav Jung's psychological
theories, and methods, in order to define what is "invented" and what is
"discovered" in Surrealism. Jung would, I think, have claimed that Stevens
"discovered" that space and its inhabitants, similarly to how various
manifestations of the archetypes, forming a universal and personal mythology
are to be discovered in the human psyche (arising from the collective
unconscious and the personal unconscious) where they take on a life of their
own, quite apart from intentional, deliberate, invention.

I do not see how anyone can really do any kind of credible study on
surrealism without having a good understanding of Freudian and Jungian
psychology.

On Cabeza . . . if you haven't seen Haniel Long's "interlinear" (speaking of
"writing through"!) of imagined letters from Cabeza to the king of Spain,
published by Frontier Press in the early 70s, that might be a place to
start.

in reply to michael coffey --

didn't stevens mean something like a distaste for what we'd call
proceduralism?  whether or not his remark contains insight about
=surrealism=, it certainly indicates the rush of meeting language
in its gifting domain (cf. some recent remarks here on the
'nature' of poetry, what it feels like to write it).  i feel sure
stevens enjoyed poetic trances, brief and sustained, that felt like
discovery, however much we want to say that he was the
co-shaping medium.

My favorite "surrealist" moment in Stevens occurs in "Esthetique du
Mal": don't have the poem handy now, but the passage goes something
like, "the paratroopers fall, and as they fall they mow the lawn" etc..

I wonder if Stevens would have written the line if he had known of
riding tractor mowers...hmm.

1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently almost 600 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
**<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>We also encourage subscribers to

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at

2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with Subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted
Poetics message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to
receive ONE message each day, which would include all messages posted to
the list for that day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line
message (no subject line) to


                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and
you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"


set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources
in the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts,
and direct connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The
Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an
extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as well
as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year
or search them for specific information. Your interface will allow you to
print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive


____________________________________________________________________


9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to
participate! Send a list of your press/publications to
glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the
address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If yourword processor ill save files in Rich Text Format
(.rtf) this is also highly desirable


Send us extended information on new publications (including any back
cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists
(including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to
include full information for ordering--including prices and addresses and
phone numbers both of the press and any distributors.


Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.=20
If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any
Poetics posts.


Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your
publication and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting
publications.

Subject:      what's difficult
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Hey Mark Presjnar:

        Thanks for your comments about the dialogue piece Jeff Hansen,
Stephen-Paul Martin, and I wrote for Central Park magazine on the subject
of "difficulty" in avant garde poetry, and for your comments about my
other work.

        I do have to say, though, that when you suggest that I "expand on"
Stephen-Paul Martin's point about the inherent "difficulty" of much
contemporary writing, it seems odd that you would say that about that
piece, because the point that you say in your post that I am making is
precisely the OPPOSITE of the point I was making there. Which is curious,
I suppose, given the subject of "difficulty" that is as stake here.

        In that essay, I disagree with Stephen-Paul Martin's assertion
that "difficulty" is one of the main goals of the texts we are writing
about, and writing--I say that the idea that such work is "difficult" is
one of the pieces of cultural baggage that writers of avant garde work
have absorbed all too often--one of our main "pretensions," I believe may
be the word I use. Sorry to quote myself here, but I believe I
say also that, "There is nothing inherently difficult about such works;
there is just something unfamiliar." I go on to say that I believe that
most people can learn to understand "avant garde" poetry with about
several hours (say, 3) of training, which is much less training, of
course, than they have received in how to read newspapers and novels.

        Given all this, I'm not sure how you could have read me to be
saying that what I an interested in in avant garde work is its inherent
difficulty, and so would be curious to know why you think that's what I
was saying.

        But perhaps I am misunderstanding you in what seems to me your
misunderstanding of me.

        It's amazing that what's so simple can often be so difficult.

        Mark Wallace

Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca [Cow-head!]; his real name, as far as I know.
Harvey Brown reissued Long's book in a beautiful Frontier Press edition
in 1969. A few years ago PBS ran a film about CdeV's journey--a bit

I know Joe & I often don't read things the same way, but my flyer reads
"almost indifferent to whether you 'like' it or not".  In my lexicon, at
least, liking something is far different from understanding it.  I think
I'd probably shoot myself if I had to "understand" everything I "liked,"
but hey, maybe that's just me.

Anyway, for better or for worse, lots of (perhaps most) readers, viewers,
listeners, etc. of art in its various forms DON'T get the same thing the
artist puts into it, especially with "weirder" stuff.  It doesn't mean they
don't "understand" it.

The real problem isn't "understanding" but rather how to get people (both
in the audience AND at the creative end of things) to realize that it may
be okay to respond to something without worrying about being "right."


I'm just now getting around to looking through the hundreds of posts that
accumulated in my poetics folder while working through tax season & for the
following week or two that I was computerless.  I'll just go back to
deleting & shut up now.

Bests,

Herb

Herb is right on the wording of the SPD flyer. But I must confess I'm still
puzzled about the choice of that quote to advertise a bookstore! If the
purpose of said quote was to advertise their broad selection of poetry, is
it really effective to say "52% of the poetry in our store was written by
poets who are almost indifferent to whether you like it or not"? I mean, I'm
not IN advertising anymore, thankfully, but surely there's other selling
points for this fine institution!

And furthermore (and I'm GLAD, by the way, that Herb and others read things
differently than me, it's what makes the existence of this list such an odd
comfort at times), how is saying, as Herb does here

> I think I'd probably shoot myself if I had to "understand" everything I
> "liked,"
>
any different than the "old saw" (Judy Roitman) of "I may not know anything
about art, but I know what I like"? As was pointed out to me by my
Humanities 101 teacher some 25 years ago, so does a cow.

Perhaps it's difficult to talk about these matters without raising the
spectre of the intentional fallacy. Herb goes on to say:

> Anyway, for better or for worse, lots of (perhaps most) readers, viewers,
> listeners, etc. of art in its various forms DON'T get the same thing the

>
        At no time in my conscious adult life have I EVER advanced the view
that a perceiver of art necessarily takes away -- nor should take away --
what the artist put into it! My question is a simpler one: to "like"
something, doesn't one in fact have to have SOME notion (however erroneous)
of what it MEANS? Of what it means to THAT PERSON?

        I mean (!), I just didn't understand Judy earlier in the week (nor
Mark Prejsnar's subsequent cheers) when she talked about an audience member
coming up to a poet and saying something to the effect of "I don't know what
you meant, but I sure did like it!" (because it had that certain "je ne sais
pas")?

        Perhaps my misquotation of the flyer got us off on the wrong
tangent; I wasn't accusing anyone of cultivating obscurity for obscurity's
sake. And I know (before Mark tarnishes me again with being "commonsensepo")
that there are other kinds of meaning besides the purely linguistic. One
wouldn't, for example, talk about MUSIC this way. But even with the music I
like, there's an understanding (again, perhaps an erroneous one) -- a
sensitivity -- to what I feel the musician and/or composer is doing. I
humbly submit that without some sort of this sensitivity on the audience's
part, art can't exist. Art must be perceived. Perception demands
understanding. Like it or not.

        (Welcome back, Herb!)

Spicer's collected 1945-46 appears as an edition of one selected by one
given to one then published by eight people in an edition of many after
the author left this mortal coil. It's the eight men out deal all over
again. Compare the anadiplosis in baseball. So it's entirely separate of
aesthetics, rather formed from contextuality in a quirk.

Quite different, Joe.  But then I think a response like "that's great, what
the fuck is it?" is an excellent response to a work of art, especially
"experimental" work, work outside what is considered the common practice.
That's why I say again & again on this list, as I did in what I wrote
earlier

>The real problem isn't "understanding" but rather how to get people (both
>in the audience AND at the creative end of things) to realize that it may
>be okay to respond to something without worrying about being "right."

Understanding is overrated and more important in an academic setting than
in the experience of art as such.  If there's not going to be a test on
iconography, a general sense of awe is a perfectly acceptable response to,
say, the Ghent altar piece.  What stands in the way of people
"appreciating" "experimental" art works is not that the work is so "weird"
it's that teachers etc. in school after school have drummed into them not
only that that they have to understand something, but that these are the
ways in which you can understand it.  The result is that people don't knw
how to deal with their responses to work that doesn't work in the ways
they've been taught to recognize.

Unless you're an artist looking for technical ideas, a critic, or a student
studying for a test, understanding is, literally, the last thing you need
to do with a work of art.  Before you get to that point, emotional and/or
visceral responses are not only useful, they're necessary.  & that's very
different from anything that might be called "understanding.'

What makes something poetry (or more generally, art) are exactly those
things that don't make immediate sense, the things that can't be summarized
or translated.  Texts that lack this, that are when heard read aloud,
indistinguishable from simple direct prose (like those perfect epiphany
poems and other expository narratives broken up into "poetic" lines that
come out of workshops), seem to me to be little more than journalism.  The
proper response to this kind of writing is "so that's what happened" or
"hey, thanks for explaining that to me."  If that's what you're looking for
from art, you can get plenty everyday for fifty cents at any news stand.

We obviously agree that "Art must be perceived."  But to say

>Perception demands understanding. Like it or not.

while very dramatic & all, is absurd.  (What model of how the brain works
did you learn?)

If anything you have it exactly backwards.  One can't understand something
without having perceived things about it, but you can certainly perceive
things you don't understand.

What was that sound?

The aesthetic intramural coherence among the words, phonemes, and
morphemes of a literary work in accordance with the referent object
(emotion etcetera) implied conferrent upon internal consistency of their
closed system(page or chosen media) of interrelations. There's plenty
more like baseball contributing to a lack of meaning, anomie. But then
should we allow discussions of sociologists on the listserv?

I'm sitting here listening to Herb Levy's remarkable internet radio site
(what a gift what a gift) and thinking at the same time to put down a
few words in thanks and response to Joe Amato's message of the other
day.   Like Pierre I've held back from responding to the various
comments - except for irritation with the original one from Ron - and
will likely never get around to doing it fully, but I'm grateful over
all and am more in agreement than not with what's been said.

The tough thing with this one is that we knew from the start that as an
anthology (and I mean a largely _contemporary_ anthology) it had to be a
flawed book, and we knew too that there was no way that it wouldn't be
read as an anthology in that sense.  For me, though - and I'm sure this
holds for Pierre as well - it was conceived, like other gatherings of
mine or his, as something else: an assemblage as a pulling together of
poems & people & ideas about poetry & much else in the words of others
and in our own.  That imago - that representation of where we've been
and what we've lived thru - is something in fact that I would stand by -
like any poem.  (It's also why we've allowed ourselves to end the book -
as epic poem replete with histories & voices - with two poems of our
own.)
        I've writen about all of that that some number of times - going back to
a piece on anthologies in L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E - and there's also an
available talk from the Orono conference on 1950s poetry in which I lay
out many of the issues around anthologies in general and this assemblage
in particular.  You can check it out through the EPC
(http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/rothenberg/50s.html), where it's
clear, I think, that I'm offering a critique that seems obvious to me
and not much different from what Joe and others have been saying.

About some of the more specific questions that Joe raises:

The omission of "more mainstream poets" was a deliberate aspect of
_this_ work, which an "anthology" as such might even so have included -
since our intention, as Pierre and I have stated elsewhere, was to
construct a work whose imagined center was what was elsewhere treated
(if at all) as a marginalized periphery.  Other omissions, when viewed
as an anthology, were of course more painful to us, though there was an
attempt for the mapping's sake to place some of  these in commentaries
or to bring them forward as translators, say, where that was possible.
(Spicer, since his name has come up so often, would be one such
example.)
        In the matter of inclusions - the other side of this coin - I would
call specific attention to the poets and artists around Fluxus, some of
whom are as vital to my sense of the times in question as any other
configuration in the book.  Thus we've given a promiment space to Mac
Low and Cage but equally to Emmett Williams, who I gather from further
correspondence with Ron would be absent from his own imago mundi (though
I ascribe no "deeply cynical" motives or "bad faith" to such an
absence).  We have also foregrounded a particular work by Robert Filliou
and regret not having been able to do as well by Dick Higgins or George
Brecht, while still managing in this instance to bring them in.

Joe notes also that volume two is more configured around "clusters" than
around "movements" or "schools", which it is and is therefore very much
an aspect of our sense of the times in question.  Anyway we take the
matter up in our iintroduction, and we indicate that the clusters chosen
are representative but in no sense inclusive.  The two American ones -
out of a total of eight such configurations inserted in the two
galleries that constitute the book's principal divisions - are the Beats
(early) and the Language Poets (later), with other U.S. groupings
represented in lots of different ways.  The featured foregrounded ones
outside the U.S. are the poets of the Vienna Group, the Arabic Tammuzi
poets, the Cobra poets and artists (Holland, Belgium, Denmark), concrete
poetry as a broader international configuration, the Japanese "postwar
poets", the Italian Novissimi and others, and the Chinese Misty Poets.
And in addition there are two made-up clusters - of oral (not
specifically pop) poetry and of machine & computer poetry.  All of this
makes a kind of picture but couldn't possibly pretend to completeness
either outside or inside the categories in question.
        (And again, I go into this in more detail in the Orono piece, and
Pierre and I discuss it briefly in the Introduction.)

On the "duplication" question - i.e. the carry-over of some poets from
volume one to volume two - Joe recognizes this as obviously
"deliberate," but wants to know "the terms of this deliberation."  In
brief there's a recognition that the dividing line between the two
volumes and times is, like all such lines, very dubious, and that the
work of any number of older poets continued to break new ground through
the 1940s and beyond.  So we added one particular section of
"continuities" (somewhat like the "forerunners" in volume one) that
brought in late works by most of those on Joe's list (Paterson, the late
Pound Cantos, Breton's Ode to Fourier, Ekelof's Mölna Elegy, Zukofsky's
"A," Neruda's Macchu Picchu, & so on) as a kickoff to what would
follow.  In addition we did an opening Prelude (subtitled, after Duncan,
"In the Dark") that set up a number of "postwar" poems that gave a sense
of political and social and psychic underpinnings for the whole
assemblage - including some late Akhmatova and a segment of Artaud's "To
Have Done with the Judgment of God."  The others Joe mentions as
carry-overs turned up in the "Book of Origins" section of volume one,
which was a non-chronological distillation of the kinds of things I had
tried to map in other anthologies, with Duncan, Césaire, Schwerner,
Ortiz, Olson, and others being shown as translators or otherwise
connected to the drive to reinterpret the sources and range of poetries
that the century has opened up.  (Spicer as translator [in a very
special sense] of Lorca also appears in volume one.)
        In a followup to this observation, Joe notes that the duplications
consist of 22 men and 4 women, which is accurate, but shouldn't obscure
the fact that as the book moves on, the gender balance shifts radically
until by the end (and without really pushing it) six of the last eight
entries (Scalapino, Vicuña, Bracho, Iskrenko, O'Sullivan, and Cha) are
women.  And the poetics of gender is taken throughout as one of the
significant and necessary breakthroughs of our time.

About Auden, whose name surfaces a couple of times in these discussions,
I don't know if I have much to say.  He was in fact going to be included
in the third gallery of volume one - with commentary & all - but we were
thwarted (as with Eliot and David Jones) by the economics of permissions
and let it go at that.  I was also inclined - though I don't know if I
speak equally for Pierre here - toward Dylan Thomas and even Robert
Lowell.  That was both volume one and volume two stuff, I suppose, and
maybe it should also be pointed out, regarding volume 2, that our first
draft of the manuscript counted up to something like 1200 pages, but to
start to talk about cutting-floor strategies strikes me as both
defensive on our part and offensive to those so cut.  (And this is the
reason why I, like all of you, hate anthologies.)

I want to note also that the book was completed more than two years ago
- publication having been held up by the pace of permissions and the
difficulties of production and design.  In the interval since - and
increasingly over the last year - we've become aware of the incredible
activity in visual and hypertext domains spurred by the new
technologies.  The section on machine and cyber poetry that Joe mentions
approvingly would correspondingly be much fuller if we were going at it
now.  Even so, I think that getting whatever we got into the present
mapping was/is a matter of some importance and one that will lead to
other assessments and reassessments.  That's all that such a small
section could do anyway - much like that on oral poetry: a vast
territory that I thought had to be in the book, even if limited to a
handful of examples of the kinds of language work (not just "song
writing" either as Ron describes it) by contemporaries of ours not
elsewhere considered as poetic equals.  (I.e., if Hugo Ball's "Karawane"
is a poem - and it is - so is Ella Fitzgerald's more complex variations
on "Lady Be Good," which we didn't manage to transcribe, or Dizzy"s
"Sabla y Blu," which we did.  So the point of that inclusion is directed
at our own assessments of sound poetry, say, when they decline to
recognize related "masterworks" outside of literature itself.)

Finally: a couple of things that have appeared or will be appearing on
the internet: Jack Foley's review of volume two at
http://www.hooked.net/~jalsop/jfucmod.html, and the introduction and
table of contents for volume two through the EPC (coming up).  It's our
hope that the presence there of many many issues and searchings will be
apparent as a basis for what we've done rather than the selection of
poets with which, if that was all there was to it, we couldn't possibly
succeed.

ps.  Exact Change has just brought out a photo reprint of Revolution of
the Word (with a changed cover by Marcel Duchamp), the anthology of U.S.
poetry between the two world wars that I did back in the early 1970s.
It certainly supplements (and in a few instances directly prefigures)
the present one -- though more clearly (to my mind) an anthology rather
than an assemblage or some such creature.  Some of the really striking
figures here (A.L. Gillespie, Jolas, Arensberg, von Freytag Loringhoven,
Harry Crosby, Mina Loy) are rarely presented elsewhere -- even more the
case when the book was originally published.

If people have moved on from thinking about the Tate piece, I'm sorry
but...
        What interested me about Kirch's review was the distinction I think
he is making between "difficulty"(usually. of surface) and "challenge"(
usually of content.) This distinction seems to go against what I imagine most
of us think of as "form" in poetry (FORM is CONTENT-- as olsen, creely
et al. said.) Still, I found Kirch's argument convincing. Are there
contemporary poets who it makes sense to talk about in this way? What would
this way of viewing allow us to see? What would it force us to miss?
        As a side note: Has anyone else seen Tate read after years of
reading him? What was interesting about the experience for me was how
different the poems were performed? When I read them at home the line
between what is funny and what is tragic is thin? Yet when he reads, it
seems clear that some lines are "funny/absurd" and others are
"serious/sentimental." The reading was a disappointment to me because... I
don't know.. the poems seemed less complex, somehow less interesting. I
felt I had been somehow misreading them all along.

Perhaps the _Relacion_ of de Vaca and, its companion volume the
_Devastation of the Indies_ of Bartolome da las Casas are fresh poems
for our late imperial romances. After walking through
Northern-hemispheric deserts and renouncing the low-intensity conflict
blood rituals there can be late twentieth century hope. But maybe not.
I've always wondered about the Karankawas. Is it possible to remember
them now?

Recommend John Sayles latest cinematic effort _Men with Guns_. An
american release in spanish (dialectos nativos, mestizo too) with
english subtitles. A somewhat didactic allegory (no more so than
_Matewan_ or any of Sayles work), somewhat based on Francisco Goldman's
_Long Night of White Chickens_ not unrelated to the passions of de Vaca
and de las Casas, and you and me kimo sabe. The central character
struggles with, lets call it, de vaca-ism, and its possiblities now.

In other related news:

Requiescat in pace Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera, you who were beaten to

You survived the 80s, a 36 year civil war, Reagan, only to be killed now

                        NUEVAS VIOLACIONES EN CHIAPAS

El Centro de Derechos Humanos "Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas" denuncia
ante la opinión pública nuevas violaciones a los derechos humanos en el
Estado de Chiapas de las que ha tenido conocimiento:

   1.Dos auxiliares de este Centro de Derechos Humanos, quienes prestan
su servicio social, fueron el pasado sábado 11 de abril asaltadas en el
centro ceremonial maya de Palenque. Después de este hecho han sido
hostigadas y seguidas en la Ciudad de San Cristóbal de Las Casas y,
finalmente, sujetos desconocidos entraron en la habitación de su hotel
mientras estaban ausentes sustrayéndoles documentos personales.
     Los hechos constan en la averiguación previa 204/18/98.

   2.De acuerdo a la información de la Comunidad "10 de abril", el
pasado 14 de abril de 1998, unos 800 elementos las policías de Seguridad
Pública y Judicial Federal, Ejército Nacional Mexicano y agentes del
Instituto Nacional de Migración, realizaron un operativo en donde
detuvieron al joven José Alfredo López Méndez de 17 años de edad y a
tres noruegos de nombres Nora Lanfelan, Laura Itzen Esten y Kaja
Langelano. La detención se llevó de manera arbitraria y el procedimiento
para su expulsión fue nuevamente ilícito, toda vez que no se les
permitió tener abogado en los interrogatorios y no tuvieron
     oportunidad de alegar nada en su defensa. Para esta agresión la
policía uso de gases lacrimógenos y disparos al aire y fueron guiados
por indígenas de la región vestidos con el uniforme de la Policía de
Seguridad Pública (usurpando funciones).

   3.Al concluir el operativo de detención los elementos de dichas
corporaciones, según la propia versión de la comunidad saquearon la
tienda cooperativa sustrayendo de ésta bienes por un monto de $
109,325.00 pesos y dinero en efectivo por más de $ 170,000.00 pesos.
Este tipo de prácticas no son extrañas ni nuevas, vale la pena recordar
el saqueo de casas y tiendas que la policía perpetró en San Pedro
Nixtalucum, en el Bosque en marzo del año pasado.

   4.El día de ayer 15 de abril el Juez 2º de distrito Roberto Alejandro
Navarro Suárez se rehusó a recibir el
     amparo que promovía la defensa de los Srs. de TOMAS SANCHEZ LOPEZ,
MIGUEL HERNANDEZ
     PEREZ, ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ JIMENEZ, ANDRES GUTIERREZ HERNANDEZ,
FIDELINO CRUZ
     MENDOZA, MANUEL HERNANDEZ PEREZ Y CESAR RODRIGO NUÑEZ OLIVA,
detenidos ilícitamente
     el día 13 de abril en el municipio de Ocosingo, sin dar explicación
jurídica alguna.

   5.El pasado 13 de abril, a media noche, presuntos elementos de la
policía Judicial Federal incursionaron en el poblado Santa Catarina,
municipio de Sabanilla y con disparos al aire intimidaron a la
población.

Este Centro constata el rápido deterioro de los derechos humanos en el
Estado y hace un llamado urgente al gobernador a que ponga fin a la
escalada de represión, libere a los prisioneros injustamente detenidos e
indemnice a los pobladores de la comunidad "10 de abril" por los daños
ocasionados por elementos de las policías.

De igual manera reitera este Centro que no es posible el establecimiento
del Estado de Derecho violando derechos humanos o creando un clima de
represión.

jerry, thanx so much for your detailed response to (again) my hasty
queries... i'm certain i'm not alone in finding much of interest and
insight in what you say... one thing that leaps off the screen is the issue
you raise re the "economics of permissions"---i had rather thought that
this must figure someplace in such a big book... and it was interesting to
hear too that the final product was hewn from an initial 1200 pp (and was
in essence completed two years ago)... i'm fairly certain that the 1200 pp
item would have eased certain anxieties (making vol. two a little larger
than _from the other side of the century_), but there is after all
something worthwhile in being a bit provocative (and i'm sure length was an
economics issue as well)...

i don't like to reduce everything to matters of teaching, but after all i'm
a teacher... and whatever one's feelings regarding anthologies, they can be
handy in the classroom--- depending on the classroom (esp. coupled with a
small press volume or two)... had i had volume two of _millennium_ i would
have used it this past semester... thus far i've used vol. one of the
_millennium_, paul hoover's _postmodern_ norton and ed foster et al.'s
_primary troubles_... i've used each of these anthologies 'successfully,'
albeit to somewhat different *measures* of 'success' (which right now i
just don't have the time to detail---and i used these three anthologies
with three different groups of students, so i can offer only 'case study'
experience anyway)...

oh hey, and why not:  i happen to enjoy flipping through anthologies---with
my brain intact, of course... as long as one understands that anthologies
are variously *motivated* collections, and as long as one (teacher, say)
finds ways to support smaller publishing enterprises, i don't see a problem
here (though i can imagine an argument re the way an anthology "comes at
you," it seems to me clear that the _millennium_ anthologies in particular
address their own problematic nature in this regard)...

well like i say volume two is a heck of an accomplishment, thanx again
jerry/pierre!...

best,

joe

Just a note to thank Jerome Rothenberg for such a calm yet committed
commentary on his own process & the product that necessarily had to emerge
from it. We all know there can be no perfect anthology; but it is good to
have two so dedicated bricoleurs working to create 2 huge volumes of
'assemblage.' I know I've got my (most pleasant) work cut out for me in
reading this huge text with the care it was put together with.

And, with regard to Herb Levy's comments, I'm pretty damned sure I'll enjoy
a lot of it before I 'understand' it all, nor does that worry me. And,
Herb, even in the universities, some of us try to suggest that
'understanding' a poem is a lot less important than 'getting' it in all
kinds of other ways. I do agree with you...

Just to confuse the issue of whether one need understand a poem to
get anything important out of it, I say one does.  However, I would add
that there are all kinds of ways to understand a poem other than the
verbal.

With experimental poems comes an interesting situation or problem
with regards to evaluation. When there is no paraphrasable content,
then at least one very widespread and traditional way to evaluate
a poem is no longer possible, at least in the same way--that is
to discern how sound and sense are in harmony or meaningful dissonance.
It seems to me that the criteria for judging what's good and not so
good must change when the experiment involves a conscious departure
from paraphrasable content. Do such criteria exist?

"With experimental poems comes an interesting situation or problem
with regards to evaluation."

I was attempting to get at this with the earlier post mean(ing).  The
criteria starts to formulate and appear at the experience of the piece.
In whatever medium. For me, in a successful piece, the criteria
establishes itself on the basis of the experience. Examples: While
experiencing Robert Grenier's r h y m m s, I found that the color
linkings between the pages as well as the scrawl of the work lead to
multiple parameters of possibilities of connective meaning. That's why
we published a section. Each "word" on the page has many possibilities
of interpretation. Each color has other possible polarities such as
elements, energies, and other archetypal interpenetrations. It lead to
questions of what the function of text and how it can impersonalize a
love letter (see: What I believe / Transpirations/ Transpiring on
O books) how handwriting relates to the mythic (see Duncan's selected
essays) where does art & poetry reach demarcation etcetera. A successful
piece flares to the mind an image of my current belief structure and
brings it through a process of re-interpretation.

Another great example is transduction, as created by Joel Lippman in the
70's, an excellent example can be found in _Prime Sway: a transduction
of Primera Sueno by Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz_ by John M. Bennett
(Texture Press). The piece tries to capture the phrenic or mental energy
of the original without a pretending to be a literal translation.
Questions of how all translations are translations over time (time of
translation versus original time written) flare into the iris. The
author adapts the text to fit their particular set of agendas
(Pound:attacking usury, Paul Blackburn: fixation on sound, Robert Bly:
to set meaning to one parameter rather than leave meaning as a
polytokenal(for a great example see Vincente Alexandre's 20 poems tr. by
Bly on his 70's press)). "Why set forth the false notion that agendas
are not being forwarded" is a major aspect of Prime Sway.

There's others if you want some more.

Be well

RE: National Endowment for the Arts, NPR, PBS Petition

Please keep this petition rolling. Do not reply to me. Please sign at
the bottom and forward to others to sign. If you prefer not to sign
please send to the e-mail address indicated or return to me.  Thanks.

This petition is being passed around the internet. Please add your name
to it so that funding can be  maintained for the NEA, NPR & PBS.

Here goes:

This is being forwarded to several people at once to add their names to
the petition.  It won't matter if many people receive the same list as
the
names are being managed.

This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of
$1.12/year of their taxes, a petition follows.  If you sign, please
forward on to others (not back to me).  If not, please don't kill
it-send it to
the email address listed here:  wein2688@blue.univn PBS,

NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major cutbacks in
funding.  In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending
costs and streamline their services, some government officials believe
that
the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of
funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile.  Currently,taxes
from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the

National Endowment for the Arts equals $0.64 a year.

A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans

wish to keep funding for PBS, this percentage of people polled is
surpassed only by national defense and law enforcement as the programs
that are
the most valuable for federal funding.

Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have 13
subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.  Each
subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill.  The goal each year is
to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is
October 1.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of
support for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making our

voices heard.

Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends if you
believe in what we stand for. This list will be forwarded to the
President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States,

and Representative
Newt Gingrich, who is the instigator of the action to cut funding to
these worthwhile programs.

*If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc. signer of this
petition, please forward a copy to: wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu.

If that address is inoperative, please send it to:
kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu.

This way we can keep track of the lists and organize them.

alive.

Thank you.

Seems to me one might begin from the definition of poetry as "language
charged with meaning to the utmost degree." And one can compare
'experimental' poems and argue about such charge. Just as one may look at
Thomas Hardy's elegy to Swinburne next to Pound's elegy to Swinburne and (I
think) make a pretty argument that Hardy's is the 'better' poem. But is
that all we're after. Do we really read poetry to determine which poems are
better than others according to various criteria? Isn't it better to look
at those poems, respond to them in a variety of ways, and try and come to a
sense of why it is exciting or enlightening to read them?

Still, I'm not sure you couldn't look at the criteria you name above (sound
and sense in harmony or meaningful dissonance) and apply it to experimental
poems. I could imagine Mac Low's Light Poems standing up fairly well to
such an analysis. I don't think "having paraphrasable content" is the only
way a poem can exhibit "sense."

Oht-oh, looks like this thread gonna start heating up.  Michael McColl
speaks of poems with no paraphrasable content.  I would claim that any
poem without SOME paraphrasable content, if that's possible, is
worthless--as a poem.  But I'm pretty narrow in my definition of poetry
as something semantic.  If you're talking about some kind of "sound
poetry" that has no verbal meaning, then, for me, it's music, to be
judged as music is, but its variety of sounds and how they are used with
and against each other.  "Visual poetry" sans verbal meaning should
similarly be judged by visual criteria, how their colors and shapes are
used with and against each other.

I haven't been following this thread closely, so forgive me if I'm
repeating some other fogey's much earlier remarks.

_Bad History_
by Barrett Watten

Atelos is pleased to announce the publication of _Bad History_ by Barrett
Watten.


About the book:
        Postmodern American poetry can also be described as post Vietnam
War poetry, and with _Bad History_, Barrett Watten has written a prose poem
epic of the postmodern period. Begun on May 1, 1992 to mark the first
anniversary of the Gulf War, but reflecting on that engagement as an
extension of the Vietnam War, the book is addressed to a diverse array of
events that mark the long era of that latter war. So the title section of
_Bad History_ begins, "A bad event happened to me, but its having occurred
became even more complicated in my thinking about it.... Take the War, for
example; I no longer know for certain which war is meant.... It is always
'the era between two wars.' So there was a very long war before a period of
time in which that war had just been over for a very long time--even though
it took its place as immediately preceding that time. Then a very short war
called that very long time into question--because suddenly time became
something that had happened to me." Barrett Watten's powerful memoir of
events of our time is a book about the making of history; he reminds us
that history doesn't take place in vacancy; it happens to us.

About the author:
        Born in 1948, Barrett Watten came into prominence in the early 70s
with publication of his first book (_Opera--Works_) and the founding of his
highly influential magazine _This_ and This Press. _Opera--Works_, along with a
number of other previously published works, is included in his recently
published major collection, Frame (1971-1990), published by Sun & Moon
Press. In addition to _Bad History_, Watten is the author of two other long
poems, _Progress_ and _Under Erasure_, and a co-author of _Leningrad: American
Writers in the Soviet Union_. A collection of essays on modern and
contemporary poetics, _Total Syntax_, was published in 1984. He is the
co-editor of _Poetics Journal_, and he teaches modernism and cultural studies
at Wayne State University in Detroit.

About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is
devoted to publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges
the conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended
to isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and
curtail its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project
are commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and
so forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes; Bad
History is volume 2. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian and
Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Ree Hall.

Aren't the ancient categories of the "beautiful" vs. the "sublime" about
such "departures from paraphrase"?  The sublime - a conscious invocation of
the awful, the terrible, the awe-inspiring - the OBSCURE, in other words,
as opposed to the beautiful/harmonious. But the obscure is always contained
within a meaningful narrative - or threatening (dramatically) to break out
of containment.

This exciting "threat" is encapsulated in the poetry that strikes us the
hardest - the most powerful because so beyond paraphrase.  And yet the power
is not in the jettisoning of meaning but in the gradual ascent of meaning
toward - what? - revelation?  Which can take not only the form of some
suprarational image, but also the passionate condensation of the aphorism
or the proverb - reason, totally engaged.

Every poem should induce a paraphrase which is admittedly and utterly
inadequate to its original.  That's the "logical content" - only one
aspect, but a necessary one.  Even a poem which is only talking to itself
is still having a conversation - and that's what the "logic" of it gets
across.

And there must be a larger and deeper human conversation of which poems are
a formal expression and ornament.  A conversation which looks through
reputations and prestige (cf. whatever poetry bk reviews are in this week's
NY Times Bk Rev etc.) and reads in the light of the poetry of poetry of
the world of poetry of poetry... not in order to condemn or pufferize
but simply to read carefully, critically, humanly...  - henry Gould

Of ANAMORPHOSIS EISENHOWER:

"In the haunted fractal mirrow of Sam Truitt's sweeping and richly detailed
ANAMORPHOSIS EISENHOWER, Ike melts into shape (supreme head allied poets
elegiac). Here the rhythms arrive on "airborne chariots of JIVE," viz: "It
is not too late to trade in our lives / For a brand new set of steak
knifes." Go ahead: read this book."

--Charles Bernstein


"Sam Truitt gives "mouth to outh resuscitation" to the ancient quest poem
as he writes "to voyage is to become / Hysterical." In the maximal
narrative loop of this book, Marilyn Monroe's skirt is perpetually going
"whoosh" in an Eistenian vacuum where "the displacement of the figure is
the form."

--Peter Gizzi


"If modernism wanted to conclude in minimalist perfections, the new age
might be said to begin with a shattered crystals shards. Sam Truitt has
assembled here a gorgeous trembling maximalism invested with erudition,
tenderness, with a shimmering full deck, wild card and all: "Bright rapture
in this dead town bounds like a rose / Among the broken bottles of a
freight yard."

--Ann Lauterbach

there's so much =experimental= work, however, that seems to deaden, rather
than enliven, visceral and/or emotional response.  to have some kind of
kinesthetic experience of the poem...or spirit-engaging experience of the
poem...it seems necessary to offer the reader some stimulation in these areas.

domain, which seems to me a different =landscape= than the visceral/emotional
domains.  of course, there are always exceptions; certainly, a
cerebral/intellectual experience can ultimately generate a visceral/emotional
experience...but not usually, as far as my own experience goes.  making such
distinctions between mind, body and spirit is risky and perhaps folly.
however, there's so much work out there that just leaves me passionless,
intellectually numbed, and aesthetically bored.  it seems to happen when the
work is so incredibly =private= that i can't find any place in it to grab on
to, or become engaged.  it's not that i require total =absorption= in the
work...i don't want all my responses packaged up for me, as if i were buying a

A lot of dissonance about the paraphrasable part of poetry shuttling
around already -- so -- to go along with Charles A, no, it's probably not
a beautiful idea to rank poems as you read (viz. The Top 500 Poems from
Columbia U Press -- which to be fair to Edith Hazen and what's his last
name Nick the new Granger's guy is only an index of the most frequently
anthologized poems). But Charles, I don't understand why compare Hardy
favorably to Pound in order to dismiss Hardy.

There's a footnote in _Works & Days_, Bill Luoma's new book, in which he
offers a reasonable working model for piecing out the meaning of
non-syntactical work. By meaning I'm jogging alongside Dave baratier (I
think) who seemed to be suggesting that the experience of the poem (the
paths of meanings? not merely prose straightahead meaning delivery units
but the sound, and now ((print & after)) the visual, and of course the
affect -- Aviva sometimes it can be difficult to locate the affect of
non-syntactical work and sometimes it isn't there but take heart!
sometimes it is viz. Tender Buttons, Solution Passage, When the Sun Tries
to Go on, etc) the experience of the poem is the thing. Ha. Well not the
thing but what you want the iodine or other marker to indicate. Is this
poem really necessary? Not that anyone needs to think they're in a
rationed situation, equities up 20% last year and the year before etc.
Coff. Coff.

All right, to come back to a coherent prose style for just a few lines.
Henry noted that the sublime was an attempt to escape the paraphrasable.
Yes, but in this transcendental scheme, all one would need to paraphrase
the sublime is a marker, say, an asymptote. The speaker of the poem,
having surveyed the activity in the hillsides and on the avenues, ascends
into a swoon i.e. collapses. Ron Padgett's poem A Man Saw A Ball of Gold:
"Aye, it was a ball of gold" is it seems to me a parody of this idea that
the sublime cannot be described or written, or at least a parody of
conventional ideas of the sublime. So, to try to say something without
invoking the Whitman Self-Contradiction Clause, it sounds as though the
issue at hand for the evaluators of poetry is how to acknowledge the
various ways a poem (a work?) can be beautiful (give the reader a
feeling?) without putting too much emphasis on anything that would lead
people to assume that the thing to do to give people feelings (be
beautiful?) is to imitate the going style.

Of course we all know that jose feliciano is not Homer and feelings have
already been replaced on the oldies stations by theories. Feelings you
could substitute something else maybe, ideas? So long, objective
correlative! Take care, melopoeia! Arrivaderci, projective verse. No ideas
in things either.

Jonathan Skinner's fascinating entry on "grace" in Transcendental Friend
speaks to some of these "critical" issues (ie. what makes a poem
beautiful, how do poems win us over without becoming purely intelligible,
"semantic objects" and all that).  Aviva is right too that it has something
to do with poetry being more than some kind of disembodied verbal solitaire.

always imagined machine guns figuring in that image, myself.

Esthetique du Mal was always my fav long Stevens.  I was delighted one day
to look in the excecrable H. Vendler's book on Stevens (largely on his
long things, I believe) and discover that she hates it, and didn't give it
any space; a dismissive sentence or two.  (That's my memory, anyway) It's
nice to have one's judgments confirmed!

Don't worry, Harry - it's not you.  Whenever Jordan writes in I try to
respond in the same style.  & whenever I write in Jordan tries to respond
as himself.  So there are really 2 Jordans, the original and the copy.
This is also the origin of the subplot, for all you Shakespeareans out
there. Put that in your sub-poetics & quibble! - Harry G.

As always, I have to retreive the stuff from my home, which is not where I
have internet access; this is a pain in the neck

Essentially it is *just one sentence* , Mark, at the beginng of one of
your contributions.

You pretty much echo what Martin has been saying.  I think you do it just
to establish continuity and flow; and yes I'm pretty well aware that the
basic burden of your replies throughout the colloquium are *in opposition*
to what Martin several times says, about poets wanting to be obscure.
That's why that one sentence jolts a bit.  No doubt I misread it, and
didn't make enuff allowences for context.  But that's how I remember it,
and I'll be able to respond to you tomorrow, when it's possible to have
the thing in hand.

Let me repeat that your contributions to the exchange are superb and I
hope people do look at it.

It's pretty much Martin who is pushing this quaint idea; I just felt I
shouldn't let you off the hook! given that I believed that in one sentence
you sort of agreed with his statements.  We'll see if I was reading
carelessly. Probably.

I think the sentence I had in mind is indeed the one you allude to.  It
seemed to me that (in the context of Martin's comments) saying that "A-G"
poets have absorbed and carry with 'em a "pretension" that their work is
obscure...well, it sounded like what you meant was, that they imagine (and
want) their work to be obscure.  Now I'm getting a little closer to what's
going on....I believe that one sentence of yours could be clearer, and
that that's what we're both struggling over.

I suspect I made a dumb gaff, and should have just tarred S-P M. with that
brush...(albeit i think your sentence isn't clear--but that could well be
my stumbling, alone; not all that unusual!)

"It is not the business of poetry to be anything."  Being primarily
activity, poetry roils.  It should act mostly through dynamism.. It uses
words (phonemes, etc.) to hammer away at physical reality, to chip and
damage it into history.  **It should have no paraphraseable content**
Poetry doesn't like you, why should it care what you think about it? (Only
when it is so bad it's practically ceased to exist, can it be paraphrased)
The ear is it's medium, the ear and the contingent facts of history.  "The
function of poetry is to waste excess energy."

Nice piece by Charles Rosen in current NYRB on knee-jerk negative reactions
toavant-garde music which deals with many of the issues in this thread,
including the unfounded calumny that no-one wants to have anything to do
with that stuff.

Uses word "understanding" throughout.  In discussion of music, not poetry,
so explication (except in programmatic music -- here is where the white
swan dies, here is where the Titanic sinks) not relevant. "Understanding"
must be understood more broadly.

And a lot of other work too.

I cannot read, say, Susan Howe without feeling it in my bones.  But I

to apologize for any kind of misreading--that's the way things on this
list go, is it not?

        Here is the offending sentence, in context, from my piece with
Stephen-Paul Martin and Jeff Hansen:

        "It seems to me that one of the biggest and most commonly shared
pretentions of avant garde writers is that our work is difficult and/or
unreadable. But I think also that one of the biggest presumptions of more
mainstream writers (journalists, for instance) is that their work is easy
to understand.
        My own experience leads me to believe that many of the techniques
necessary to understand experimental literature can be taught, with about
three hours of close attention, to reasonably intelligent college students
who show any willingness to engage with such literature. Of course, if
you're not willing to give three hours of your whole life to try to
understand something, then your inability (or, let's be honest,
unwillingness) to understand it is your own fault, not mine."

        The first thing to say is that your post DID imply that the first
sentence formed the basic argument of my whole piece--no need to worry
that one anymore though, I take it as behind us. The second issue (and I
suppose it's important, to you and me anyway), is how to read the first
sentence, which I take it is what you took exception to.

        I think, from the vantage point of several years (we wrote the
piece in 1994), that sentence seems to me something of an overstatement,
although yes, it was written mainly as a way of finding a transition
between Stephen-Paul's section and my own. From my present vantage point,
I guess I have no proof how broad any assumption of "difficulty" is across
the avant garde--but I CAN give you reasons why it seemed to me so at the
time.

        Before I do that, I do also want to say that "difficulty" and
"obscurity" and "unreadability" do NOT seem to me interchangeable words.
I'm not against difficulty--I'm not even sure I'm against obscurity--but I
think I would stress that some types of "difficulty" in reading are not
such a bad thing, since a "difficult" text may in some cases simply mean a
text that needs close and complex attention, and I can't see any problem
with that. "Obscurity" I guess I would see as an attempt to make something
hard to understand simply in order to make it hard to understand, rather
than because the problems it raises are complex. That doesn't
seem a good thing to me, although I suppose I can imagine an
occasion when it might. "Unreadable" seems to me
another term--I take it usually as a text in which some part of the piece
can't be read (because the letters are covered up, say) as transparent
conveyors of meaning, and so another way of "reading" (often a way of
visually reading) becomes necessary.

        What Stephen-Paul speaks of is the pride that some individuals do
take in being able to read that which others claim they cannot read--and
take that as a point of pride too easily. He uses his graduate school
experience as an example, and talks about people who try to prove that
they are smart by proving that they can read "difficult" books. In my
experience, such a thing did happen all the time. Although I greatly
enjoyed much of my experience as a graduate student at UBuffalo,
pretensions about such matters were entirely common--that may not have
been true in your experience. There is, in graduate school (and outside?)
a fairly pervasive problem of jockeying for position on the subject of how
others perceive one's intelligence.

        There is, I think, too easy a leap from his claims about graduate
school to his claims about avant garde poets more generally, and I think,
because I was trying to make other points at the time, I didn't perhaps
deal with that issue in the detail it may have deserved. At the same time,
though, I do NOT think that it's an easy given that the community of
"avant
garde" poets all have a conception of their work as "easy to read,"
although some perhaps do. I think the problem continues to exist as a
problem--in a world in which claims about our elitism are thrown back at
us constantly, there is still a need to watch out that we don't succubm
too easily in believing in our own "difficulty" in the way that someone
like Eliot, for instance, did. Which is, I take it, one of the points
Stephen-Paul is trying to make.

        So I would agree with you that my first sentence in that dialogue
contains an assumption it can't quite prove. That is, it can't prove how
actually widespread the problem that Stephen-Paul raises--have we too
easily accepted a certain notion about difficulty?--and thankfully you for
one have not accepted such an assumption, and many others have not as
well. But I still think that sentence is right to the extent that I do
feel that the "pretension" it mentions does exist, and is one that needs
to be argued against, as opposed to being seen as a given. And the reason
I felt I needed to respond to your post in the first place was because the
rest of my piece does try to undermine the whole concept of "difficulty,"
but your post did not suggest that I had done so.

        Thanks for giving me this chance to elaborate--

        Mark Wallace

Thanks Jordan for mentioning Ron Padgett in this context.  I would say that
his collection "The Big Something" is making, as the book's title suggests,
a tart treat out of these topics of the sublime, meaning, understanding.
See for another example, the poem "Poem":

When I am dead and gone
they will say of me,
"We never could figure out
what he was talking about,
but it was clear that he
understood very well
that modernism is a branch
that was cut off decades ago."

This parody of interpretation feeds into Lyotard's discussion of the
sublime in his essay on "What is postmodernism?"  The end of Padgett's "Poem"
is a funny play on metaphor's of heigth and depth that rhetorical
discussions of the sublime rely heavily on.

Artists Books: A Critical Survey of the Literature by Stefan Klima


The first and only published guide to writings on artists books this
book contains five lucid essays and a carefully researched, thorough
bibliography. An important reference tool for anyone interested in
artists books.


*Stefan Klima's text is an invaluable resource for anyone wishing to
explore the development of critical debates on artists books. Beginning
with documentation from the late 1960s Klima carefully charts the
discussion of several central issues: the identity of artists books,
their disputed origins, and their current status. His summary of
debates is handled with the even-handedness of an outsider; he maps the
sometimes fractious and frequently contentious dialogues among
interested parties with scrupulous care. His bibliography is a
thoroughly useful guide to the critical and historical texts. It has
the advantage of being well focused on the topic and thus serves as an
essential point of departure for any student, librarian, critic, or
collector interested in pursuing the literature on artists books. A
welcome addition to a steadily growing body of works in the field.*

*Johanna Drucker.

Johanna Drucker is an artist, scholar and writer. She is the author of
The Century of Artists Books, The Alphabetic Labyrinth and The Visible
Word among many other books. She is an associate Professor at Yale
University.




Stefan Klima was born in Oldham, England. He has a degree in art and a
Ph.D in American Music. Currently Head of Fine and Performing Arts at
the Beverly Hills Public Library Stefan Klima has been an observer of
artists books since 1985. This is his first book.

The inaugural reading in a series sponsored by _Rain Taxi_ was held at the
Weinstein Gallery on West 46th St. in Minneapolis last night to a packed
house of over 50 people.  Sze began by reading the poem "Streamers" from
his last collection, _Archipelago_ (Copper Canyon Press), then read two new
sequences from his forthcoming (in the next few weeks, he told me) book,
_The Redshifting Web_ (which features new and selected poems from Sze, also
from Copper Canyon).  The crowd was energized, Sze read stunningly, with a
huge Chuck Close self-portrait behind him (the gallery had up an entire
show of Close self-portraits, maybe a dozen works in all--an amazing gem
for such a small gallery in the upper midwest!).  Summit brewery provided
free post-event ales.  A nice way to spend the Sunday night following the
In the Heart of the Beast Puppet & Mask Theater's 24th annual parade &
festival through the streets of Minneapolis.

I agree with what your saying says, but also said is something which we
can disagree with if remembering that it wasn't -always- this way, Dryden
was laureate, as was Southey, they did give it to heroes a few times upon
a time, nowadays however what a misfortune

Thanx for your long and precise response.   I don't think there's much to
add; you have indeed clarified almost everything I/we brought up
about the Central Park piece (...making some very helpful further
theoretical points in the process).  My only quibble (and it *is* very
small) is with your sentence:


 "I do NOT think that it's an easy given that the community of
"avant garde" poets all have a conception of their work as "easy to read,"
although some perhaps do."


..I don't think most of us have a conception of our work as "easy to
read," either!  But the difficulties are simply those of encountering any
interesting practice...(or they're on the same scale, rather): it isn't
"easy" to encounter a late Beethoven quartet for the first time; for some
people it isn't easy (on a number of levels) to encounter a Public Enemy
record for the first!  or a Munch painting or a Noh drama or...

This I take it is partly what you're getting at by differentiating the
terms difficult, obscure etc.  Ain't nothin' wrong (necessarily) with "not
being easy."  (No bawdy quips, please)

Thanx for the great exchange...

Interesting, though, that Rosen's construction of the avant-garde seems to stall
out somwhere in the 1960's: the grand-dads of Uptown serialism -- Babbitt,
Carter, et al. Interesting because one might add to the conflict he details --
i.e., between the composer-advocates of musical modernism and the administrators
and taste-makers who insist on a conservative understanding of the "classical"
repertoire -- an account of the very real conflicts between, variously, uptown
and downtown new music scenes, serialism and minimalism, "pure" Euro-derived "art
music" and jazz- and pop-influenced compositions. While I'd join Rosen in his
strenuous disagreement with the Lloyd Webber brother's contention that a small
handful of modernist "dictators" are ruining music for the rest of us folks, I
would point out that until very recently, in terms of access to educational
institutions, grants, commissions, etc., these late modernists have "kept out,"
relatively speaking, the work of our various Meredith Monks, Pauline Oliveroses,
Anthony Braxtons, Tony Conrads, etc.

This seems to have some bearing on the issues of difficulty and understanding
which prompted this thread, as what's at stake in various forms in these
composers' works is an understanding of difficulty, complexity, etc. -- generally
held to be measures of what's worthwhile in the experience of art -- which has
less to do with the listener's having acquired the requisite formal,
musicological training needed to parse or paraphrase a multiply-articulated,
historically-referential series of forms, and has more to do with a willingness
to deal with that aspect of the musical situation which is less susceptible to
paraphrase. For example, one of Tony Conrad's or Phill Niblock's long-duration
pieces gives up its secret fairly quickly: within the first two or three seconds,
you start to hear those difference tones and beats, and you "get it." The
question at that point is what one does with the remaining 45 minutes or so. Such
work thus seems to propose a value for in-time experience which tends to be
correspondingly absent in much late serialism.

What does this have to do with poetry? How far can one push the analogybetween
the avant-gardes of different arts? I'm not really sure there's an answer to such
questions, but as a means of pointing out the multiple degrees of difference
which might be at stake here -- "there's difficulty and then there's difficulty"
-- the musical situation as (mis)addressed in Rosen's article seemed an
interesting aside.

This all seems very relevant.  But the willingness to be open to difficulty -
can it be separated from the "training" of the ear to hear it?  The one leads
to the other and vice versa.

Isn't there a border between music and poetry which is not a border?  I mean
regarding the "music of ideas" in poetry and "musical ideas".  Poetry often
uses the semantic element (the various "messages") as a foil for a musical
development which has a perhaps inexpressible (un-paraphraseable)
or even different meaning.

Is there a parallel between the "workmanlike" poem (in the terms of J. Skinner'
s current "T. Friend" definition, carefully-put-together but lacking "grace")
and the making of purely conceptual art - I mean difficulty for its own sake,
tours-de-force, exercises, art-as-intellectual game... the one (workmanlike)
displays craft without grace; the other displays superlative craft (virtuosity)
without grace.  What is this mysterious grace that links the difficult and
the beautiful, the simple and the complex, the heart and the mind?

Different senses of misunderstanding come into play, especially when
"paraphrasable content" is the issue. I understand Creeley or Scalapino
pretty well; there's no problem here, though a paraphrase of "that they
were at the beach" would be pretty much beside the point. When people
says they don't understand such writing it means they don't understand the
*poetics*. The paraphrase wouldn't help them much.

Other kinds of difficulty: references one needs a detailed commentary to
explain.  There is an essay by Davenport on Olson--all these people were
recommending "The Kingfishers" to him, but it turned out noone knew what
any of the reference were to.  Noone knew who "Fernand" was.

Poems that you have to interpret the hell out of; that demand a sort of
hermeneutical approach, because of the density of the language. This is a
third category--Mallarme, Celan...

recently potes & poets was at the point of being
discontinued due to lack of funding and per-
sonal initiative, but a small source of income
for the press has been found and i would like to
announce that the press is soliciting manuscripts
for a new chapbook series.  potes & poets will however
no longer publish perfectbound books and will
probably phase out it's a.bacus series after the
year 2000.  since 1984, the press has published
43 perfectbound books (including 'the art of
practice: 45 contemporary poets') and 114 issues
of a.bacus (to date).  most of these are available
through small press distribution.

the chapbooks will feature new and younger writers,
and will place special emphasis on experimental
texts, collaborations, and writings by women.
manuscripts are being solicited at this point and
should be chapbook-length, challenging the
boundaries of language (in all the senses of that
word) and visual format.

email me for further information at potepoet@home.com.
send manuscripts to: peter ganick, potes & poets press,

Friday, May 1, Rachel Levitsky and I drove down to the University of Denver
to hear Lyn Hejinian show a film, give a talk, and read some poems.  We also
gorged ourselves on mussels and bouillabaise at a very nice French
restaurant -- but that+s another story.

Present at one or both portions of the event: moderator Cole Swensen, Bin
Ramke, Rikki Ducornet, Mark Irwin, Beth Nugent, Jack Collom, Jennifer Heath,
Michael Friedman, Anselm Hollo, Andrew Schelling, Bobbie Hawkins, Laura
Mullen, Cedar Sigo and Jeni Olin.  And a raft of grad students.

The film -- "Letters Not About Love" -- is remarkable. Directed by Jacki
Ochs (incidentally, sister to Hejinian+s husband Larry Ochs, who himself
provided a very powerful and haunting jazz score), it concerns itself with
an exchange of letters between Hejinian and Russian poet Arkadii
Dragomeschenko (sic) from 1988-1993.  Ochs asked the poets to shape their
correspondence around a set of words -- Home, Grandmother, Neighbor,
Poverty, Book, Work, Violence, Window -- which she gave them.  The results
form a sustained dialogue/meditation on two cultures, two idioms, and
ultimately, the nature of dialogue and language itself.

As the poets+ conversation progresses, it underscores the way language both
encodes against loss, in a very daily and personal way -- the loss of a
sense of place, the loss of memory, of the quotidian -- and is vulnerable
itself to loss, to slippage.  The letter figures both as a method of
communication that creates its own self-contained and ongoing continuum and
a form of expression anxious about its existence, about the sense of
dislocation, physical and emotional, that the act of writing letters has
always sought to overcome.

Throughout, the richness of Jacki Ochs stream of visual images, combined
with the music of Larry Ochs, provides a continual counterpoint, adding
additional layers of "language" to the spoken words (read by the actress
Lili Taylor  -- Lyn said that Jacki thought her voice too "girlish" - and
dialect coach Viktor Hurd).

Afterwards, some of the discussion of the film (both public and private)
focused on the erotics of letter writing: on the subtle tensions that
pre-inhabit the word and guide it; on the richness and power of
letter-writing as a genre, a genre too often relegated to the ghettoized
status of "women+s writing." Hejinian spoke about "negotiating the gulf
between words and things -- not to fill it [that gulf] -- but to enter it,
as a realm of possibility -- a poetics of possibility..." An old White
Russian woman who first read Arkadii+s letters for her warned her that he
was a demon and wanted to possess her soul.  And Lyn quoted Shklovsky: "the
role of art is to kill pessimism."

"Letters Not About Love" is, of course, precisely and ironically about love
-- about the eros of logos. And the logos of eros. It has been screened at a
number of film festivals, received at least one award, but at present lacks
a distributor. Lyn remarked that exhibitors were nervous about its "lack of
an ending." (Haven't they read "The Rejection of Closure"?)

***

In the evening, Hejinian began her reading with a selection of twelve poems
from "Oxhota" -- the section based on expatriate jazz musician Steve Lacy+s
list of the 12 components of the Russian soul: Betrayal, Death, Conspiracy,
Truth, etc., which Lyn says got a good laugh from her Russian friends.

This was followed by new work -- an appropriately sprightly and altogether
enchanting poem called "Happily," a meditation on chance, sequence and
agency:

"Is happiness the name for our involuntary complicity with chance?"

She closed the evening with a long portion from "A Border Comedy"
(forthcoming soon from Sun & Moon).  She described the genesis of this work
as having arisen from her collaboration with Jack Collom in "Wicker," which
having enjoyed so much she attempted to try on her own -- a kind of
self-collaboration where a line would be written, then put away to undergo
some form of effacement -- and then added on to as if written by another.

"However lively the imagination it still benefits from contact with
reality."

"But a man doesn+t dump his mother in a horsepond just because it starts to
rain."

Thanks Jordan. In short, an important piece flares large (insert here)
things into question without specifically weighing itself down in the
concept that it intends to do such and such. If enough folks get
something from the piece, or enough folks who become well known cite it
as an influence-- then voila-- you have the next Homer of our
baseballish generative socio-economic understanding.

I read some Tony Hoagland stuff the other day and was reminded of another
peeve I have...flat, prosaic language ambling its way toward embarassingly
mundane "epiphany."  Obviously, it's not just certain "experimental" poems
that "deaden."

*** 12 names too many, German court rules

An attempt by a German mother to give her 10-month-old baby son 12
forenames was blocked Monday by a court which ruled that a child
could only have a maximum of five names. The 27-year-old housewife
wanted to name the boy Chenekwahow Migiskau Nikapi-Hun-Nizeo
Alessandro Majim Chayara Inti Ernesto Prithibi Kioma Pathar Henrike
so that he would grow up "in the cultural spirit of the times." But
the Duesseldorf court said that in choosing the names the mother,
whom it did not name, had not fulfilled her
"Vornamenbestimmungspflicht" - an obligation to make clear what
people should call her child. See

FOR RELEASE: May 1, 1998

Caliban and Sycorax: Astronomers propose names for their two recently
discovered icy moons of Uranus

ITHACA, N.Y.-Cornell University astronomer Philip Nicholson and his
colleagues have proposed names for the two recently discovered moons of
the planet Uranus. They are Caliban and Sycorax, both characters in
Shakespeare's play "The Tempest." The names are likely to be approved by
the International Astronomical Union.

The astronomers detail their discovery of the two moons in a report in
the April 30 issue of the magazine Nature. They confirm that Caliban and
Sycorax are the faintest planetary moons yet imaged by ground-based
telescopes. The discovery of the two moons was reported on Oct. 31 by
Nicholson and colleagues Joseph Burns, professor of engineering and
astronomy at Cornell, Brett Gladman of the Canadian Institute for
Theoretical Physics at the University of Toronto, and J.J. Kavelaars of
McMaster University, Canada.

The team used light-sensitive semiconductors, called charge-coupled
devices, attached to the 5-meter Hale telescope on Mount Palomar,
Calif., to track the irregular, or non-circular, orbits of the two
moons. Regular satellites orbit near a planet's equatorial plane. The
two moons are the first irregular satellites discovered around Uranus.

Both Caliban and Sycorax, the astronomers write, are unusually red in
color, which suggests a link with the recently discovered populations of
comet-like bodies called trans-Neptunian objects, which orbit the sun
beyond the orbit of Neptune, and Centaurs, which cross the orbits of the
outer planets.

Both trans-Neptunians and Centaurs, say the researchers, have a wide
range of reddish colors, perhaps resulting from the bombardment of their
organic-rich icy surfaces. Nicholson says this bombardment could be from
cosmic rays or from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. The methane on the
moons' surfaces, he says, would be "cooked" by the radiation into
hydrocarbons, showing up as a dark red through a telescope's filters.

The two moons, say the researchers, are presumed to have been captured
by Uranus early in the history of the solar system. "My guess is that
the moons were once trans-Neptunians and they became Centaurs and were
captured by Uranus and became satellites," says Nicholson. Since the
newly discovered moons are likely to have been captured by Uranus soon
after its formation, the Nature article notes, "their physical
properties may provide clues to conditions in the early solar system."

The process of capture could have taken two forms, Nicholson says. The
moons could have been trapped by Uranus gravity as they came close to
the planet.  Another theory, he says, is that in the early days of the
solar system Uranus might have been surrounded by a gaseous nebula that
would have caused a drag on the objects' movement as they came close to
the planet.

Nicholson estimates that Caliban, the smaller of the two moons, has a
diameter of 60 kilometers (37 miles) and is orbiting Uranus at an
average distance of about 7.2 million kilometers (4.5 million miles),
taking 1.6 years to complete one revolution. Sycorax, he estimates, has
a diameter of 120 kilometers (74.5 miles) and takes 3.5 years to
complete one orbit of Uranus at a mean distance of about 12.2 million
kilometers (7.5 million miles) from the planet. However, he says,
Sycorax has a much more elliptical orbit than Caliban, bringing it as
close as 6 million kilometers (3.7 million miles) to the planet.

The composition of the two moons, says Nicholson, "is probably a
plum-pudding mixture of rocks and ice."

All 15 previously known satellites of Uranus lie on fairly evenly
spaced, nearly circular orbits. Most recently Voyager 2, in 1985 and
1986, discovered 10 small, dark inner moons.

Jupiter has eight known irregular satellites, of which the last, Leda,
was discovered in 1974. Saturn has one, Phoebe, discovered in 1898, and
Neptune has one, Nereid, discovered in 1949.

Mark:

I find the above statement intriguing, and I was hoping you
could elaborate, particularly since I'm planning to teach from _Poems
for the Millennium_. What are those reading techniques necessary to
understanding experimental literature? How do you teach them? How
would they be different from "techniques" applied to understanding
"non-experimental" work? Are such techniques a sufficient means for
having an "understanding" of "experimental" poems? And if they're
not sufficient (I assume you wouldn't think they are?) would you see
them, even, as _what is most important_ to understanding?

These techniques, do they equally work for Celan as for
Berssenbrugge? For Zukofsky as for Spicer? For Bracho as for Mac Low?
Some techniques for some writers and not for others? For some works
and not for others?

Too many questions, but I'm asking because I frankly don't feel like
I employ any particular technique when I read the above writers, nor
do I necessarily ever feel like I "understand" them, since any sense
of understanding I gain of the poetry I most admire is always sliding
and shifting. I've always felt fairly OK with this, but your position
would imply that I, for one, didn't learn what I could have
learned. And it would have only taken me three hours! ("Well, shit,"
as Elizabeth Barret Browning says somewhere in  _Sonnets from the
Portuguese_... )

It might just be that I'm not understanding your sense of the tricky
term. But when you teach experimental literature, what is it you
would like your students to "understand"?

really curious,
Kent

Hello. I poet friend of mine is looking for a summer sub-let in NYC
(Manhatt... 2nd choice Brooklyn...).

He wants to pay between $600 and $900. He'll be living with his
girlfriend--and is hoping for a place that would allow a cat. A studio, 1
bedroom, or 2 bedroom would be fine.

Please e-mail me with any possibilities for him...

Thanks,
Katy

(Something weird's happened to my out box, but it doesn't seem as if this
went out.  Sorry if this is a duplication.)

Taylor Brady's right that Charles Rosen is thinking strictly along "uptown"
lines, but, hey, what would you expect from a concert pianist who wrote THE
book on sonata form.  It's not like he hangs out at Roulette or the
Knitting Factory.

Brady goes on to write:

> For example, one of Tony Conrad's or Phill Niblock's long-duration pieces

Actually I think Niblock's music takes substantially longer that a few
seconds to "get," though that may be all it takes to learn the vocabulary
he's using.  Once you've tuned into the beating & difference tones, each of
his works has a distinctive shape of tension & release, built entirely from
these basic elements.  The structure of the beat patterns are the musical
form of each of his works.  If you're aren't "getting it" this larger
structure, I'm not sure why you'd want to bother staying in a room with it
playing, unless drones are just your thing.

Of course, the real way to hear his music is in the full Music and Film
installation (on solstices at Experimental Intermedia in NY or frequently
touring to odd art spaces around the world) - many hours of two or three
films (gorgeously shot footage of people working usually, though there's
one of a series of sunsets, and a few others) shown simultaneously while
one piece of music after another is played much louder than you would at
home, giving the sound a very physical feel. The music becomes something
you're walking in the midst of, rather than simply hearing.

Conrad's music seems to me to be less about this kind of spatial thing &
more just about the simple, small number, pitch ratios of just intonation
and how dissonance can work within that system.  Niblock's intervals won't
resolve to small number ratios in this way, the pitches are much too
closely packed (often only one or two cycles per second apart).

>>multiple degrees of difference which might be at stake here -- "there's
>difficulty and then there's difficulty" >-- the musical situation as
>(mis)addressed in Rosen's article seemed an interesting aside.

Rosen's conclusion is that the growing lack of general music education
(and, hence, the decrease in amateur musicians who understand performance
issues) combined with the dwindling number of people who hear classical
music performed live rather than on recordings is the cause for the decline
in interest in all classical music, not just the avant garde.

I'm not sure the situation with "avant garde" poetry is the same.  There's
certainly a lot more talk about the growth of general interest in reading,
writing, & performing poetry & I don't see this having a lot of impact one
way or another on "avant garde" writing.

I still think people need to be taught that art is NOT always immediately
discernable, that there's often a lot of poking around to be done.  People
aren't any more or less stupid than artists, but non-artists rarely learn
how to think about non-normative art in a way that's useful to them.  The
standard dozen or twenty questions folks are taught to deal with literary
texts will work for a lot of things, but I don't think they're much help
with, say, Bruce Andrews or Susan Howe.

Bests,

Herb

More on difficulty, technique, etc:

I am with Kent on this one; while it might be true that some difficulty is
exaggerated and that one can teach clever students to read "difficult"
texts quite easily in some cases, my own experience points to something
quite different:

In some cases I have taken years to learn to read certain poets, while
other times I encounter no resistance (in myself) at all. I have to be
ready as a reader for a certain poet. I still don't *get* Olson, I
confess. Spicer took me quite a while. This is a lifelong process, is my
point.

Of course, I never had much help with most of this when I really needed
it. If I had been lucky to have an intelligent teacher in college I might
have caught on sooner.

But maybe we are talking about two different things.  The sort of
superficial obstacles that impede initial engagement vs. the prolonged
difficulties caused by our own internal resistances to certain kinds of
texts.

Any thoughts?

Reading poetry? (careful there, it can toast your eyeballs!)

That's a lifelong evolution as you say in your post.

The discovery principle is best but takes gads of time.

This reader just isn't convinced of the essentiality of poetics for the reader
as such. Poetics, wonderful as it is, can certainly lead one to discover new
poems/poets, but why must a poetics necessarily be defined that shows the
reader the idiocy of his/her reading ways?

The reader's background and articulation, defense of position (and faith?) is
to be considered, no?

How much poetics is written for the "pure" reader (if such a one exists).

The poetics trend now: poetics valorizes (and polarizes?) the poet.

One usually sees the relationship of the poem to the poetics not as being onto
but into, which leaves the reader to make assumptions about connections that
were never intended by the author.

An oblique perspective on the issue would come from looking at peots who are
intentionally difficult and reasons why this might be.  I'm sure that there
are others who are difficult because they are difficult people.  I know this
applies to me - there are many who would attest to this.  Some are difficult
out of pretention - I may be guilty of this.  But I do think there are
legitimate artistic reasons for "being difficult".

Here is the first stanza from a poem in J. Ashbery's new collection:

Within a windowed niche of that high hall
I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day.
I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night.
Come, Sheperd, and again renew the quest.
_And birds sit brooding in the snow.__

Line six is from Henry the V, and the others shouldn't be too hard to find

In addition to Kent Johnson's questions about how one teaches students to

understanding "difficult" texts-- to what ends do you teach "difficult"
texts?  So they can write that way too?  So that they have the option of
writing that way?  So that teachers who are interested in "difficult" texts

More specifically, what good is teaching "understanding" to literary

What good is literary production without understanding?

When I was in school interpreting texts and interpreting reality in class
discussion went hand in hand.  The parable is the simplest form of what
these poems, novels, plays were about - putting a frame on reality, on
experience, in order to interpret what it meant.  What was beautiful or
moving or ugly or powerful or paradoxical or confrontational was what
the literary work expressed - the process of reading was a process of trying
to understand where the author was going with this story - what meanings
did it emphasize or point toward.

Do they still do this in school?

In this context "difficulty" for its own sake is pretty meaningless.  The
basic technique of irony is to weed out false or superficial readings of
reality.  An author presents a character or characters in a golden light
- until you read between the lines.  This is a kind of difficult writing.
A poet may want to wrap his or her kernel of meanings or revelations in
a number of layers of difficulty simply to emphasize how powerful or
precious they are, how threatened by cliche.  But difficulty for its own
sake?  That kind of difficulty is maybe not for its own sake but for the sake
of a cult or subculture of readers who ingest meaningless difficulty for the
sake of renouncing the world and joining the club.  This is not to say
that writing itself is easy or that a writer will never take on various
degrees of difficulty just for the sake of the challenge or that a writer
will never risk plunging into obscurity or that a writer will never lose
command of the medium or that plenty of great writing is just stupendously
difficult or that difficulty is bad or that obscurity is bad or that
my own poems are accessible, far from it. - Henry Gould

It sounds as though we are in a rethink time in regard to the teaching of
poetry. I would like to say something provocative about the necessity of
teaching the history of contemporary American poetry, but it sounds too
smugly perverse to me to fill out that form with the last moments of my
lunch break. So -- why teach difficult poetry? Difficulty's relative,
right? That, I think, is what Mark was getting at -- sure, poetry can be
hard to read, try the newspapers, they're worse. It used to be a sign of
brain damage in New York City if you failed to read the Times every day --
now it's more likely you're a conscientious objector, complaining to
someone about the irony on NPR. People teach what they read, or what they
want to read, or so they tell me. Why grandstand?

anyway, anybody else have a look at Brian Kim Stefans' new site,

I didn't think I did that. did I do that? didn't mean to do that. I was
just recalling an old exercise from a class when I was an undergraduate,
looking at the Pound poem for Swinburne and the Hardy one (the titles don't
come to mind right now) from various viewpoints with the question to find
the 'better' poem. According to the various criteria, it was the Hardy poem
-- the Pound poem is one of his earlier efforts, and does seem a bit
overdone. But I hope I didn't then turn around and dismiss  Hardy. I
wouldn't consciously do that. I like Hardy's work a lot -- poems and prose.
I don't have my post at hand, but I apologize for giving you the thought
that I was dismissing Hardy.

This doesn't really address your query, Elizabeth. Just some random
blathering:

The argument traditionally offered about difficulty is that the pleasure
yielded exists in exact proportion to the effort exerted in obtaining
"understanding" or clarity. I find this still to be true even if the text in
question is no longer one that can be read by the old & familiar
hermeneutical strategies. The goal, though, is no longer "clarity" i.e. a
way to paraphrase content. It is rather to stand in a whole new relation to
form and to language itself. (Hejinian: "the poetics of possibility"). To
interpret a text is only one way to relate to it.  A "difficult" text that
defies or mocks those strategies invites a different way to relate to it. A
different way _into_ language.

The kind of postmodern texts under discussion here (pick a card, any card)
aren't merely opaque or obscure. They call into question the whole idea of
relating to texts that way.  Difficult then becomes (as with the modernists)
a synonym for the New. How difficult -or weird- was E=mc2 in its day?  The
reason I guess I use that example is that it offers a new model of
relatedness, of the possibilities for relating, and I think that radical new
forms of language must perform the same task. So, teaching Stein's "Stanzas"
in an Intro to Poetry class alongside of Sandburg's "The Grass" (instead of
just Sandburg) would offer a student alternate models for thinking about
relatedness, networks of words, the construction of meaning (or its lack),
and the way, above all, that language set in motion tends to _play_. This is
not difficult but exciting. (Memo to self: compare rise of Dr. J, Connie
Hawkins-style b-ball in 70's with emergence of LangPo). (Second memo to
self: include effects of Title IX vis-a-vis women's sports).

Everything risable must diverge,

One way I sometimes cope with texts in which I have difficulty
understanding the poetics at work is to try imitating them.  I think this
method can sometimes work (for some students...) in the classroom...It's a
way of talking about texts without first talking about meaning.
Unfortunately, I find that students are often able to do fine imitations
but then aren't able to take the next step and intellectualize the
process.For example, in their imitation they may pick up that a poet is juxtaposing
diction/tone but they won't be able to verbalize what the effect of this
juxtaposition is or even that juxtaposition is happening.

A few of the posts on teaching and understanding difficulty have been
putting these words in quotation marks-- "difficulty"  "understanding"--
which serves a variety of rhetorical purposes.  I have found that in the
classroom, students are not sometimes aware of the range of uses to
which the terms of the conversation are being put.  Sometimes it may
be useful to pause and gather some the usages/meanings in play for the
same word.  A brainstorming session in which a word like "difficult" is
defined in several ways, maybe even to generate a list of meanings-in-play,
can be very useful.  We put on the table all the tautologies, cliches,
comparisons, synonyms, antonyms, exceptions, generalizations, etc. that
we can think of, then "step back" a second to see what has accumulated.
The brainstorming works best in my experience if it is applied to word
both in its classroom context (i.e. with respect to poetry or whatever)
and in other everyday or specialized contexts ostensibly unrelated to
the subject at hand (poetry or whatever).  This kind of exercise
can make visible the way in which a group together is trying to fashion
or appropriate a jargon of tribal intersubjectivity.

A few thoughts on difficulty & technique. To me, difficulty is a kind of
prerequisite to possibility.  That the poem might be more than a handshake
between writer & reader.  Rather, elaborate hand-signals, or palm slapping
games which writer begins, reader modifies, etc.  Technique, then,
proposes parameters for play. What is a game?  In part an admission that
Connor O'Tation might, under the reader's foster care, grow up, get a
sex-change, and change his/her name to Dee Notation.  But also a
taking-advantage of the democratic possibilities of that fact, that bit of
fate.  Similarly a joke: never the joke's on you or me, but, the joke's on
us.  Any static between interpretation and intention is less like scraping
friction and more an issue of distance between radio and signal, *space*
being the variable and deciding factor between noise and reception: music
becomes a matter of moving on, adjusting the dial, directional guesswork.
Difficulty, then, is related to poetry's potential agency, its ability to
affect, set in unanticipated motion, an audience: the difference between
"eating that fig newton changed my life" and "eating that wrench changed
my life" is what I have in mind.  Let there be a few wrenches between the
participants, I say, a series of necessary adjustments, in the getting
there.

        I just finished teaching a course called "Gender Sexuality and
Literature" using mostly poetry (The Odyssey, Sappho, Walt Whitman, HD's
Helen in Egypt, Stein's Tender Buttons, Ginsberg's Howl & Other Poems,
Niedecker's Granite Pail and Harryette Mullen's Muse and Drudge).
        Why Stein? Why also Mullen's work? (which isn't exactly "easy" the
same way "Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening" is {allegedly} easy).
        1) I wanted to introduce the idea of l'ecriture feminine into this
class, which consisted of 50% women's studies majors w/ at least as solid
a grasp of Cixous, Kristeva, et.al. as I have and
        2) I wanted to re-emphasize the point that "reading" is often in
improvisational activity, and not something to be performed unconsciously
(when I read a newspaper, I'm not conscious that I'm reading, but when I'm
reading Tender Buttons, I know)
        The objective was not "to teach students to write that way" though
one of the ways into Stein's work was imitation (Tender Buttonesque
passages on objects in the room: a map, a pretzel, a hockey puck). Nor was
it so I could avoid talking about set pieces. My main objective was to
show that there are different ways of relating to language. The
experience was unsettling at first (throughout, for some students), but
with the help of Judy Grahn's pointers found in her book _Really Reading
Gertrude Stein_, most of the students seemed to get the idea that it was
possible to read a work without being expected to find some final,
terminal meaning. Judy Grahn, in fact, says that her big revelation into
how to read Gertrude Stein occured when she quit asking why is GS so
difficult and realized that she (Grahn) is the one who is being difficult
by expecting Gertrude Stein to do things that Gertrude Stein just doesn't
do.
        Above all, Stein's work (as well as HD's) opened the students to
Harryette Mullen's great volume -- rather than worrying about "what does
this poem MEAN" the students spent every class period devoted to her work
talking about all the great things she DOES. And I do mean the students: I
had to do very little talking. Students found meaning in Muse and Drudge,
and they got at that meaning in spite of the difficulties posed by the
poem. In short, I find that most students come to college looking at
poems the same way they look at algebra problems. They exist to be
(re)solved. I introduced difficult poetry to show students that poetry and
language in general functions quite different from the ways they have been
conditioned to believe.
        I have no idea if I succeeded, and I won't know whether the
students really liked stein or mullen until I see the evaluations (I asked
the class to rank and comment on the work). But at least some of the class
discussions were lively in ways they woudn't have been if I stuck w/
anthology favorites.

I've had a very similar exerience w/ M & D as well as with Tender Buttons.
Once you sell your students on a different model of reading (the hard
part) they have great things to say about these works, things I would
never have thought of - so it's not just that you convince them that they
don't have to make meaning (i.e. that they should absorb difficult texts
out of some sense that they're chic or simply b/c you told them to) - on
the contrary, they make a load of meaning once you get them started.
        I think we sometimes sell students short in this regard - I taught
Bob Perelman's "A Literal Translation of Virgil's 4th Ecologue" to my
Haverford students this semester expecting a fair amount of reistence
(bracing for it w/ extra preparation etc) and found that they considered
it both hilariously funny and intellectually serious, and discussed it
accordingly.  A nice surprise for me to be sure.   -m.

It sounds like an interesting class, David - but does it make sense to set
up a dichotomy between (fun) doing and (boring) meaning?  It's the old
purloined letter trick, or hiding something in plain sight, isn't it?
The Stein text still has "meanings" - and your students found them: in
the surface playing with words as building blocks (I'm simplifying).
Why reinforce these oppositions between old/new, doing/meaning?  Like
M. Magee suggested, there's pleasure in the hunt. These issues have
been around forever - the Puritans reading for instruction only vs.
all those wicked novels etc.  But you do pay a price for excluding
the effort to summarize, contextualize, respond to the meaning-

the opposing danger is more prevalent (slogging after the moral of the

Hi Henry: any dichotomy i established was unintentional, more the result
of following this thread (fun) at the same time i'm supposed to be
completing some rather bureaucratic obligations (boring), and thus i
rushed something that probably required more thought. I didn't mean to
diss robert frost, either, but only to point out that it seems to take
different approaches to read Mullen and Stein than it does to read the
canonical guys. Anyway, thanks for helping to clarify the stuff that i
muddled in my hasty composition.

Emerging from deep lurk. . .

One version of the obvious:  I think students get nervous about (some)
poetries as they've had 15 years of testing. . . (Testing --> testy)
Indeed, at the very moment we're celebrating difficulty, they're taking 3
or 4 or 5 other classes, in which difficulty is something to be
overcome...and fast.  Let's be fair: one can stand at the front of the room
(or even sit in the circle) and preach the joys of openness to new
strategies of reading and writing, but everyone knows that sooner or later,
wham-o, evaluation-time, grades, "remarks,". . . a meditation on your
contribution, yuk, blah.  Why should they believe us? And even if they do,
its a tough go to unlearn 10 years or so of reading and writing about books
as if they were tiny knowledge-nuggets.

It's not difficulty per se that is the problem. . . I can convince my
students of the legitimacy of unique "languages" "styles" "rhetorical
strategies" "traditions". . . oftentimes by just looking around the room
and noting different approaches to dress, attitudes towards schooling,
tastes in music, ways of speaking, etc.  It's culture, right?  The
difficulty, er, is difficulty within a process of certification.
Difficulty as commodity.  Difficulty within a system of education that
isn't so much about education as it is about the conferring of some odd
authority.. . . Booga booga. You've got it. Go in peace.

Resist. . .teach more poetry.

Nice (oppositional) viewpoints Henry. It seems that obscurity and difficulty
for its own sake is the unavoidable lot of this avant-garde fin-de-seicle: the
idea being in part to avoid absorption and subsequent diminution or
oversimplification by mass society. There are as you say other more *difficult*
, better and time honored means of doing this however. I think I understand
what you mean by "joining the club" as not being representative of poet-reader
relations, but rather poet-poet relations. I remember Octavio Paz talking of
the existence of a poet's "secret society" of readers in an interview with Mark
Strand. This enduring phrase speaks more about an economics of humanity, of the
reality of minority (individual) tastes over mass tastes, of election, and even
of luck. I assume that you are speaking of poets writing mainly for other
poets. Pablo Neruda once remarked that he had regretted this.


>What good is teaching "understanding" to literary production?

>What good is literary production without understanding?


It seems that the poetics of literary production have, unwittingly, fallen in
step with the times, with the techno paradigm of specialization, volume
production, the consumable or throw-away, etc.

Well that does it for me. Now I know I'm wanted for questioning by the party.
Maybe it's the camps for me. Sing a few bars of non nobis e te deum for me will

OK Sam, yes, you win, nec spe nec metu.  Babbling banalities.
The rule is, though, as I understand it, that poetry is a sort of
cosmological structure of increasing densities or destinies,
gradually approaching the moral-historical and reaching the fatal.
Thus the search for "completed meaning" or the "organic" structure
or wholeness of a work of art leads eventually to that transition
to complete absorption.  Something like what Mandelstam
meant about "the meaning of a poet's life becomes clear at the moment
of death".
Poets on the level of Vallejo, Akhmatova, Celan, Dickinson - absorbing
a life in its entirety.  (This is sort of naive illusion-
mongering, yet there's something to it.  Many are called, few are
chosen.) Who said "poetry is hero-worship"?  These greatest poets
cry out that life is wholeness, wholeness of meaning, completion,
fruition, attainment, ripeness, abundance.  There is no dialectic here,
as if poetry were a vacation from decision and meaning, a sort of
rebellion, a game for pampered children without consequence, a sophisticated
amorality.  How does that Rilke phrase go, something about at life's
foundations, chance does not exist.  What he means is we make a decision.
There are these levels in poetry, and the greatest poems leave nothing
to chance.  Form and content!!  Between the poet and the poem - both
setting their faces toward each other - form & content are caught in a
vise.  - Henry Gould

yes i think imitation helps and i think writing the poem out helps and
hearing the poem read or reading it aloud yourself or playing with
it(replacing the nouns replacing the verbs)or "translating" like Zukofsky
brodsky on frost makes it clear there's understanding and UNDERSTANDING.

"Modern science thus simply carries through in its methodology what
experience has always striven after. Experience is valid only if it is
confirmed; hence its dignity depends on its fundamental repeatability.
But this means that experience, by its very nature, abolishes its
history. This is true even of everyday experience, and how much more for
any scientific version of it. Thus it is not just a chance one-sided
emphasis of modern scientific theory, but has a foundation in fact, that
the theory of experience is related teleologically to the truth that is
derived fron it.

Thank you Henry for your thoughtful ballast.

What I was gunning to get down is that the poetic per se is outside of
technique---a runway (for models or airplanes and sometimes model
airplanes)----but rather a function of grace. As Aquinas pointed out grace
is not a function of effort, the "vice" clench. The wholeness you speak of
is there---is here--is present. The truer translation from new testament
you cite is not "few choosen" but "few choose to respond." But there's a
lot of choice in chance----4 out of 6 letters, those loaded dice. As a
critic once wrote artists put a frame around what is already there and say
"look." A kind of finger pointing, and not always a painted heaven viz
Sistine Chapel.  It's just not out there but here. As Rilke also wrote,
"where two heartways meet there stands no temple to Apollo."

Completely agree with you, Sam (but is that really so about the choose
rather than chosen?).  Once again the "grace" definition in Trans. Friend
is apropos (http://www.morningred.com/friend).  I just think the fatal quality
- the vise-grip of the poem - where every micro-syllable is exact and
unexpected and absolute - is also an effect of grace.  Grace is not only
liberation and release; it's the way, it's the ultimate.
The very aptitude for hard labor is a gift too. Girded. Awake and ready
to go. Ready to go very out to lunch.

Are the producers and the readers of poetry the same exact people? If so,
that would explain a certain emphasis on specialized technique and
poetics. The reader according to this model is either a) poet or other
artist, publisher etc  b) literary critic/professor or c) student. If grad
student then training to be (c) or already (a). If undergrad. fulfilling
misc. requirements in highly specialized areas unrelated to one another
and acquiring 'cultural capital' (P. Bourdieu).

Here is my crude sociological analysis, I welcome more refined ones:

"academic poetry"--the poetry of neo-conservative Eastern elites, ivy
league schools etc... Requires an educated reader, acculturated into this
elite class; "intellectual" but basically accepting of received notions of
aesthetics.  (Richard Howard, Anthony Hecht, James Merrill; the new
formalists).

"creative writing"--the poetry of the suburban, reasonably well-educated,
reasonably liberal, midwestern middle classes. The kind of people that

More, more, Jonathan!  the funny thing is there are no poets in any of
those categories.  Here's where the real poets are:

"byt poetry" - the poetry of "byt" (everyday life).  These poets are usually
either on the street or trying to get there.  Either in their minds or for
real.  Self-non-educated.  They started reacting poetically to experience
at a young age; this reaction has become second nature; you find them
at open mikes, bars, coffee houses, tenements.  Their poetry ranges from
the naive to the sophisticated, the vulgar to the learned, usually in
a presentation that involves some kind of exhibitionism.  Whitman and
King David are the great exemplars of this mode.  Most of the people
in the other sociological categories you mentioned consider byt poets
beneath contempt; but then, these people aren't poets.  This also
explains why the Muse is absent in America. Right. Ask Bob Holman.

Well ScoutEW, it is supposed to make you laugh, AND is supposed to be too
fucking much as well, in your eloquent phrase, so both goals are
accomplished. As for you Henry, I reject the category of real poet who
magically frees herself from all such factors.  A few more categories:

amateur poetry--the poetry of all my aunts, sisters, cousins, who have
published poetry. College educated on the whole, but not professionally
invested in the poetry world.  They publish in community college Literary
magazines; are part of the clientele for "creative writing," often in less
academic settings.  I know more women then men in this category but that
might just be my extended family.

poetry based on identity politics--this is a tricky category because it
overlaps with all the preceding ones. Cherrie Moraga was here the other
day and read an autobiographical narrative that stylistically was
identical to "creative writing" prose, with a few Spanish words thrown in.
Other identity poetry is amateur, from the sociological point of view. The
poetry of elite neo-conservative gay men, while not framed as "identity
politics" does express the habitus of an easily identifiable group.
Identity politics also intersects with language poetry...  I haven't
worked this out yet; I guess what I'm talking about is poetry that
expresses the aims of social movements in a fairly direct way.

I think I'm a little confused here about language poetry--

Didn't Palmer and Hejinian go to Harvard? Scalapino to an MA at Berkeley?
Watten a PhD at Berkeley?

And then there's Iowa... which at this point is basically an "academic
poetry" center (lots of Ivy-League etc...)... but is also in the
Midwest... with Marvin Bell still teaching here...

I would say that most of the students at Iowa study at one time or other
with a member of all of the categories being posted here (including the
spinster aunt...)

This is beating a terminally ill horse I guess, but this seems not even to
be at the level of caricature, not worked out indeed.  How in the world is
a Carla Harryman, a Bob Perelman, Hejinian, Bernstein, practicing
"identity politics"? however else one might define them as "language
poets."  Is the resolute refusal of a stable subject compatible with
identiy politics?  Not any brand I know of.  -m.

My aunts are not "spinsters," by the way; that is not a word I ever
use. Plus, the ones I am thinking of are married or divorced with
numerous offspring.  I find it curious that the word spinster somehow
insinuated itself into the discussion, through the cultural cliche
"spinster aunt."

Otherwise, thanks for all your corrections.

I believe it's Russian for "everyday life".  Viktoria Schweitzer has a
biography of Tsvetaeva titled something like "Byt i bytie" or
Everydayness and eternity.  Byt I think actually means something a
little stronger - drabness, ordinariness, mundane.,..  it's pronounced
sort of like "beat", appropriately.  I'm a proto-byt poet myself.

OED gives "byt" as the anglo-saxon term for
byte, a unit composed of 8 bits. the earliest
known ex. is in the compound "eyenbyt of
inwit", which refers to the processing speed
of the i586 precursor to our Pentium II chip.

I guess if "spinster" insinuated itself into the discussion as cultural
cliche (and I did do that insinuating) it's because the taxonomy as
presented seemed its own hodge-podge of cultural cliches, which is why,
I imagine, Erik Sweet was having such a laugh.

Jonathan's taxonomy is very amusing and also amusing are the other posts
it has provoked.  let me however object to his original premise, which
was that only "producers" "consume" poetry, i.e., the readers and writers
are the same.  or that you have to at least be in an academic context to
be reading poetry, of whatever ilk.

first, there are persons active in other arts who read poetry (I guess
that is analogous to academics in non-literary departments).  second,
there really are people who just read the stuff.  although (as K Koch
quotes somebody in the most recent NY Review) writing is an intense form
of reading, it is not necessary for all readers to write.  it is possible
to read poetry, including by living, contemporary poets, and not want or
need to write it yourself.  (it is true that in most civilizations there
has always been a large overlap between readers and writers of poetry,
and literature has always been disseminated partly through educational
systems, but the basic point is that there are others out there.)

its too early in the morning for this to be as clear as I would like it
to be, but let us not forget the non-writing reader.

Increasingly, I'm hearing from non-writing friends, acquaintances, and other
people (who I've crawled out of my deep winter hole to speak with) that they
read poetry.  A dancer I met at the local bookstore (she was buying a blank
book for a friend's birthday) listened to a conversation I was having with the
storeowner about various Szymborska translators.  At the point that I
mentioned my struggles with Rilke translations, she joined in by saying, "I
read Rilke almost every night last year.  I love his work.  I'm not sure what
my year would have been like if I'd not had Rilke."  This dancer is completely
immersed in her teaching and performing, and has nothing to do with the
"literary" world (in all its silly permutations), but simply read this poetry
of her own volition.  She was certainly not reading Rilke for help with her
writing craft, nor was she stimulated to read poetry by the people around her.
This is a single instance of the many conversations I've had with folks who
find their way to a poet (or poets) for personal, rather than "artistic"
reasons.

Must say there are a lot more of "them" out there then we poets realize.
The readership of formalist folk like Hecht and Wilbur are mostly
non-writers. Also got a Penguin copy of Robert Frost's Early Poems in a
review box that included Alice Notley's wonderful new book. The editor of
selection argues hard how Frost wanted to reach an audience, as oppossed to
those crummy modernists like Pound & Eliot. Can't say I have much feeling
for Frost, but I've known dozens of folks, mostly non-poets, who treasure
him.

I must say I never had touble w/ the poetry audience being composed of
other poets. Are we not a wee bit like Commies of yore trying to get people
to pick up the sullen art? Many of us were non-writer readers briefly, but
the urge to write fixed that. I mean, it ain't like taking up the cello.

I've found the best response to my work coming from non-writin' artists in
other disciplines.

Henry, et al,

I ran "byt i bytie" by the translation staff.  They enjoyed it.

Byt is fairly easy; you're on the mark with everyday, ordinary life.
Both people I asked mentioned first cooking, then laundry... then
asked me what "drabness" meant and said "yes, that's it:
drabness, ordinariness, mundane" or something to that effect.

Does this mean you're a proto-laundrist poet?  (I should send
you my socks... we do our laundry in our teeny-tiny tub and it's not
much fun.) The more romantic overtones implied in your first
mention of byt do not at all figure into the Russian word; getting
onto or thinking about getting onto the street is more appropriate
to ideas of "beat" in the American cultural-literary sense (or to a
whole swath of 1980's hard rock & heavy metal lyrics).

The concept of a "byt" poet could maybe work into Zen sidewalk
sweeping etc., or maybe could be taken into more interesting
directions... what's it mean to define yourself as the poet of drab,
ordinary, everyday, underwear-scrub-in-the-tiny-tub existence?
(There is no valorization of the everyday in the Russian sense of
the word.)

Bytie is more difficult.  "Eternity" doesn't work.  Bytie means "life"
in a philosophical sense, and we tried "sense of life", "nature of
life", and "understanding of life" without success.

One of our dictionaries says: "being, existence, objective reality"
[Yuri says the last only occasionally applies].  Then cites the
fundamental Marxist bit "Social being determines one's
consciousness."  It's also in the name of the first book of the
bible: "kniga bytia", Genesis.

The point of the title, according to translator Yuri, is that Byt and
Bytie are opposites which overlap in sound and meaning and
cannot exist without each other.  In Russian the title is playful,
evocative and beautiful.

All of this may be a bit of an aside, but I enjoyed it.  And if it
makes Erik laugh some more, my job is done.

>byt? What's that? Russian for "boot" ? :-}

I believe it's Russian for "everyday life".  Viktoria Schweitzer has a
biography of Tsvetaeva titled something like "Byt i bytie" or
Everydayness and eternity.  Byt I think actually means something
a
little stronger - drabness, ordinariness, mundane.,..  it's
pronounced
sort of like "beat", appropriately.  I'm a proto-byt poet myself.

Nedge isn't an institution, it's a magazine.  Nor does it seem to be
inert - it's a pile of correspondence and ms. that seethes and boils
with unanswered SASEs and flows around my little nedge work area with
sharp paper edges and paper clips and stuff.  It's my byt & I can
barely cop with it.  I don't get easy approbation from SPD either, or
other inert institutions of the vast and bulbous avant-garde.

Brent, Rilke's craft is just fine.  The dancer (Tracy), on the other hand, has
a problem with her writing craft.  She has none.  None at all.  She dances.
She doesn't write.  So, she reads Rilke for the various aesthetic, spiritual
and other pleasures that his writing offers.  She doesn't read Rilke, as I
have done from time to time, for ideas on how I might write better poetry.
That's all I was trying to say!

The first cite for this word in Webster's 3rd:

[ME, fr. LL _radicalis_, fr. L _radicula_, _radic-_, _radix_ root + _-alis_ -al
-- more at ROOT] 1: of or relating to the root: proceeding directly from the
root . . .

* * *

I've thought a lot about this word, about one of its current meanings as well
as its etymological root(s). What can it possibly mean, today, with respect to
aesthetics, lifestyles & politics . . . ?

Does this word have any contemporary value? Is it genuinely descriptive? Is
poetry radical . . . aesthetically or with respect to "vision" . . . today? I
can only think of a handful of poets, of the last twenty, thirty years, I would
even vaguely consider calling "radical," and I'm not sure I'd even go so far as
to call THEM radical. I don't think, for instance, much of the work under the
microscope in _Radical Artifice_ is genuinely radical . . . I think the writing
of Andrews, Bernstein, Drucker, Hejinian, McCaffery is ultimately very safe,
aesthetically, if not (compared to other things) particularly popular . . . and
certainly the lives (context) out of which this work has arrived has been
equally safe . . . which is not to say I don't enjoy this writing or respect
how anyone lives their life . . . what I know of anyone's, anyway . . . just
that I don't see any of it transgressing or arriving beyond any significant
pre-established boundaries . . .

While I don't think the radical/conservative distinction is utterly without
value, I'm not convinced it's of any significant value with respect to
poetry-making in late 20th century western culture. I don't, in other words,
understand the value of manufacturing camps of poets ("radical" v.
"conservative") . . . if what so-called "radical" poets are doing, essentially,
is largely a form of habitual attendance to aesthetics. (Which has been itself
an habitual MO for at least a century).

Can someone with an investment in the Radical/Conservative Poetics distinction
please elaborate their investment? With specific examples & elaboration? It'd
help me think further about this.

Thanks,

As a kid I was very struck by Kierkegaard's notion of the knight of faith
which, in my no doubt inaccurate version, is the person so spiritually
radical in the lack of taint of ego as to seem completely ordinary.

THE ERRORS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

INSTEAD OF DESTROYING THE OLD STATE THE FRENCH SHOULD HAVE BUILT ON THE
FOUNDATION THEIR ANCESTORS HAD LEFT THEM

       YOU MIGHT, IF YOU PLEASED, have profited of our example and have
given to your recovered freedom a correspondent dignity. Your privileges,
though discontinued, were not lost to memory. Your constitution, it is true,
whilst you
were out of possession, suffered waste and dilapidation; but you possessed
in some parts the walls and in all the foundations of a noble and venerable
castle. You might have repaired those walls; you might have built on those
old foundations. Your constitution was suspended before it was perfected,
but you had the elements of a constitution very nearly as good as could be
wished.


And so goes the opening lines of Edmund Burke's "Reflections" -- the
foundation of modern conservatism. This is the definition, still very
relevant and functional today, that some of those you mention work
from/against in their various strategies -- Andrews, from instance.

Erode and destroy the old oppressive systems that don't want to change
because it would involve questioning, compromising their power base, their
way of life, their order of things.

We still have our own Robespierres running around someplace. We have academic
Robespierres, coorporate Robespierres, government Robespierres, legal

read Edmund Burke or any other conservative writings I wonder?

"As a kid I was very struck by Kierkegaard's notion of the knight of faith
which, in my no doubt inaccurate version, is the person so spiritually radical
in the lack of taint of ego as to seem completely ordinary."

This is a lovely thought, whether yours or Soren's, but I think it can be used,
and no doubt will be used, to apply to anyone. It can also be used
dismissively, like EST's "You say you didn't get it? You got it" or Huey
Lewis's "It's hip to be square." Because the radical/conservative distinction
relies on definition for its authority, I want definition in any defense to
challenges to it. The above isn't, to me, definitive . . . yet. Could you maybe
give me an example of poets who are so radical as to seem completely ordinary,
and contrast this to poets who seem completely ordinary but whose ordinariness
is not causally related to their being radical? More significantly, could you
explain how their radicalness transforms itself into the outward appearance of
ordinariness? What that process is?

"Andrews for instance . . . Erode and destroy the old oppressive systems that
don't want to change because it would involve questioning, compromising their
power base, their way of life, their order of things."

What oppressive system can Andrews's writing be said to erode? His work and
career arrive from the context of capitalism and literary
production/career-making and readings of same are subsumed by the same context
into which they arrived, having made, at best, minor ripples on the surface of
any system, oppressive or otherwise. Some of his books are mass-produced, & if
I'm not mistaken replete with validating blurbs from respectable, authoritative
contemporaries in positions of influence and power relative to the
canonization, reading and/or dissemination of literary product. His readings
generally cost money to attend, and are introduced with validating verbal
montages of awards, publications, career highlights and blurbs garnered
throughout his near-life-long navigation through western literary society. What
success or visibility he has had has been the result of hard work (writing
well) and socially acceptable career attendance. Has his work thrown into
question his own power base, his own way of life, his own order of things?
Andrews has taught at Fordham University for the last 20, 30 years. His name
pops up in _The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics_. His
inclusion in this volume does not seem to erode the thing's power, nor (more
significantly) the system which gave rise to it. If anything, it helps to
support it, lending it a kind of "street cred" among those of us who do
recognize value in Andrews's work. Could you maybe elaborate, explaining
specifically what and how you see Andrews's writing destroying and eroding?

Please note that I'm not questioning value, in general, in Andrews's writing
and career; I'm questioning the ultimate value of reading it through the
radical vs. conservative lens.

Thanks again,

Last post for a while, then I will be quiet.
Just some thoughts on "radical"

A radix or root works paradoxically: by digging deep underground it sends up
flowers and fruit high in the air.

In MERCHANT OF VENICE the character Gratiano is on the surface a brutal,
vulgar, bigoted, obnoxious boor.  But at the root of his name is "grace".
Gratiano is like the bull in the china shop - both consciously &
inadvertently he upsets the careful and hypocritical veneers and
repressions of the main characters; he is a sort of truth-teller.
By naming him Gratiano Shakey is being ironic - epitomizing gracelessness -
but perhaps also characterizing the RADICAL working of grace, as truth
breaking down the constructs of human pride, fear, hypocrisy, self-
delusion (all richly on display in the Merchant himself, Antonio).

Now the political poets out there will be thinking, O God, another
traditionalist Burkean deal about human nature... what does this have to
do with radical politics?

Imagine this: democracy - real commonwealth - HAS to be based on a deep
or radical recognition of human weaknesses. WE DEPEND ON EACH OTHER to
eat, live, love, divest ourselves of our illusions.  How many utopias
and revolutions are based on truly reactionary IDEALS of Superman
the worker God the doer of Great Deeds the mighty Just One etc...
by the same token, radical life/poetry HAS to be based on a deep
recognition of human capabilities.  How many years go by under the
dead weight of complacent and feeble establishments... "A sower went
out to sow.  The seed fell on poor ground...etc....The seed is the word.
Some hear it gladly - but because they have NO ROOT IN THEMSELVES, they
quickly fall away..."  "let the dead bury their own dead..."

 Radical
poetry takes its proud (Luciferean) freedom and plants it humbly back
in the compost of human problems and questions. That's what makes it radical,
and readable.  There is also radically beautiful poetry, so overwhelmed
with itself that its beauty creates a radical relation with the byt world
of mediocrity, the safe, the humdrum.  So free & beautiful as to constitute
a threat not only to the byt world but to byt talk about poetry and this byt
list and yours truly byt

But the real issue is whether somebody does something to be outrageous or
because it is simply the next obvious step to take.  So, for example, the
work of someone like Susan Howe or Mei-Mei Bersengrugge is, in that sense,
extraordinarily ordinary.

Also note, "ordinary" does not mean "platitudinous."

A talk by Megan Schoerke: =B3New Light on Marianne Moore=B2

TONIGHT
=46riday, May 8, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street
=46ree

Megan Schoerke's fresh take on the "arch-modernist" Marianne Moore
(1887-1972) begins with an unusual source, Moore's letters to her family
held at Philadelphia's Rosenbach Library and Museum and now in print. The
correspondence shows to what degree Moore's poetry subverts and parodies
the elitism of High Modernism of the first half of the 20th Century, and
the heavy Presbyterianism in which her close-knit family was imbued.
Schoerke's research into Moore's process reveals her as a textual cousin of
Gertrude Stein, a radical poet whose experiments with "coding" and
encryption allow a doubleness of reception made singularly clear to us for
the first time.

Megan Schoerke is an assistant professor of English at San Francisco State
University. Her essay "Efforts of Affection: Marianne Moore=B9s Elegies for
Her Mother" will be published in the forthcoming Critical Essays on
Marianne Moore, edited by Elizabeth Gregory. We nabbed her in the nick of
time, as she has recently won a year-long writing fellowship at the Tanner
Humanities Center at the University of Utah.

This event is part of "Communicado: Real Poetry for Real People," a talk
series sponsored by the California Council for the Humanities.

My original intention was to historicize the definition of "radical" through
an opposite, and the Burke seemed fitting because it is the foundational
text of conservatism that helped to legitimize the culture and politics that
Bernstein, Andrews et al (and other schools, poets, factions) worked
from/against (rehashed many times here). Perhaps this doesn't make them
radicals in your book. But on a macro level, I think it does. Can we group
people who write and teach with people who've fought tyrants and died for
it? And call them all radicals?
Obviously, we need to stay specific and I appreciate your questioning in
that respect. I owe you a political reading of Andrews, but you might want
to begin with the AERIAL issue devoted to Andrews -- otherwise, the value,
"in general," as you say, is its radicality. Do you agree? If not, what is
the value?

I'm interested, especially in your use of the present progressive
"transgressing" & "arriving" in conjunction with commenting on the "safe"
place "out of which this work has arrived" -- or rather, has arisen?  I
don't mean to do picky proofreading, but it brings me to a question that
i've been wanting to broach to the list anyway!

is "no longer transgressing" a quality of work that has
arrived -- ?
and i'm wondering if this is the difference between a "poetics"
and an "aesthetics" __?

I don't believe there's such a thing as a radical
aesthetics, & i'm wondering if that's in part what you're critiquing,
since most of our examples have been of established writers who "were" (i
would argue) radical & are now "lim(b)inal" or have at least recognizable
"limbs" attached to their works (criticism or stereotyping) which point
back at them, identity their work as ecompassing a certain aesthetic -- ?
(i hope this image, contorted as it is in my brain, translates here)


does a dynamic (or radical) poetic eventually erode or settle into an
aesthetic? Only then, i think, can i justify classifying a series of
questions  &  attempted answers (a poetics?) a or several writer(s)
proposed almost 2 decades ago now (i.e. lang po so-called) as not
"transgressing . . . pre-established boundaries" -- as merely existing as
aethetics, as having ceased to employ its questioning/heuristic function.

I'm confused also by "pre-established boundaries" -- scalapino & hejinian,
for example, did and do "cross boundaries" when it comes to ideologies of
the self in relation to experience --

LH: "All my observations are made from within the matrix of possibly infinite
contingnecies and contextualities. This sense of contingency is ultimately
intrinsic to my experience of the self, as a relationship rather than an
existence" (1988).

This may seem like old hat to a younger generation schooled in
this thought (and hence it appears in our work as an aesthetic), but i
think Hejinian was taking poetry to a different place, by applying this
(albeit not so original) thought to poetry -- she (and others) propose a
radical rethinking of the self, of poetic voice, of experience, etc.

as for its value -- it depends on what you mean by "significant" -- i.e.
to who, to what discourse?

> I don't, in other words,

begs the question again, which i'd like to raise -- what's the difference
between poetics and aesthetics?

or rather the question could be "egoless so as to seem completely
ordinary"? a lot of innovative work is radical at the expense of the ego
(in ideology, in writing -- but not in reality!).  But this is probably
beside the point.

From the "Shorts" section of Thursday's Financial Times


(London)  A report issued yesterday by Europe's leading poetry firms
promises a rise in entry-level and middle management positions.
The report, titled "Versing 2000," predicts a 18 percent growth in
the field before the millennium.
    In the report's introduction, Madallene Drucille of the Belgium-
based Poeticom, says "We are looking for talented and ambitious
young writers with a professional interest in poetry."
    Today's poets need not feel hamstrung by literary history, says
Drucille.  "In fact, too much of a familiarity with old forms
can be a real liability for perspective employees.  We need
writers not afraid to take chances, and we look for that in
writing samples," she later offered in a phone conversation with
the FT.
     But aspiring young Plaths and Eliots should not be without respect, =

she hastened to add.  "What we are not looking for though is people
with ego problems.  Good employees always remember both that
the client's needs come first and that they are part of a major
organization with an international reputation," she cautioned.
    Eike Kahlheit of Bonn's Uberreden concurs in his contribution
to the report.  Kahlheit says Uberreden requires some firm
guiding hands.  "The real need is for supportive but stern
manager-editors, people with experience focusing the energy
of those on the shop floor."  Later he states that "Distraction
is real problem for our new employees.  So much so that we
have taken to restricting Internet access on most of our PCs
to business related sites only."
    Drucille adds, "It's a tough balancing act between nurturing
the creative process and seeing that the work gets done.
Experience in retail management is a major plus."  Poeticom has
today announced that it wil soonl begin a job search for two
mangers to oversee stables of twenty each.
    Share prices on all listed poetry firms are expected to increase
steadily in the wake of the report until the summer slow-down.

  I've certainly found this, too--and my favorite things to look at aren't
poems, but paintings. I always tell my students to pay close attention to the
other arts. There are things to learn in them that may seem too simple, too
bald in one's own art. Maybe it's just a way to refresh the mystery that seems
to diminish slightly as one works in a particular medium for a while.

The next revolution in poetry will be the same, old, singular revolution
probably wearing corderoys & a colored print. The malordorant reality of
the craft tapers with rags and wrinkles not strung up on a silly pole
carried. Such an endeavor entails immense risks and impediments to
prevent understanding from sneaking in, yet to cut short the compulsion
to interpret seems necessarily quixotic.

No one can embrace true poetry till they have explored the cast-out,
false poetries. On this list the obvious ones to absorb are the poet
laureates-- considering the negative banter abounding. Some of the folks
on this list would have us disreguard Robert Hass' Field Guide because
of his laureateship.

Truly dangerous work is not able to be cannonized, it will destroy those
who benefit from the process of subdivided arts. A slate without
segregation will not advance particular identities. Blankness is the
failure of alternatives to come to mind.

As usual myth seeks to solve a dilema. A myth signifies primarily by
what it wishes to exclude. Before we hide a want to be seen fleeing.

Be well

isn't the "ultimate value" not blurring the distinction between the facile
and the authentic acknowledging on the way the pleasures of both, one
poetry, the radical poetry's the poetry you need and the other the cunning
the crafted the terrifyingly tidy maybe the poetry you want and there's
avante garde poets in both i started to say camps but it's not opposition
as is too often imagined in urban US but complimentary. One thing Duncan
taught was when you turn Archie Ammons or Bruce Andrews into the enemy
maybe you waste a little too much of your own energy that might be better
spent performing your superior practice and ignoring them while they play
in the corner either the contrast is there or you can't make it so by
saying so, in a certain way, Duncan's opposition playful or malicious as it
may have been made Blaser a better poet, another way to say it would be
chose an adversary worthy of opposition or you diminish yourself. And
received ideas or unexamined homilies of any stripe, left or right, avant
or derriere, make vomit. You won't get ahead by climbing on the back of
C.K. Williams or Carolyn Forche, rather your prayer be their poems improve
and surpass your own, what a wonderful world that would be, though i don't
share his harsh judgement, i appreciate Silliman's idea of going after the
best, he's not wasting his breath on Vendler.
and whether you want to admit it or not you know some of the radicals who
are plentiful out here:
i think some of us are talking about radical as practice and some others
are talking about the radical as behaviour and/or lifestyle.

I'd say John Wieners is a  radical poet, Duncan McNaughton, i can't believe
Valparaiso isn't on the tip of the tongue of..., but of course i
understand, men who do not tiptoe around the correct are feared and ignored
and called incomprehensible,  if you're teaching contemporary american
poetry and not teaching McNaughton you're not teaching, who's written a
jazz poem like Black Spoon, only Baraka's in the tradition is in this
league, and not teaching Baraka, that would qualify as cowardice, Rodefer,
he's radical,Hannah Weiner, alice notley, Dodie Bellamy, they're fearless,
Maxine Gadd, Gerry Gilbert,Nate Mackey, Gerry Creede, Kevin Davies, Jeff
Derksen, Lisa Robertson, full steam poets, poets who aren't afraid to be
fools, Jennifer Dunbar and Edward Dorn, jeremy prynne, instanter, David and
Eleanora Antinova, Armand Schwerner, lots of radicals out here, Dorothy
Trujillo Lusk, Judy Copithorne, Rhoda Rosenberg, Victor Coleman,i could go
on all night, take off your blinders boys and girls
it's not only apples and oranges and tenures and genders its pomegranites
and kumquats and salmonberries and welfare and saxophones and violins and

Must say there are a lot more of "them" out there then we poets realize.
The readership of formalist folk like Hecht and Wilbur are mostly
non-writers. Also got a Penguin copy of Robert Frost's Early Poems in a
review box that included Alice Notley's wonderful new book. The editor of
selection argues hard how Frost wanted to reach an audience, as oppossed to
those crummy modernists like Pound & Eliot. Can't say I have much feeling
for Frost, but I've known dozens of folks, mostly non-poets, who treasure
him.

I must say I never had touble w/ the poetry audience being composed of
other poets. Are we not a wee bit like Commies of yore trying to get people
to pick up the sullen art? Many of us were non-writer readers briefly, but
the urge to write fixed that. I mean, it ain't like taking up the cello.

I've found the best response to my work coming from non-writin' artists in
other disciplines.

I think Andrews himself would be well aware of the dilemma you
point to... he's quite sussed about it in fact.
In his LINEbreak interview (transcribed in _Chloroform_) he firmly
situates himself "in all the major oppressor groups".  He deals with this=
,
and issues of the political potency of poetry in general, by suggesting
that large-scale mobilizations are typically only good for shoring up
the status quo.  That writing works first on the *writer* and then on
discrete readers already tuned into a particular project (literary
or political).

It seems a method of survival in this sense.  A way of dealing with these
"oppressive systems" without a kind of personal acquiescence.  And better
than prosac there's perhaps something of value in the example.  (Tacit
support or conscientious objection?)

Whether this is "radical" or not is less interesting to me.
But I do think the practice of chomping on the candy-coating/linguistic =

products of the culture industry in order to peak at the structures,
restrictions and the pervasiveness of its ooey-gooey center is, in your
words, something that should be "valorized".

Perhaps this is just my way of agreeing with you Gary while explaining
an attachment to Andrews (from whom I've learned much much).
"Radical"... past it's sell-by date maybe... and with "revolutionary"
long dead, and "avant-garde" grounded, are we without a metaphor
to call our own?
"Tactical"?
Howbout "Survivalist"... wear fatigues, move to Montana, carry guns that
shoot fridge-magnets...  I'm sure Morphy would be with me!

From Henry:
"Imagine this: democracy - real commonwealth - HAS to be based on a deep
or radical recognition of human weaknesses."

Two, I think, resonant quotes in light of Henry's request (imagine
this...):

Melville's Ishmael:  "Heaven have mercy on us all - Presbyterians and
Pagans alike - for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head,
and sadly need mending."

and Robert Creeley:

"The imagination of a commonwealth must make that sharing literal - there
cannot be an invested partiality hidden from the participants...Realize

Any time you say what someone else said _in your own words_
you are saying something else. But verbatim, who among is
is is T. S. Eliot? or Ezra Pound? or their greatgodson
Ted Berrigan? still there must be a way to talk about what
other people talk about without seeming angry or unintelligent.

Jonathan's mapdrawing is nothing new and therefore no more
attractive to laughter than anyone say Bob Grumman's or Miekal

   laugh more though.
Maps and censuses need remaking constantly but they don't,
you just need to have allies (friends) everywhere you go.

Now this message must turn to the cello. There will be two reading/
recitals in June by me and cellist Louise Dubin, whose poems have appeared
in the Poetry Project Newsletter among other places. The first
reading is the weekend of June 7 at International House at
Columbia, the second is June 18, 6 pm or so at Teachers & Writers.

Poetry Project's Ymposium in full steam. Tim Atkins, Julie Patton,
Mark Nowak, Brenda Coultas have all given readings you would have
found admirable. T/K: Tim Davis, Ange Mlinko, Rod Smith, Gary Lenhart,

The obsolete (worn-out, effete) is the key to the future. The effete is
the most powerful thing in the world because it asserts its own absolute
value flying in the face of all byt practicality - the whole trade of life.
Check out the film version of the Russian novel "Oblomov" for a good example.
I go back to "radical" and the action of roots.  Mark Prejsnar started all
this off saying innovative poetry tears apart, breaks up.  This is true,
but not in the way of critical analysis (which breaks up & also keeps the
analyst/observer at a distance).  Poetry, via imitation & pathos, divides
and binds together the opposites - grace and disgrace, in a way that
the observer experiences & participates in.  Poetry is both precious and
radical.  It's preciousness - i.e. the beauty of language in itself, the
music of language - is like the flower, the radical beauty which challenges
the byt world.  It's radicalness is its absorption of present reality
and reflection of its pressures and details in depth.  It digs down like
a root to the hidden disgrace underlying a society's surface smoothness,
the chaos under the ordure, Yeats' "beauty sets its throne in the place of
excrement" or however it goes.  So when you fuse radical beauty (the music)
with radical insight, you have a very powerful sword in your hand, says
Blake.  So Aristotle makes tragic poetry (drama) the exemplary form of
poetry in general - the mediating power revealing the human weaknesses
that divide and bind a community together/apart.  And going back to
M. Magee's Creeley quote can suggest how these forces are still at work
and put to use by poets radical enough to take up the challenge.

"He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends,
heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew.  Hath not a Jew eyes?
hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same
diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer, as a Christian is?  If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you
tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong
us, shall we not revenge?"  - Shylock, from MERCHANT OF VENICE

I mean Gary S. asks about radical poets, rather than poets who are
radically egoless and so seem like ordinary people rather than poets
-- which is what the quote suggested to me.  A pertinent point, I
think, as the whole thread has fallen to the side of careerism
rather than poetics, if one were to make that a distinction.

 I don't understand what phrases like "taint of ego" or "radically egoless"
actually mean.  in the jobs post, it means someone who isn't a team player  --
both of these suggest to me that the absence of ego is a desirable end, which
seems to me to be impossible, except for psychotics who are psychotic all the
time.  can you explain to me what you mean by "egoless"?

Henry--answering you before I read the other 265 messages I find
now that I've returned from somersaulting waterfalls . .

In what has been called "abstract" or "non-syntactic" poetry, I don't
think the model of the sublime as you describe it (which I read admittedly
quite rapidly) can be applied, as there is not a logical "first"
meaning which is superseded or filled to bursting with intimations
of a grander not paraphrasable meaning. But your point is very well taken,
and I now seem to recall that Lyotard, it might have been, and perhaps
others too, were much influenced in their ideas about writing by
a preference for the sublime. Mike McColl

Charles--having paraphrasable content = sense (in a conventionals sense)

The meaning of "sense" can be broadened--makes a weird kind of sense,
etc--but I think it helps to keep that meaning restricted and
use "meaning" for a broader sense of sense. At least that's how I
was thinking of it. And it also helps to make comparisons to abstract
painting. When someone said a painting by Kandinsky was better than
some other abstract painting, wouldn't a defense of this judgment
involve new and different criteria than a judgment concerning
two representational paintings?

well, for onr, the means of production for writing poetry are generally at
hand --pen/pencil, paper, stamps, the local xerox shop. Also poetry has a
tradition of self-instruction (i'm sure there are good writers out there
who have never set foot in a writing workshop).

Other disciplines take a bigger leap of faith. There is the case of the
graet Brit saxophonist Andy Sheppard who, at age 19, bought a used
saxophone, played it non-stop for a week and played a street corner concert
soon after that (and the rest being history), but that is a rare bit of
d.i.y.

Poetry offers more avenues for the novice artist in the culture of the open
reading. You just get up, read your stuff, and, usually, poeple applaud.
Ypu sqwauk at an after hours jazz session and you get laughed off the stage
(it happened to a young charlie parker) and, anyways, cellos are expensive.
someone will always lend you a pencil.

Music might be a better analogue for understanding these things.  & I
don't mean music in the Mallarmean-symbolist sense of a purification or
refining away of the "world of representation".  There is a more radical
concept out there of music itself as a representation or expression of
the essential "song-quality" of nature and creation - a sublime notion
in itself.  It's not that essential poetry is not paraphraseable; it's
that poetry is the closest paraphrase of the universe.

Petersburg at night, with the beat of his footsteps providing a natural
measure or meter (as it did for walkers Dante and Beethoven...During
composition/creation he actually sang his poems, as he did while "reading",
that is, reciting them without notes...As part of this orality, he (and
his wife) knew the entire oeuvre by heart: once he lost his portfolio and a
volume of Bergson en route home from Berlin, but no matter: the former could
be bought, the latter retranscribed.  Mandelshtam's process of poetic
creation despite its erudite world culturalism was in many musically
critical ways closer to Eskimo virtuoso Orpingalik... than to most of his
Russian contemporaries.  It was also closer to the Archaic Greek model
that he espoused..."  - Paul Friedrich, MUSIC IN RUSSIAN POETRY

Isn't the "paraphrasable content" (that phrase keeps appearing on this
list) of most poems something like "Please love me for my brilliant, witty
poems" or "Please feel sorry for my pain and suffering."  Or
perhaps I speak only for my own poems.

To have no ego makes no sense at all in psychological terms--Joe is
perfectly correct to point this out. I don't think phrases like "the taint
of ego"  are meant in so literal a way, though. It's like when people say
"cerebral" with a negative connotation; they aren't really imagining
cognition that doesn't take place in the cerebellum--rather they refer to
(what they perceive to be) overintellectualism. [personally the use of the
word cerebral in this context bugs the hell out of me]

Making an end-run around the ego means avoiding a certain kind of vanity,
overinvestment in one's self-concept, etc... This can be very difficult
for some poets. Imagine Robert Lowell trying to do this! Jed Rasula I
think it was who pointed out how many books on American poetry have the
word "self" in their titles... Who coined that phrase about the
"egotistical sublime"?

For some who use the word "ego" in this sense the reference is Buddist,
not psychoanalytical in the least. Perhaps someone can enlighten me on
this score...

Robert Hass is an interesting example. What I've read of him feels like
he's holding back, not quite following through, not going far enough.

Too bad.  He coulda been a contender.

Well sure.  Lack of self-absorption.  The transparent self.

Eigner's work is a really good example of this.  I have heard that in life
he was just as cranky and hard to deal with as most of us.  But in his work
he's just plain invisible.

Emily Dickinson is another example.  In life she certainly seems to have
set out some very well-defined parameters, but even thougth first person
pronouns & possessives appear a lot in her poetry (unlike in Eigner's,
where they almost never appear) there is a marked absence of personal
particularities.

As for absence of ego being a desirable end, see almost any  religion.
Psychotics have different issues to deal with.  But anyway I was talking
about a poet's work, not persona.

Bored?  Then try doing something "creative"
With rhymes Byronically methodical.
What's the opposite of "conservative"?
Uh huh, yes you guessed it right--"radical,"
Though you could've answered "innovative"
And been just as correct.  It's what I call,
So cleverly, a "foregone confusion,"
To which, of course, there's never conclusion.

There are two types of poetry. Only two types.

The one type is purely fictive.

The other type is as true as possible to personal experience.

Of course there are meldings of the two that make it hard to discern
authenicity from fictive content. That is sometimes the poet's own struggle
to remain authentic, and not fall into the labyrinthine traps of language.
Too complicated a metaphor, for instance, with two many misleading nuances,
that no longer says what was truly meant can inadvertently lead there. The
trouble with what used to be referred to as "flowery language".

Of course, there are also those that claim all poetry ought to be fictive.

The latter is most true in totalitarian and totalistic political systems.

In some systems that is the equivalent of "make a joyful noise to the________"
That joyful noise then being what is fictive.

Substitute any authority figure that has enough power to oppress, so as to
cause fear enough to squelch or silence expression, for the  ______.

Boss.

Lord.

Dictator.

Tyrant.

Gary Sullivan's questions in his two posts yesterday about what it
means to write "radical" poetry were very interesting.

I like Bruce Andrews's work quite a bit and have found some of it
surprising in a provocative sort of way. His writing is full of angry
and crazy energy and that's admirable. But I agree with Gary that his
poetry is not ultimately radical  _as poetic act_, for its
"radicalness" is merely textual and not _conceptually subversive_ of
(in Gary's phrase) the 'context into which such radicalness arrives.'
With no apparent remorse, such poetry enters into and validates--
precisely through its self-proclaimed "oppositionality"-- the very
relations of literary production and exchange it purports to
critique. This is not a contradiction that only haunts Andrews's
work.

(Remember all those essays declaring war on the "I" and the "self"?)

This is largely why language poetry grew exhausted and failed and why
smart younger poets influenced by them are obsessively writing about
their identity crisis. I suppose that sounds like a presumptuous
pronouncement, but it's quite simply true. As with all my other
posts, I have no doubt that once everyone sits down to think about it
that there will be a happy consensus around the point.

A few days ago my neighbor set up an electric dog fence in his yard,
and as I watched his poor, bewildered animal leap and yelp and pace
and growl, it occurred to me that invisible dog fences might be
analogous to any "radical" author's legal name.  Eventually,
the dog lay down and slept. Today (ah, beautiful spring, blossoms
abounding), he barks and bares his teeth, and everyone is safe.

Kent- fascinating post--
Who would you consider a smart young language influenced poet writing
about identity? What do you mean by identity? Some language poetry seems
to be about identity too or at least the "problem" of identity?

thanks, judy, for making the distinction, esp. since i wasn't trying
to make a point re: egolessness except to point out how i saw gary
reading & discussing the particular quote

i'm with judy -- i read it in the sense of not having a "big ego" -- of
being able to engage in poetry not for oneself (selfishly) or one's
career, but for poetry -- though a notable (and possibly volatile)
exception would be Pound, who (at one point or another, but
not ultimately?) made accomplishments in all three
(selfishness, careerism, poetry)

(call me an idealist but) i believe in poetry for poetry's sake -- & i
believe _that_ sort of engagement is a very generous act --
not selfish, or self-contained or escapist, as the term (art for
art's sake) is often critically applied

yikes i can't believe i said 'art for arts sake' -- a term which i'm
not ready to defend (it's someone else's understanding, not mine)

i really just want to know what the/some difference(s) between
poetics & aesthetics is/are. -- any ideas? anyone?

Linda Russo asks, quite reasonably:

>What's the difference between poetics and aesthetics?

I don't know what the difference -really- is, but I think I understand the
difference in the way these terms are used.  Poetics is at least in part
generative; in so far as they're explicit, one's poetics help guide what one
wants to do in one's work.  They may also be polemical (I write like this,
so should you) or simply offered as an option (here's one way to write).
Aesthetics, insofar as it's still connected to a traditional philosophical
discipline, assigns value to already extant work via application of
antecedent principles.  It's little concerned with identifying fruitful
methodological possibilities (though I suppose one's aesthetics might
valorize work that can point the way to other work, that opens rather than
closes doors.)  Surely the border between these two notions is porous.

So: what's the difference between aesthetics and literary criticism?

I was never quite sure what all this "problem" of identity stuff was about
either, not quite buying the whole "social construction of the self" thing.
But someone on this list once quoted Creeley as saying that a certain poet
(does anyone remember who he was talking about?) dealt with "the crisis of
self", and then I read Julian Jaynes and things started to fall into place.

Yes, to talk of "obsessively writing about their identity crisis" does
sound a little dismissive. To me, the notion of "selfhood", as problematic
as it is, is central to the human experience. That vital, fearful schism of
self from not-self is something that most of us hold dear, while yearning
to break down the barriers. Selfhood is a castle and a prison.

Writing that appears not to be from a unified self, as interesting as it
often is, can be read as even more ego-centric than writing peppered with
"I"s, "You"s and other personal pronouns. At least the latter is qualifying
the utterances as being specific to the speaking persona (the writer's or
otherwise - these are "my" thoughts, feelings, perceptions), whereas the
former may be seen as claiming some sort of universality.

These are not meant to be attacks, just observations after trying to write
a poem without any personal pronouns. It turned out to be more "personal"
(is this different from "self"-centred?) than any of the "I" poems that I'd
written. But at the same time, the utterances "from the blue" seemed almost
presumptuous.

Well, the sarcastic answer is that literary criticism is a way to
disguise a political and philisophical agenda (Derida would be a prime
example) as aesthetics.  The literature enters in because it's so easy to
take writers out of context to put your words in their mouths.  Like I
said, the sarcastic answer <grin>.

***  I'd hate to see the welcome wagon:
     Imagine you're about to move into your half-million-dollar dream home in
a plush Denver suburb that you know as Cherry Hills Village.  Then, you see
that the sales contract includes the full name of the development, and it
isn't Cherry Hills.  You then ask the real estate agent to tear up the
contract.
     That's what happened when Bill Weinberger was set to buy a $497,000 house
-- in Swastika Acres 2.  "I told them not only no, but hell no," voiced
Weinberger, a Denver businessman who is Jewish.  The agent tried to explain
that the property records date back to a corporation called the Denver
Swastika Land Co., founded in 1908, well before before the Nazi Party was
founded and adopted the swastika as their logo.  Weinberger felt that if the
residents hadn't yet petitioned to change the name, they must be anti-Semitic.
     Saul Rosenthal, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League office in
Denver, noted that complaints about Swastika Acres seem to hit his desk every
few years.  But because this coincidence isn't an example of intentional
bigotry, he doesn't see it as a "substantial issue facing our community."  An
ancient symbol of the Chinese, Asian Indians, Greeks, and Scandinavians, the
swastika has been found on coins, pottery, and other artifacts, and even in
the catacombs of early Christians.  Some Native American tribes also viewed
the swastika design as a symbol of infinity.
     Nonetheless, Weinberger is looking elsewhere.

Thanks everyone for the diverse and well-considered responses. You've given me
much to consider.

I do want to address Judy Roitman's post, and say that, I agree, though their
writing appears prior to the time-frame I was thinking of, Creeley, Eigner and
Niedecker all share, especially Eigner and Niedecker, an appreciation of
subsistence that is made palpably manifest in their work. That's as radical, or
maybe more significantly, as generative, a critique of capitalism as there is.
As Maria Damon knows, I ultimately consider the life, ideas & work of Amy
Dacyczyn more generative than those of Chomsky or Nader. (Which is not to say I
don't find either Chomsky or Nader of great value, too.)

Judy also mentioned Susan Howe and Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, who are more or less
of the time period I was thinking of. With Susan Howe, I don't find that same
appreciation of subsistence in her writing; I find what I'd call the
manifestation of academic middle class anxiety. By "academic" I mean not
situated due present. By "middle class" I mean a preoccupation with property,
equity, possession, representation. By "anxiety" I mean surface agitation
causally related to unslaked desire. There's also something of the tour-guide
about her presentation of work. Her project, for me, its value notwithstanding,
strikes me as a pure product of capitalism. I can appreciate it & maybe even
use it, but only with that caveat.

Linda Russo really addressed what I was questioning: Is it possible, in the
context of the immediate present, to be a "radical poet"? I mean, everyone
addressed it, I guess, but I think Linda articulated it in a way that for me
felt most accurate. It's not a question that I feel can be answered at the
moment, but I keep coming back to it.

I like Duncan McNaughton's work. I love John Wieners's. Also Victor Coleman's.
I think the latter's is undervalued in this country.

Did anyone mention Jeff Conant? I know of very, very few American poets I
wouldn't be embarrassed to call "fearless." He's one of them.

I don't see any poet or school as "the enemy," so, as to "obvious poets to
absorb" from among the "cast-out, false poetries" -- I like this idea. I also
like Heraclitus's, that nature loves to hide. So, rather than Hass, I'm going
to spend some time looking into the life & work d.a. levy. Anyone with tips (I
already know about the Ghost Pony Press collection), please send along.

Henry Gould, as always, your responses are brilliant, & make me smile. Which is
not to say that I necessarily agree with you, but that I appreciate what you
say, how you say.

Thanks again, everyone,

Peace,

But I wasn't talking about how anyone is in life (selfless, careerist,
etc.) but whether their _poems_ were "about" self or not.  That's all.  One
could presumably be totally careerist and a real shit-head, but write
absolutely luminous and transparent poetry.

What? Sure, if you want to see a diminished sense of self-importance in
that work, I can agree. But not invisibility. It is Eigner who made that
work, and there's certainly nothing like it. Maybe what we're talking about
is more a question of 'how' the self is inscribed rather than 'whether' it
is inscribed. And I think this is true of Dickinson, too.

What I meant by "identity crisis" is the broader relationship between
a group of younger, "innovative" writers and the older Language
poets. The tensions in that relationship seem to provoke a sense of
anxiety for some of the writers in the younger group, to the point of
its having become the object of some strong critical reflection
by people like Mark Wallace, Steve Evans, and others. (Though there
is clearly a good deal of anxiety among the old-guard as well about
the fate of their once triumphalist project.)

The anxiety and identity crisis stems, as I see it, from the fact
that a project that was once nourished by a strong sense of radical,
political commitment has spawned, as closest offspring, a
fundamentally aestheticist and career-driven poetic community that
bears little trace of the father's youthful oppositionality. (The
father, now tenured and comfortable, hopes his child will one day
become more serious.)

In my previous post I alluded to the author function as being the
drive-shaft that makes such institutionalization and commodification
quite natural and inevitable. An old argument, to be sure, but one
that few want to consider, I think, because of its broader
implications.

Has anyone seen the movie "Hype"? It is about the grunge scene in
Seattle and is probably the best cinematic illustration of Peter
Burger's _Theory of the Avant-Garde_ that there has ever been.

I can't, literally, afford the Aerial Andrews issue, though I'll try to get it
through interlibrary loan. For me, the value of Andrews's writing is not its
radicality. What I find generative (as well as pleasurable) is the intensity,
or rigour, of its focus. His consistent attendance to, and exploration of,
that.

Small Press Traffic presents

Dodie Bellamy
Robert Gluck

Friday, May 15, 7:30 p.m.
New College Theater
777 Valencia Street, San Francisco
$5

Dodie Bellamy is celebrating the publication of her new "novel," The
Letters of Mina Harker (Hard Press, 1998), which Joan Retallack has
described as an "epistolary novel, a bestiaire d'amour, a
hyper-para-transgeneric, complex realist exploded vampire cartoon of very
touching hi-lo life-death saturated intelligence, sex, humor, philosophy,
history, literature, mass culture." Dodie Bellamy is also the author of
Feminine Hijinx (Hanuman, 1990) and Real: The Letters of Mina Harker and
Sam D'Allesandro (Talisman House, 1995), as well as three chapbooks. She is
the director of Small Press Traffic Literary Arts Center.

Robert Gluck is the author of several books of poetry, including Reader; a
book of stories, Elements of a Coffee Service; and two celebrated novels,
Jack the Modernist and Margery Kempe. When one tries to describe Gluck's
lapidary, sexy, smart hyperfictions, one finds oneself overcome by a
strange Tourette's Syndrome of superlatives. "Brilliant--squawk!
Superb--squawk! A beloved teacher and friend--awk! Top ten postmodern
writer--squawk!" Longtime board member of Small Press Traffic, Gluck was
one of its founders way back in the mid seventies, and the former director
of the Poetry Center at San Francisco State.

Guessing that this means anthologies and that one that might fit the bill
is Allnut, D'Aguiar, Edwards, Mottram, eds., _The New British Poetry_
(Paladin, 1988).  Not altogether satisfying but worth a look, if you can
find it.

*** Court rules against use of Elvis name

In a decision that limits the parody defense in trademark
infringement cases, an appeals court has ruled against a Texas
restaurant that was being sued for calling itself "The Velvet Elvis."
The decision by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a
lower court ruling which had held that "Velvet Elvis" did not
infringe trademarks held by the Presley estate. The case was brought
by Elvis Presley Enterprises, which owns all trademarks and publicity
rights belonging to the Presley estate. It sought to prevent a
Houston bar, which featured velvet paintings of Elvis, a frozen drink
called "Love Me Blenders" and a hot dog named "Your Football Hound
Dog," from calling itself "The Velvet Elvis." See

*** NBC, Attenborough plan Bible miniseries

In what could be the most expensive miniseries ever launched for
broadcast TV, NBC is planning a 12-hour epic called "The Bible," with
Richard Attenborough executive producing. Details of the project are
in the discussion stage, but Attenborough will be heavily involved in
the creative aspects and is expected to star in and direct some of
the two-hour installments. "The Bible" will feature stories of the
Old Testament and will culminate with the birth of Jesus Christ. The
estimated budget could go as high as $150 million, which is more than
double the cost of any previous TV miniseries. See

*** Thai snake man emerges from week-long stunt

A Thai farmer completed a potentially deadly stunt on Monday after a
week locked up with scores of deadly snakes in a Bangkok shopping
centre. Boonreung Buachan, 27, from north eastern Si Saket province
had spent the previous 168 hours confined in a small glass-walled
room with 100 cobras and 10 venomous centipedes. Boonreung, who was
not paid for his efforts, spent much of his captivity playing with
the creatures, calmly watching television from a bed as the snakes
writhed among the sheets, or urging curious shoppers to join him. See

  Well, the first sentence of this paragraph made me happy. But hey, wait a
minute there in the second sentence: "I" and "you" can function as loci in the
poem, points of consciousness that connect the nouns and verbs (oh, okay--and
tha adjectives). But why, when we realize that nouns can be more than nouns and
verbs more than verbs and syntax more than syntax (alright, I'm reaching), but
WHY must pronouns always be personalized?

And yes, the elision of pronouns in the interest of universality has always
struck me as the height of egocentrism.

But really, what's up with this pronoun problem?

What's a "personal particularity"?  I hope it's not a quirk, or a
peculiarity, or even the sort of peccadillo that makes the work of David
Bromige or Rodney Dangerfield more interesting (to me anyway) than the
limpid productions of any number of spiritual athletes.

I hope it's not what enables Ron Padgett to write lines like

        Seriously I have this mental (smuh!) illness

                                        which causes me to do things

This will probably cause me to be pelted by many ego-free tomatoes, but
in the small unscientific sample which is my life the drumbeat for
"egolessness" or its postmodern equivalents is usually accompanied by
dizzying levels of arrogance, narcissism, and a sort of missionary
humorlessness.  Thanks, but I'll always take the perfectly modulated
dysfunction of a Richard Pryor or a Frank O'Hara or a Madeline Kahn
over any sort of sanitized enlightenment.

and i see myself as a vehicle. am aware i wont be a pure flute, that the

at the same time, 'i' (& yes lower-case) is about the only pronoun i use,

"With the appointment of Robert McNamara as secretary of defense in
1961, the "managerial" approach to warfare soon permeated the entire
military apparatus. In essence, this approach constituted an idea of
highly controlled, "manageable" warfare that could be rationally
administered for highly specified ends. Three basic steps were involved
in this economic rationalization process. First, warfare is approached
as a problem of organizing quantities. Transforming the world into
discrete quantities is therefore a necessary first step in all reasoning
about warfare...."
"Having first transformed the elements of warfare into quantities, the
managerial approach secondly constructs various models for the
production of warfare. Using the model of the individual business firm
in a capitalist economy, the defense managers tried to find "profit
maximization" in warfare...."
"A third step was necessary to complete the managerial approach: the
foreign Other was conceptualized to act according to the same logic of
"profit" maximization. The intellectual operation here is called "game
theory" and the idea is to simulate a conflict given certain parameters
concerning what is a "rational" response by the opposition...."
"By adopting microeconomics, game theory, systems analysis, and other
managerial techniques, the Kennedy administration advanced "limited
warfare" to greater specificity, making it seem more controllable,
manageable, and therefore desirable as foreign policy."

family; a child under 15 was worth $14.40. The United States government

I'll share something that happened (to me) that ties in with whether
anyone can be radical, let alone a radical poet.  I don't fly very often
and recently I had to take a round-trip flight with a stop at the airport
in Minneapolis.  The entire airport is no-smoking, including the curbside
areas (except one area at the extreme end of the airport I stumbled upon
on my return trip).  Of course, people were lined up smoking in front of
the no-smoking signs.  The people in suits stood on the other side of the
curb looking over at us while they waited for rides/taxis/whatever.

It struck me that the most subversive act available for most people today
is smoking in front of a no-smoking sign.  Or, because of rising prices,
taxes, group pressure, just smoking.  It's very reminiscent of Chomsky's
writing on the media: so much 'radical' behavior (e.g. smoking) has been
put on display in parody or put on display and then discounted that the
boundary lines have become in some case unlocatable and in other cases so
narrow that being radical, subversive, whatever is a daunting task to say
the least.  If there are no revolutions in the streets, no movements that
show any signs of changing the world and the paradigm, how can poetry be
radical except against itself again and again.  Or radical/observational
in the sense of following the shift paradigm of the status quo and
capitalism (and yes I know differentiating the two is problematic).

Ode to Ron Padgett

[from an imaginary textbood]

Permission is granted, but not do do anything you want.
--John Cage

"...  which brings us to the category which I will term the 'permission
granter,' whose style seems as effortless as it is easily imitated. Anyone
could do this, we think, brilliance is within our reach.  These permission
granters, poets of genius themselves, never intimidate their
readers--unlike the 'pure geniuses' discussed in Chapter 4.  Putting aside
false modesty, I can myself aspire to be a permission granter, as could
any reader of this book.

Yet there exists another sort of permission granter whose influence is
entirely nefarious.  Offering nothing to the ear, the eye, or the mind, he
is admired precisely because he gives solace to equally wretched poets,
'nice people who unfortunately write poetry.'  This judgment will seem
unduly harsh, yet .... "

Kent Johnson is to be admired for his creative and provocative involvement
in some of the more dynamic poetry projects of the last few years.

But, his last couple of posts are wrong in many ways.

*While it fits with his own intricate attack on the institutionally
constructed subject/agent of the poetry world, his emphasis on "careerism"
etc. doesn't really work as a critique of various recent tendencies
outside the mainstream.

*Lack of insertion into the career/power/celebrity nexus is precisely what
characterizes many in the poetry world.  (Indeed, it is part of the
sociohistorical givens of the situation of poetry in general, even (though
in a far more muted way) that of the academically-situated workshop
world.)

*I believe there are things to be gained by radically destabilizing the
poetic subject...It's fun, for one thing.  (The primary, humanly
liberating criterion for evaluating art-activities.)  But a slide into
careerism is certainly not the primary problem of various contemporary
poets whose work is widely read by Listees...Nor for that matter have they
"failed," Kent.

*The overall context is problematic, and a continual pain to live with.
But that is just what, from Spicer on through more recent writers, has
fueled good poetry projects.

*To quote Jerome McGann.  "In these textual moves Spicer, as it were,
mortalizes the poetic event, and his manipulations of the physical book
are the emblems of a similar humane insurgency typical of the (later) work
of contemporary experimental writers.  The bookishness of postmodern
writing is a form of ironic self-representation.  It situates poet and
poem firmly in the social, institutional and even the economic heart of
things.  As a consequence, much of contemporary poetry becomes--in no
pejorative sense--a dismal science, the poetry of dies mali, an
imagination of writing that knows it inhabits a world ruled by Mammon."

(The Black Riders, p.108)

*The claim here that such strategies situate poetry "firmly in the heart"
of things, is an understandable exaggeration.  It's precisely that such
maneuvers leave poetry still marginalized, that gives the entire
enterprise its twist and its demented contours....

*Anyway, thanx to Kent for as usual bringing up important issues.

Art-product with ego carefully scraped off its face is not wholly possible. The
art-product is particular, an instance. The instance itself can be examined as
an instance chosen over potential instances.

Dizzying levels of arrogance, narcissism and a sort of missionary humorousness
(as opposed to humorlessness) might describe both Pryor's and O'Hara's bodies
of work. I have great respect for both, but can't take either in large doses
without feeling suffocated. There is something wanting in the range of emotion
or outlook in O'Hara's writing: "In Memory of My Feelings" is such a lovely
entry into what, in poem after poem I'm disappointed to find to be mostly one
or two feelings, as though he's perfectly modulated everything but exuberance,
ironic gesture and the occasional maudlin moment out of the picture. To the
extent O'Hara's writing proposes a mimesis of human emotional experience (& I
don't mean to suggest this to be its real, or only, proposal), I find it to be
ultimately very sanitized.

Gary?

Can we talk for a second? I know it's been raining for eight months solid
here in New York, but which edition of O'Hara have you been reading? I
mean I know you _like_ to collapse the complexities you see around you
into possibilities for humorous response -- and have you seen The Onion? I
think they took your Ask Mrs. Ted Hughes idea, man! Sic em. Anyway I'm
wondering if you'd like to borrow, or photocopy from my copy of O'Hara's
collected, because it has a few other "feelings" in it, such as hatred,
compassion, regret (really!), bemused distrust, self-loathing,
self-regard, etc etc. I guess you could think of O'Hara's aoristic
standards as somehow always only exuberant, but that would be kind of like
thinking the Greeks were always only talking about killing their parents.

I have & have read O'Hara's _Collected Poems_, his _Love Poems_, _Lunch Poems_,
_Second Avenue_, _Meditations in an Emergency_, _Early Writings_, _Selected
Plays_, and one other that Grey Fox published, the title of which escapes me at

The Mrs. Ted Hughes gag wasn't mine (tho I posted it) nor did the format for

Subject:      poetics of subsistence
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

At the risk of being tedious, I am writing a much longer post than I usually
do, so consider yourself forewarned.

Gary Sullivan's tantalizing and challenging remarks about a poetics of
subsistence are intriguing to me, and I am  elaborating on them in my own
way and without any real idea of his understanding of this phrase.  Hopefully
the following is not entirely irrelevant.  I take "subsistence" here to
mean a drastically scaled down middle-class lifestyle resulting from a social
organization trying to escape and even dismantle the programmed consumption
of time and space, labor and things.  Since I know very little about
subsistence living as a social movement in the U.S., I am speculating here,
and probably rather naively too.  I imagine subsistence living is sustained
by both new and recovered notions of self-reliance and communitarianism,
which in turn are informed by a range of variously plausible or viable
economic and ecological theories and practices.  I do not know how
class fits into this scheme of things.  All of this would seem to require
a thorough reconsideration of how and why we spend time and energy in work
and leisure, including in the production and consumption of poetry.

The idea of a poetics of subsistence is also intriguing to me because the
poetics of wastefulness seems to be more pervasive, or at least more completely
theorized.  I think it makes sense to talk about them both together in this
context.Bataille of course and many others have posited the importance of
excessive expenditure to the means of artistic production.  The polemical
impetus for such a conception of art, earlier in the century anyway, seems
to have been to try to remove the creative act from the economies of
Freudian drives or of commodity exchange, and into the domain of play,
which for the most part is aesthetic (if your idea of play is based on
Schiller and Nietzsche).  This claim then is at least minimally related
to the perennially vexed issues of the use-value and autonomy of the poem,
especially whenever "free" play becomes the occasion for some kind of
critique.  PErhaps the poetry of Bruce Andrews is one of excessive expenditure,
at least its propulsive wantonness suggests so to me.

I suppose it's obvious that both of these poetics rely on ideas about energy.
How and why does a poem capture and expend energy from the networks of
social and natural relationships in its vicinity?  I say poem and not
poet in order to leave open the application of this question not just to
writing but also to reading.  A poetics of subsistence might be derived from
hypotheses and knowledge about energy, which I think is an important word
but one perhaps with a confusingly large  number of meanings.  At any rate,
it seems to me not enough for this poetics to re-present the imagery and
diction of a way of life.

With respect to poetry (admittedly a specialization belied by my idea of this
poetics), some hypotheses and knowledge might result from thinking about
formal issues in a way that I associate first with Pound, and then with
Olson and Zukofsky.  Beginning with form, however, would not preclude talking
about the energy of material production and distribution; maybe even the latter
should come first, though I myself know little about it.

Should a poetics of subsistence have a vocabulary of technical words such
as "energy" and "ecology"?  Yes, but what good (and what fun?) could come
from writing poems out of a self-imposed and thus extrinsically motivated
need to define such terms?  Would such a poetics be inherently didactic
(georgic)?

If a poetics of subsistence is defined by poets like Creeley, Niedecker,
Eigner, and also Snyder and Whalen, then is its primarily a minimalist
poetics of the postmodern lyric?  Is a poem with this orientation for the
most part going to be a short one or at least use short lines?

Would a poetics of subsistence, to the extent that it is practically and
politically interested in the movement of energy, need to encompass a
bewildering diverse array of poets, such as LAwrence, Jeffers, Ammons,
Cage, Enslin, Kerouac, Merwin, Swenson among many others?  (Being ignorant
of such poetry in other languages, I mention only those writing in English.)

How would those poetics dedicated to deconstructing grammaticality abet or
confound a poetics of subsistence?

I stress "energy" rather than other abstractions such as power, language,
hegemony because it helps me think about what I am doing by
spending a hour typing this up, and some portion of time each day plugged
into the power grid/controlled conflagration that is my home or office.
How expensive is this process of playing and working with poetics?  ARe these
questions futile because the structural position of their enunciation is
urban and middle-class and spatially nul?

Shew! enough for now.

Gary R.

I don't know, Gary, you slammed me pretty hard last week for my post where I
suggested radical elements in B. Andrews' and other work. Considering the
nature of my post and my own love of politics, I had no problem with your
line of questioning. I wouldn't even call it "ferocious," but considering
the gist of your counter-opinion -- that the value of his work lies in it's
"focus" "energy" and "intensity" -- perhaps you should turn the bullshit
detector on yourself.

Sniping aside, you're on the right track in questioning generalizations.

gary r. and interested others:  i feel obliged here to self-promote by
noting that my essay on whitman and *energy* specifically---"no wasted
words:  whitman's original energy"---is forthcoming in vol. 12 of
_nineteenth century studies_ (should be) next month... the laser-proofs are
on their way to me even as i post this... i've been toying with this idea
of energy for twelve years now, ever since listening to don byrd read
"this compost" in a grad seminar... and feel that i'm only now able to
articulate it without confusing the hell out of whitman's poetry/poetic AND
(19th century) science (couldn't have managed any clarity at all w/o tenney
nathanson's groundbreaking work on whitman's "voice")... be interested in
what anyone around t/here has to say about the piece... i'm hoping my
modest effort will serve as a sort of springboard for further, no doubt
much better informed inquiry...

best,

I don't feel I slammed you, Robert. I did question what was said in your post.
Jordan questioned what I said in my post, but I felt the tone of it was mean.
Meaning it felt like it was meant to hurt as much as to examine the limitations
of what I said. Jordan tells me backchannel that he was merely being playful,
and so I'll respect that, and should apologize for misreading it. I apologize,
Jordan. Seriously. Jordan also tells me he was hurt by my insinuating he's
mediocre. "Mediocrity loves company" was actually directed at myself, not
Jordan. Meaning I've been talking a lot, lately, & relishing the company, but
also having that "gawd, shuddup awready" feeling. Anyway, I think Jordan's
critique of what I said, to the extent it stuck to what I said, was more than
fair, and I'm glad he disagrees. I'd personally really like to see instances in
O'Hara's grander scope of emotion posted here.

I agree the bullshit detector should be trained on me as much as anyone. I'm
the wrong person to do that, though. I'd welcome, from you, or anyone, any
critique of my reading of Andrews. I don't post because I'm in love with my
thoughts; I post already knowing what I think, the limitations of that, &
hoping to get other perspectives. I hope I put enough "I think" or "It seems to
me" kinds of qualifiers in there so that's understood.

Anyway . . . I'm relishing reading Gary Roberts now on "subsistence" . . . an
admittedly vague term that Rachel was thoughtful enough to backchannel me about
& question.

PS: My e-mail spellchecker wants to change "backchannel" to "bacchanal."

I do too,

   Emotional Range.....
   Should it be a value?
   I often say "yes"
   but sometimes say "no"....
   Sometimes "sanitized" is good is necessary.....
   ----
   The more interesting question for me right now
   is the relation of reader to writer when it comes to
   "emotional range"-----
   I know I keep harping (unduly) on that Auden blurb
   in which he says he can read Marianne Moore in ANY MOOD....
   and that I am skeptical of that (and I don't mean this as a
   criticism of Moore)....
   I guess when looking at myself reading other poets (or writers)
   I wonder what effect (or affect) my "emotional range" has

   And, if one is a SUBJECTIVIST, how making claims about a
   poet's emotional range will always be too some extent a claim

   Yet, despite the seeming noncommittal quality of what I've just said,
   I realize there IS a valid perspective from which O'Hara can be said

Dear Randolph,

I'm enjoying the books you sent me so much.  They're beautiful!!!!  I
mean stunning.

I'm not done with either yet but so far in Arbor Vitae I love the puzzle
aspect--the chaos that is not, the unspoken (unwritten) word/sign that
dangles in front, the subtle undermining of language use without the
usual knock on the hand "THIS IS A POEM THAT WANTS YOU TO QUESTION YOUR
USE OF LANGUAGE" rather I am thinking about things when I read, the
school, the deaf, iconography, pictures, history.

Your World War II poem a great anti-war poem.

I continue to enjoy the work.

Also--

My friends Jennifer Heath (Irish/Australian/American) and Steven Taylor
and Judy Hussy and Eamon their child are heading toward Dublin on
Thursday.  Jennifer lives with poet Jack Collom and is a fiction writer,
Steve is a musician (with Ed Sanders punk band "The Fugs") and writer,
Judy is a dancer/writer and Eamon is learning to walk.  I don't have a
map in front of me to see where Bray is.  They will also be in West
Galway.  They rented something.

I told Jennifer I'd mention her to you.  Her email is:
                                103326.2404@compuserve.com

If you'd be interested in meeting them and have a chance to email her
today or tomorrow.

until later,
Rachel

The relative lack of "emotional range" in O'Hara's work is, it seems to me,
quite political in that the tendency of his poems  to private or coded
exchange of meanings must be viewed as  reacting against the social pressures
that pathologized homosexuality during this period (& is played out quite
subtlely, for instance, in the first plate of the _Stones_ collabration in
which Rivers immediately destabilizes the title of the piece ("US") by
decorating the letters to resemble an American flag -- the pun being that the
two meanings to which the title now alludes were opposite, homosexuality being
equivalent at this time to un-Americanness).  Of course an aesthetic of
silence (would this be in some way related to an aesthetic of subsistence?) is
even more apparent in the work of, say, Johns, Cage, or the Ashbery of _The
Tennis Court Oath_,  for whom the avoidance of artistic expression (and the
refusal, in consequence, of a "determinate focal point or center of interest"
[Branden Joseph]) shifts the work's emphasis, as Chris Stroffolino seems to
suggest, away from its autographic or gestural content to a priviledging of
the viewer's (or reader's) receptivity -- that is away from a transcendental
to a social meaningfullness.  Susan Sontag's important essay "The Aesthetics
of Silence," roughly contemporary with the emerging avant-garde of O'Hara's
generation, is quite revealing re these issues.

Wait a minute--
Are we taking for granted O'Hara's lack of emotional range, then?  I've
never found this to be the case.  It is true that he usually has his
defenses up (except when he lets them done); that he is chatty and
facetious (except when he's not) etc... In other words, he is extremely
difficult to generalize about, because I can find you the poem that shoots
the generalization to hell. He has more styles than just about anyone in a
shorter period of time. There is the style (and emotional range) of "The
Clouds go Soft" for example, or his poems about Gregory Corso.  This is
not to deny the point about a certain reticence in his work, like
Asbhery's "Our days put on such reticence / these accents seem their own
defense."  Yet this "aesthetics of silence" is not a constant either. What
about "Biotherm"?

I am not arguing that having such an emotional range is a sine qua non. I
don't care that Creeley has a fairly limited range, for example. I am just
puzzled by the acceptance of this judgment about O'Hara....

Australia, South Africa, the Caribbean, Israel, India, Singapore and all
the other nations, large and small, where poetries are written in
English, will be welcome.  The Deadline is December 1, 1998.  Please

 Sulfur #44 had previously been announced (in Sulfur 42, just out) as a
Pacific Rim issue.  But we have decided that, given our own knowledge
(or lack thereof) this might be too problematic.  So we've chosen this
route instead.

    With best wishes,

Maria,

about the best recent anthology of experimental british
work (though not sure how multicultural) that I know of is
Iain Sinclair's "Conducters of Chaos" published a couple of
years ago (there's a review of it somewhere on the EPC).

Good representation of differing strands of radical british
work from the last twenty years or so. I would point
especially to the selections by Aaron Williamson,

best,
Sean

Hi, Robert:

I want to request two things. The first is that, rather than simply dismiss
"focus" "energy" and "intensity" as values worth my time & interest attending
myself to, you explain why they're "bullshit." I'm willing to consider what you
have to say.

Secondly, since it's obvious now that the Andrews issue of AERIAL doesn't yet
exist, I'm going to make the assumption that you haven't read it. Which means .
. . well, that you offered me something "of value" that you have no personal
experience with yourself. In other words, you have opinions about things you've
never read. I don't want to make this assumption; I'd much rather assume you've
read the magazine's contents in a galley copy or manuscript. Please let me
know. In either instance, I'd still like to see that reading of Andrews's
writing as of significant political impact. YOUR reading. Not his. Nor his
pals.

Thanks,

Gary

Ok, but your equating words like "intimacy" "engagement" and "me" with the
ego, whereas Creeley would be hestitant to do so, since selfhood for
Creeley is so fragamented.  Here's a quote from his collected essays:

"I am struck by the situation of schizophrenia wherein the experience of
body may so place the hands or feet or anus in the consciousness so
affected, that no comunal agreement as to their location is possible.  A
self-created reality in that way dominates and isolates the one who has
become, even without intention or agreement, its world."

This is the self as a "complex of occassions" to use Olson's phrase,
nothing like the bourgeois or transcendental ego.  Creeley, I think, would
agree with William James, that "The ego is simply nothing: as ineffectual
and windy an abortion as Philosophy can show."

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I think part of the quietness surrounding Gary Sullivan's charge that
O'Hara emotional range is "very sanitized" is a sort of bafflement
(clearly expressed by Jordan's asking Gary whether they both have the same
edition of the Collected Poems).  I don't think this quietness means a
tacit agreement with this assessment.  I can't think of any poet whose
work, and whose expression of human emotion and its variety and range, is
LESS "sanitized," (though I'm not sure what that means) so it is hard to
know how to respond to Gary S.'s comment.

As Jonathan Mayhew points out, O'Hara's work is _defined_ by
self-contradiction,  by shifting styles and modes;  any generalization
about his work is easily contradicted by various other specific examples.
From what I can tell from reading O'Hara, he would LOVE this (and
Jonathan's post in general about his variability).

In what seems to be a response to someone criticizing his emotional
range, O'Hara answers (in the poem that has been
making me happy on the New York subways for the last few months):

"I'm not going to cry all the time
nor shall I laugh all the time,
I don't prefer one 'strain' to another...
And if some afficionado of my mess says 'That's
not like Frank!', all to the good!  I
don't wear brown and grey suits all the time,
do I?  No. I wear workshirts to the opera,
often.  I want my feet to be bare,
I want my face to be shaven, and my heart --
you can't plan on the heart, but
the better part of it, my poetry, is open."  (My Heart)

Of course there is some bragging in these last lines, but I think he's
right about his own work; while Gary's point that O'Hara frequently
modulates between exuberance, ironic gesture, and maudlin moments (I'd say
melancholy, maybe) is a good observation, it misses so much of O'Hara's
variety, nuance, and range.  (Never mind the fact that a poet who handles
exuberance, irony, and sadness so deftly would be a great writer even with
just those three modes).

To see O'Hara's poems as exhibiting what Gary calls narcissism and
arrogance is to only see half of what they are up to.  This self-regard is
always problematized, undercut, ironized, theatricalized, and seen as
flickering fiction, a naked host to one's many selves. ("Now I am quietly
waiting for/ the catastrophe of my personality/ to seem beautiful again,/
and interesting, and modern.")  He's painfully aware of how "sentiment is
always intruding on form" ("To Hell With It.")

You can open to any page in the Collected and see so many more than the
"one or two feelings" Gary names.

POEM

Instant coffee with slightly sour cream
in it, and a phone call to the beyond
which doesn't seem to be coming any nearer.
"Ah daddy, I wanna stay drunk many days"
on the poetry of a new friend
my life held precariously in the seeing
hands of others, their and my impossibilities.
Is this love, now that the first love
has finally died, where there no impossibilities?

TO JOHN ASHBERY

I can't believe there's not
another world where we will sit
and read new poems to each other
high on a mountain in the wind.
You can be Tu Fu, I'll be Po Chu-i
and the Monkey Lady'll be in the moon,
smiling at our ill-fitting heads
as we watch snow settle on a twig.
Or shall we be really gone?  this
is not the grass I saw in my youth!
and if the moon, when it rises
tonight, is empty -- a bad sign,
meaning "You go, like the blossoms."



                I shall forget forever America
which was like a memory of an island massacre
in the black robes of my youthful fear of shadows.
So easily conquered by the black torrent of this knife.  (from "Hatred")


I find it hard to see how these and countless other poems are
"ultimately very sanitized" and limited in their emotional range to a
handful of notes.

Curious to know what others think.

take care,

Andrew Epstein

Thanks, Michael Magee for that Creeley excerpt. I'd love to read the entire
essay, but don't have the collected essays. Do you know, is it in either A
Quick Graph or Was That a Real Poem . . .? What's the title of the essay? Lemme
know. & thanks again.

Jonathan! in re your suggestion:

Here are some poems I think
demonstrate some of his emotional as well as stylistic range:

"Who'd of thought / that snow falls"
"Mr. O'Hara's Sunday Morning Service" [in _Poems Retrieved_]
[The Clouds Go Soft]
"Poetry"
"A True Account of Talking to the Sun"
"Answer to Vozneshensky and Evtushenko"

I've taken the liberty of typing those poems out, in part because it helps me
to SLOW DOWN as I read the work, but moreso because I'd like the pieces up
here, on the board, because I'd really appreciate a reading from you of these,
specifically concentrated on the emotional range, which isn't as obvious to me
as the stylistic range. I'm still seeing grey, & feel like a chump, a chimp, a
cheap simp, a peachy mispeep, etc. As Chris Stroffolino and Jordan Davis and
you all I think intimated, it's more likely a limitation of MY emotional range.
Could you (or anyone) take these poems apart . . . help foreground their
emotional resonance for me? I know taking poems apart is icky-critic work, but
this is O'Hara . . . & I think the poems will still sing, will be as lovely as
they were before we got our dirty paws & thoughts all over them. (Just got
Andrew Epstein's post . . . thank you! especially for quoting!) . . . --Gary


WIND

   to Morton Feldman

Who'd have thought
                             that snow falls
it always circled whirling
like a thought
                    in the glass ball
around me and my bear

Then it seemed beautiful
                                    containment
snow whirled
                   nothing ever fell
nor my little bear
                         bad thoughts
imprisoned in crystal

beauty has replaced itself with evil

And the snow whirls only
                                     in fatal winds
briefly
                                     then falls

it always loathed containment
                                            beasts
I love evil


MR. O'HARA'S SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE

There is this to be said
for Sunday morning: that if
I have been very bad the night
before and wake up feeling

like a drab on a sunny day,
Dick will pop into my room
and invite me out to the
high abandoned airfield.

There, the sun will seem
properly chilly and the wind
will not compromise us
with any silly sentiment

I will walk about on the
heaving grass rather shakily
and observe the model airplanes
lofted by dry blue currents.

As Dick like a discus hurler
throws his wood into the sky
I begin to feel engaged and
follow the glider straining

its little spirit into swoops
that clumsily break and bounce
to earth with a grunt. Then
he must pick up on its wings

and go home, to make repairs,
to putty its nose and straighten
its tail, to talk about winds
and temperatures and balance,

to think about theories of
flight, and shave perhaps. So
all through dinner our clear
anxious eyes remain aloft.

POETRY

The only way to be quiet
is to be quick, so I scare
you clumsily, or surprise
you with a stab. A praying
mantis knows time more
intimately than I and is
more casual. Crickets use
time for accompaniment to
innocent fidgeting. A zebra
races counterclockwise.
All this I desire. To
deepen you by my quickness
and delight as if you
were logical and proven,
but still be quiet as if
I were used to you; as if
you would never leave me
and were the inexorable
product of my own time.


A TRUE ACCOUNT OF TALKING
TO THE SUN AT FIRE ISLAND

The Sun woke me this morning loud
and clear, saying "Hey! I've been
trying to wake you up for fifteen
minutes. Don't be so rude, you are
only the second poet I've ever chosen
to speak to personally
                                 so why
aren't you more attentive? If I could
burn you through the window I would
to wake you up. I can't hang around
here all day."
                     "Sorry, Sun, I stayed
up late last night talking to Hal."

"When I woke up Mayakovsky he was
a lot more prompt" the Sun said
petulantly. "Most people are up
already waiting to see if I'm going
to put in an appearance."
                                      I tried
to apologize "I missed you yesterday."
"That's better," he said. "I didn't
know you'd come out." "You may be
wondering why I've come so close?"
"Yes" I said beginning to feel hot
wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me
anyway.
             "Frankly I wanted to tell you
I like your poetry. I see a lot
on my rounds and you're okay. You may
not be the greatest thing on earth, but
you're different. Now, I've heard some
say you're crazy, they being excessively
calm themselves to my mind, and other
crazy poets think that you're a boring
reactionary. not me.
                              Just keep on
like I do and pay no attention. You'll
find that people always will complain
about the atmosphere, either too hot
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.
                               If you don't appear
at all one day they think you're lazy
or dead. Just keep right on. I like it.

And don't worry about your lineage
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on
the jungle, you know, on the tundra
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting
for you to get to work.

                              And now that you
are making your own days, so to speak,
even if no one reads you but me
you won't be depressed. Not
everyone can look up, even at me. It
hurts their eyes."
                         "Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!"

"Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's
easier for me to speak to you out
here. I don't have to slide down
between buildings to get your ear.
I know you love Manhattan, but
you ought to look up more often.
                                                 And
always embrace things, people earth
sky stars, as I do, freely and with
the appropriate sense of space. That
is your inclination, known in the heavens
and you should follow it to hell, if
necessary, which I doubt.
                                      Maybe we'll
speak again in Africa, of which I too
am specially fond. Go back to sleep now
Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem
in that brain of yours as my farewell."

"Sun, don't go!" I was awake
at last. "No, go I must, they're calling
me."
        "Who are they?"
                                 Rising he said "Some
day you'll know. They're calling to you
too." Darkly he rose, and then I slept.

Based on the quality of past AERIAL issues, I am definitely making an
assumption that the Andrews issue will be worth reading.

As I stated previously, I owe you a reading of Andrews, and I will try to
deliver on that when I get a chance. There are a number of things on my
plate right now, including a review of Millennium Vol.2 -- a big task that
may produce some more detailed insights on the issues we've raised.

The Creeley essay I quoted is from 1973, entitled "The Creative."  I
*highly* recommend, to everyone, buying the Collected Essays - the essays
are as brilliant as the poems.  -m.

Gary (and who ever else is interested):

I don't usually want to do lit-crit explications on this list--that's what
I do in my books and articles on Spanish poetry. Here's my brief take on
some of the poems I suggested, however:

"Mr. O'Hara's Sunday morning service"

The experience of transcendence in friendship. The title of course a
take-off on T.S. Eliot. An alternate model of spirituality.

"The Clouds go soft"

"Am I the same person I always was? What is my identity?  I still wear the
same shirt size as at age 16"

"Poetry"

"My casualness is all a mask, as you can plainly see; if I write too
slowly and worry about being a great poet I will scare my muse away"

"Who'd have thought..."

My favorite O'Hara poem. Is it better to live in a self-contained world,
identified with childhood?  No, actions have consequences, snow falls. I
must face the evil within myself and even love it.

"A true account"

"I must give myself permission to be a great poet (which I am) by
imitating a great poem by Maiakovsky."

"Answer to ..."
beautiful invective:
"These Russian communist poets accuse us Americans of being racist, which
pisses the hell out of me. American culture IS black culture, and
vice-versa. Not only that, but the Russians are not even worthy heirs of
Maiakovsky, as I am (see "A true account")."

I get a different emotional "charge" from each of these poems. I apologize
for the crudeness of these paraphrases. Maybe Gary could suggest a poet
he thinks has a great emotional range--the contrast might clarify his
reaction to O'Hara...

Great "emotional" range:
an interesting  concept all by tiself: that somehow the language and the
poetry would choose one or/over the other.
The discussion of O'Hara" "you don't refuse to breathe do you" (Is It

Frank is Number 1! Go Frank!

"In Memory of My Feelings" is a good place to look to see the full range
of emotion O'Hara's poems can handle. It asks the eternal question who
am I? and rather than answer with a barrage of sentiment, very coolly
and wittily maps out the terrain of identity. Emotions in the poem are
expressed indirectly, as if he were trying see the "Medusa" without
being turned to stone. Thus in turning slightly away from the direct
address/redress of emotion, he is able to map an entire range of
emotions by mapping the movements of the mind through (variously)
surreal imagery, personal narrative, classical art and history, national
history, mythology and pop culture. All sashay and swagger about in a
drag carnival as possible locations/masks for identity. The result is a
movement through terror to ecstasy to resignation to satisfaction to
pain to pleasure, no single emotion outdoing the other as they all vie
with that most-modern of dillemmas, identity.  The problem as it is
revealed in the poem is that the poet discovers not a single unified
self, but a series of masks which hint at something other than
themsleves (I would argue something resembling the Kantian sublime), but
never reveal it because whatever it is is not to be seen directly (like
the Medusa).  By revealing to himself the drag of identity, the poet is
able to handle both the question who am I? more deftly than most poets I
have seen, but to express a range of emotions hitherto unavailable in a
poetry which does assume a stable ego.

See also "Second Avenue", "Ode to Michael Goldberg..." and "Easter" for
this type of complexity and emotional range.

Truly,

Mike

stable identity, unstable... one self, many selves... isn't it all the
same narcissism?  Not just in O'Hara - it sort of defines the difference
between lyric & epic, lyric & narrative.  The "unstable" self misses
out on the history in which the stable self is tested & ground
down or raised up. While humorless grandiosity or puritanism as
Rachel said doesn't make very good poetry - nevertheless, in a
narcissistic Seinfeld industrial-commercial culture that can't
even look at its own cities or the 3rd world, much less improve
conditions there, maybe there's something in this radical/
narcissism/sustenance question...something political... - Henry G

Henry,

I don't know if I'm arguing or agreeing with you, but wouldn't you say
that in the context of 1950's America, a time in which the US goverment
along with all of US commercail and media industries took a hand in
attempts to forcibly "identify" persons within very strict categories,
ie, american/un-american, the former being defined as straight,
right-thinking, christian (Robert Lowell) and the latter defined as
queer, pinko, atheist (Ginsberg) that the destabilizing of identity
would in itself be a political act, one with potentially "real"
political consequences (Lillian Hellman)?

No contradiction.

There seem to be several definitions of "self" and "ego" & etc. (e.g., what
does it mean to "rid the ego from writing?") running around here.

No doubt about it.  But I think that maybe at the present time Gary's
idea of "sanitized" has to do with the "reification" of identity-as-poet
- as opposed to a backgrounding of the poet and a bringing forward of
the "theme" (radical/sustenance).  Lyric vs. epic or something.

Both directions - lyric/epic, personal/impersonal - can be
taken to the limit by radical people.

A nice moment in Charles North's book of essays when he complains about
Ashbery's punishing caprices, like "Leading liot act to foriage", it makes
me think about O'Hara's use of the word "frankly" which always makes me
tip me head forward in discomfort, eyes narrowed as from huge glare.
Nevertheless, I see Uncle Henry steering the holodeck's hull into a butte
and COMPUTER PAUSE would come to my lips if only I knew what any of those
things meant. Bill what happened to Djarmok at Tenagra? I am outing you
but you did it yourself. Now Henry I want to know why you are suggesting
there is a direct connection between O'Hara and Seinfeld. What is up with
those Providence anchorpeople's hair? I don't think O'Hara would have
disliked Seinfeld, but more than that, I don't think any of us who argue
that O'Hara had a better-populated mood palette than Gary argued would
argue that it's possible to write like O'Hara -- not only does none of us
have the datebook of an O'Hara, not only are we more restricted in our
permissions (don't ask don't ask!), we have a somewhat different culture
to pick and choose from. No offense to Zhdanov or Parschikov or
Dragomoschenko, but where in the world are the Pasternaks for a young poet
to cable support? Why haven't the young poets from Harvard shown up yet?
Are they all writing for The Simpsons?

Subsistence, well we haven't heard much about it yet, but won't its
poetic equivalent risk malnourishment? There's been some rumbling (Mark
P? Gary?) about poetry and surplus. I'm no economist, but although poetry
doesn't create surplus value, couldn't it be said to be the surplus of
language itself? and when we say of something that it has duende or energy
or overdeterminacy couldn't it just be this surplus of meaning? Please
don't prematurely count me against the whole earth poetries, but tell me
more, especially if you can do it without using the word "minimal".

OK today --

Gary (and List),


Correct me if I am wrong here, but it seems that what Creeley is discussing in that interview is the sense of "self" which is (hopefully) brought to ALL poems by ALL writers, and not necessarily his ego.


Perhaps I am incorrect, but that's the way I read it.

So much to respond to & even more questions to ask . . . & already on my fifth
post. I want to quote more from Creeley interviews as regards self and ego . .
. which I believe I did flatten into each other . . . because, in Creeley's
case, reading this interview (with Linda Wagner) this morning . . . he refers
constantly to Pound's "quality of the emotion" as his own primary measure, and
elaborates a bit . . . my sense being that emotions are, if not wholly,
certainly in some portion, ego-generated or -situated . . . I may pull some
quotes in a few days . . .

& I'll dig around for things from others to compare with some of the O'Hara
poems posted . . . people whose writings I do consider "less sanitized" . . .
maybe Friday . . . & at that time also say more about this three-word-phrase,
"appreciation of subsistence," which has, somehow, become perceived almost as
movement unto itself . . . I meant it, when stated, with reference to
Niedecker, Eigner . . . & to less extent Creeley . . . it does have a certain
political weight for me . . . above & beyond the political weight that ALL
public writing or language can be said to have . . . but haven't thought of (in
any way shape or form) such a thing as "whole earth poetry" . . . though I know
Jordan's chiding . . . but, will say more later, except to note that neither
Niedecker's nor Eigner's work is thin, undernourished . . . malnourishment a
risk in poetry only ever when you write only what you already know . . .

Letter to his family, Tadjoura, French colony of Obock, December 3, 1885:

"They have left the place its local sultan and the native administration.
The place is a protectorate. The local business is trading in slaves......
The stuff we import is rifles (old percussion rifles that were scrapped
forty years ago) that cost 7 or 8 francs apiece at secondhand arms dealers
in Liege or France. You can sell them to the King of Shoa, Menelik II, for
around forty francs apiece. But there are enormous expenses involved,
without mentionning the dangers of the caravan route round trip. The people
who live
along the route are Dankalis, Bedouin Shepherds, fanatical Moslems: they are
dangerous. It is true we have firearms and the Bedouins only have spears:
but every caravan is attacked."

"In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be
first."---Frederick Winslow Taylor, Scientific Management

"The nickname Prisoner's Dilemma, attributed to A. W. Tucker, derives
from the original anecdote used to illustrate the game. Two prisoners
held incommunicado, are charged with the same crime. They can be
convicted only if either confesses. Designate by -1 the payoff
associated with conviction on the basis of confessions by both prisoners
and by +1 the payoff associated with acquittal. Further, if only one
confesses, he is set free for having turned state's evidence and is
given a reward to boot. Call his payoff under these circumstances +2.
The prisoner who has held out is convicted on the strength of the
other's testimony and is given a more severe sentence than if he had
also confessed. Call this payoff -2. The game so defined is identical
with that presented by Matrix 3 where D represents "confess" and C "do
not confess." It is in the interest of each to confess whatever the
other does. But it is their collective interest to hold out.---Anatol
Rapoport & Albert M. Chammah, Prisoner's Dilemma

"Journalist Mark Baker interviewed one soldier who described what
happened to three Vietnamese detainees in a chopper with an American
intelligence officer:
'The first gook wouldn't talk. Intelligence gives you a signal, thumb
toward the door, and you push the guy out. The other two gooks look to
see this guy going out the helicopter door.
If the second guy didn't look like he wants to say something or he's
lying, the intelligence officer says, "This guy out the door." You'd
kick him out because you're supposed to do what these intelligence
officers tell you to do. They're speaking for the Army. The last
prisoner is crying and he's leaking like a typewriter. He's talking
Vietnamese like crazy. That's human nature. This guy is running his
mouth. You'd have to gag him to make him shut up....
Before we get back to base camp, after this guy do (sic) all the talking
and the intelligence officer document (sic) everything, they kick him
out the door anyway. Even the good gook, they'd give the word on him and
throw him out the door.'"---James William Gibson, The Perfect
War:TechnoWar in Vietnam

"As has beeen pointed out game theory was conceived by mathematicians,
and since the publication of the fundamental treatise, has been
developed almost exclusively by mathematicians. The theory can be viewed
as a self-contained branch of mathematics-a system of theoroems built up
from a set of postulates. All purely mathematical thoeries are of this
sort and, as such, are practically immune from criticism."---Anatol
Rapaport, Fights, Games and Debates---cp

Lilian Hellman writes: would not "the destabilizing of identity," in the
culture of the 50s-60s "in itself be a political act, one with potentially
"real" political consequences?"

The relationship of poetry to politics is of course deeply problematic: is it
prefigurative? instrumental? etc.

In the context of the 60s, as Andrew Ross has pointed out, artists &
intellectuals were confronted with the necessity for making, consciously, a
choice between tendentious social commentary & formally transformative
aesthetic strategies that would undermine autonomous authorial agency (i.e.
collage, montage, etc.).

I think it's important to remember that, at the time, expressionistic work,
with its emphasis on the universal character of the individual's subjective
consciousness would have had, as its underlying assumption -- the assumption
for instance of the Abstract Expressionists -- that this "universal"
consciousness was white, straight, & male.  For this reason, although they
were conflicted in their relationship to Ab Ex, an expressionistic poetics
would have seemed untenable to the New York School poets.

Given, also, the recent & on-going re-discovery of the chief aesthetic
strategies of the historical avant-garde, an expressionistic & autonomous
poetics would have appeared reactionary.  What needs to be done I think is to
work out the ways in which the simultanaeity of the rediscoveries and
repetitions of Dadaist oppositional strategies in the work of Burroughs,
Ashbery, Cage, and to a lesser extent, O'Hara "substantiates the hypothesis
that the discursive formation of modernism generated its own historical and
evoloutionary dynamic" (Bucholoh) -- rather than being for example a pathetic
& failed repetition of those strategies (i.e. Peter Burger).  Moreover, any
discussion of expression in O'H's work has to be historicized, right?  After
all, an attachment to transcendent logics seems to be what O'H was, in part,
attempting to discredit.

Do not have the time to describe Dan Bouchard's & Keston Sutherland's reading

powerfully ironic intelligence & that Keston's work struck me as being a
unique conflation of disjunction  & lyricism, its moments of transparency

For all of FOH's attatchment to Pollock, de Kooning, isn't his work more
analogous to later pals like Rauschenberg (of the combines), Johns, &
Rivers (in, say, "Mr. Art," or "Washington Crossing the Delaware" - all

Michael Magee asks if there is not more connection between Rauschenberg or
Johns and O'Hara than between De Kooning or Pollock and O'Hara. Time does
not permit me now to say why I don't think so, except that Johns is so
affiliated with Ashbery in my mind as to preclude comparison with other
poets, and Rauschenberg despite the monumental output never once seems
even half as intelligent as O'Hara. O'Hara could have to do with the
stupid energy (and brilliant line) of Pollock and the brilliant line (and
stupid figuration) of De Kooning, if stupid only had its post-1987
meanings. Maybe see O'Hara as not on a one-to-one correspondence with
painters, the way Larry Rivers borrows equal parts Koch and O'Hara?

"After all, an attachment to transcendent logics seems to be what O'H was,

This may be true but O'Hara does in some poems incorporate the remnants
of a kind of transcendent logic with more than pastiche in mind, to my
mind; I hear even a little nostalgia for it.  A great poem like
"Kruschev is coming on the right day" seems to be contrasting its
revelling in surface with the supposed weightiness of religious diction
such as "grace."  I suppose it's heretical to think of F O'H as a latter
day Pop version of Hopkins, but sometimes, NOT always, I read him so.
"Rhapsody" and "For the Chinese New Year (and For Bill Berkson)"
would be other poems that I find interesting to read along side Hopkins'
"Heraclitean Fire" poem.  I guess that "discredit" means not "ignore"
but to give a provisional credit/credence to such logic and then to
take it back??

From today's NY Times:

By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL

A Poetic Homage -- of the 3-Letter, 3-Word Variety

<Picture: P>oe Try Art. Web Voy Age. Mie Kal And.

It's Not All. --that easy to tell a tale in trios of three-letter clusters,
exactly nine characters to a page. (The apostrophe near the start of this
sentence, for example, is cheating.)


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------


But And Has. After Emmett, a multimedia poem launched on the Web last month
by the artist and writer Miekal And, takes readers on a 53-screen journey
that is as visually stimulating as it is linguistically limber.

Each page of And's poem [his first name is pronounced "me-KELL," his second
like the conjunction] consists of a three-by-three grid of letters and
punctuation marks. Some grids parse perfectly ("Eye Sea Eye"), others do not
("Hum Ble Ark").

Using a simple animation technique that does not require special browser
plug-ins, And has enlivened each character by continuously cycling it
through a sequence of five to eight different typefaces.

As an "I" arises in typographic fonts such as Bodoni, Harlequin, Helvetica,
Stonecutter and Thunderbird, the vivid vowel seems to swell and shrink. Its
eight neighbors are equally hyperactive, twitching, throbbing and
percolating to pupil-popping effect.

During a telephone interview last week from his home in southwestern
Wisconsin, And said, "All the words are meant to refer abstractly to the
sense of a voyage, and I wanted it [the poem] to be real visual so that the
voyage was hypnotic."

"Even though it's just three words on the screen," he continued, "I want
people to stare at one page for 5 minutes. Even if they get the words right
away, they'll keep looking at the dance of the typography."

"After Emmett" is clever, playful and -- given its formal strictures --
surprisingly effective at conveying an impression of narrative progress. It
joins a growing canon of verse that exploits the Web's multimedia
capabilities to expand the form's possibilities, just as the "concrete
poetry" movement of the 1960's aspired to increase meaning through the
graphic arrangement of words on the printed page.

Kenneth Goldsmith is the Manhattan-based editor of UbuWeb, the best site for
visual poetry on the Internet. He described "After Emmett" as a typical
example of concrete poetry that has been published on the Web, adopting the
dynamics of the medium for its own purposes.

"Concrete Poetry has always tried to invoke movement on the page," Goldsmith
said. "It achieved this through a variety of static means: the flipbook, the
dispersion of letters on a page, etc. While 'After Emmett' employs the
movement of letters, it still invokes the flatness of the page. It's a
journey, but it's a two-dimensional journey instead of three."

He called for even more advanced applications of multimedia effects to
verbal artistry, citing as an example the three-dimensional Visual Thesaurus
discussed in a recent "arts@large" column.

"Now that we are able to manipulate words [on a Web page], the simple formal
manipulation of letters is not enough," Goldsmith said. "Content needs to
sweep our minds in some magical way, supported by today's technology. With
concrete poetry on the Web, the medium might not be the message."

And's work is intended as a new-media tribute to Emmett Williams, one of the
first concrete poets and a leading member of the Fluxus conceptual art
movement (its adherents included Yoko Ono and the electronic-art pioneer Nam
June Paik).

The poem pays homage to Williams's own "The Voy Age," a 1975 piece composed
of 100 word squares. that diminish in size as the work proceeds. By the
final page, the grid is so small that it appears to be a period.

Goldsmith noted that "The Voy Age" and "After Emmett" share thematic
material as well as a graphic structure.

"Williams composed his work in Nova Scotia, looking out on ships moving
slowly across the harbor; And sprinkles water-based references throughout
his work," Goldsmith explained. "The last section of And's work is an
analysis of the formal properties of language -- puns, shenanigans, logic --
which mirrors William's visual-poetic concerns."

And acknowledged that he has been deeply influenced by Williams. Although he
has not viewed "The Voy Age" for a dozen years, And did remember to
construct his last grid entirely out of punctuation marks. (He also cheats a
bit, using the browser frame to title sections.)

"One of the things that attracts me to Emmett's work is how he isn't a
specialist," And said. "He worked in whatever medium came to him."

Williams, now 73, can even be found dabbling on the Internet. His 1957 work,
Four- Directional Song of Doubt for Five Voices, has been adapted for the
Web.

And's creative endeavors, which are detailed on his home page, Qazingulaza,
range from compiling an online dictionary of neologisms to building new
musical instruments like the "ukelimba."

An occasional performance artist, he also was one of the first to reproduce
artists' books on a photocopier; the imprint of his publishing firm,
Xexoxial Editions, is derived from the name of a certain copier
manufacturer.

Born 40 years ago in central Wisconsin as Michael Anderson, And now lives
about 70 miles from Madison. Around the bean-sized town of West Lima, And
and a handful of like-minded residents have founded an alternative community
dubbed Dreamtime Village. Their goal is to balance a devotion to the soil
with a high-tech approach to creativity, an unusual mix that resembles And's
aesthetic.



"I find that a good place to begin is to confuse the boundaries as much as
possible," And said. "A very fruitful area to work in is wherever all the
genres and medias and boundaries meet. A lot of my art is based on working
those edges to the max."

O'Hara's essay on Pollock, though, often reads like a guide to O'Hara's own
work.  Esp. the parts on the sense of the kinetic in Pollock, the way
Pollock can seem to speed up or slow down movement through the canvas by
thinning or thickening the line.  Put that together w Kenner on Pound
"relaxing or tightening the texture of the vocabulary" (or something like
that--re Propertius) and walla you pretty much get FOH.

meanwhile chalk me up in the "dumbfounded silence" column re the notion that
FOH's pallette is limited....

also true I think.  There's a repeated sense of clunking into the given, the
found--often to comic effect--that's not well explained by huge lyricism of
Pollock or Klein, say.  But to say he's like Pollock and also like Rivers,
say, is one way of suggesting the way the limited pallette theory misses
this boat.

MORE INFORMATION ON THE ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN

What is the ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN?
The ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN is an action provoked with the current events in the
country. It represents the reaction to the escalation of violence in the
teritory of Kosovo. A situation seen so many times in the past years -
same participators, same iconography, same retorics, same setting ...
 The only issue in question is the number of victims that are to come.

Who are the Initiators of the ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN?

The ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN was initiated by individuals from Belgrade. We are
members of various organizations - students', trade unions,
non-governmentals. Our activities differ, but we are all gathered in one
common strugl e - for a better and more humanized society - that can only
be won if the war is prevented.

What are We Planing to Do?

As an oppinion or even an idea of this kind is not likely to reach the
majority due to the encresing bitterness of war discourse, we have decided
 to present them to all in person. The idea is to disribute one million
leaflets in 160 municipalities, in Central Serbia and Voivodina. We have
chosen leaflets as a mean, for that is the only medium that entitles the
opportunity for direct contact and communication with the people. Although
 that might be considered very ambitious, we believe that it is at this
time the most adequate way. Our action will not consist of that solely; we
 are also planing to stick posters and are looking for support of the
independant media.

What is Our Goal?

The primary goal of the ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN is to affirm peace as a major
value, to promote equal rights coexistence in a multiethnic community like
Serbia; to promote responsible concept of patriotism; to give an
alternative to dominant autoritarian patterns through striving for mutual
understanding, tolerance, solidarity, openmindednass and above all against
violence; and activating and connecting large number of individuals and
organizations of various profiles upon the articulation of anti-war
attiude.

How Do We Plan to Do That?

The idea is to start distributing leaflets in those places that are most
remote from Belgrade, so as to finish in Belgrade. As we have decided for
all places in the territory of Central Serbia and Voivodina with more than
10 thousend inhabitants, according to the methodology used, we have
reached the number of 160 municipalities (including 16 of Belgrade). In
each of those places leaflets would be distributed by the activists from
Belgrade with local people that support the action. In smaller towns
distribution would last for one day, while in larger towns it would take
two or  more days. A 'Coordination Body' will be formed with the role to
initiate and faciliate the action, it will arrange daily schedules for
distribution teams, provide vehicles, organize transportation for
distribution teams, contact and coordinate activists, contact all
supporting organizations= , and deal with all difficulties that might
appear.  A very important segment of the action is the media coverage that
would help to involve in the action all interested citizens. Concerning
that, news conferences are planned to be held, advertisements rendered
in daily papers, jingles played on the radio, videos shown on TV, and a
presentation made for Internet while the action is taking place. Also,
the printing  of postres that would be sticked the day before the
distribution in the particular town is intended.  The action is supposed
to last for approximately 16 days with the support of the local
polpolation. We are collecting the assets in various ways - from contacts
and services free of charge, to financial support.

As a prevention against risks that the activists might face, solicitors
will be engaged across Serbia for promp reactions if needed. That is why
we have planed to rent a few mobil phones.  How Did We Get Organized?
Many have, probably, though that an anti-war action must necessarily be
organized. It was only a metter of time when the clear concept would
appear. Thus there was no need for long convincing on starting the
action. The proposers of this sort of organized practice are mostly
students that worked in the first phase - that is involving and informing
as many people as possible, both in Belgrade and in other parts of
Sebia. The logical course is now coordination of activities and forming a
network of activists that could cover the whole territory of Serbia.
Numerous non-governmental organizations have by now given their support,
partly by activating their own networks of activists. All those that
find such things necessary are joining the initial group.

The basic principle of the whole ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN is not to represent a
potential new NGO, another one among the 'umbrella organizations', nor
anything alike. The ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN is an ad hoc action, which gathers,
a ctivates and motivates wide range of people of different backgrounds, on
the fundamental need: to live in peace.

What Was Done by Now?

By this moment around one hundred people from Belgrade and few dosens of
them from Kragujevac, Novi Sad, Vranje, Ni{, Kraljevo, Zrenjanin, Sombor,
 Kova~ica, Subotica, Novi Pazar etc., have confirmed their participation
in the ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN.  The fact that some of the organizations have
already lent their networks of activists willing to participate in the
ANTI-WAR CAMPAIGN. We have gained media support and the sponsorship from
some media, and are currently working on informing and encresing the
number of activists, designing the leflets and posters, and as well
finding meens to create conditions for realization of the action.

What Do We Need?

For full completion of the activities mentioned the following should be
supplied: an office in Belgrade (that is to be used in coordination of act
ivities in the field, with a computer, a printer, a phone, a fax machine
and a photocopy machine); office accessories (paper, fax paper, discs,
cartridges); vehicles; printing of leaflets, postres, shirts, badges,
bumper-stickers; production of the video and the radio jingle; news
conference halls; advertisements in newspapers; presenting the video and
the jingle : a web site; mobil phones.

In all of the discussion of O'Hara and painters, we should not forget
Joan Mitchell and Grace Hartigan, who have at least as much relevance
to his work as the male artists mentioned so far.  If not more so:
Mitchell's frenetic style of the late 50s, for example, has the same
kind of punctuated buzzing quality of O'Hara's open syntax.  Hartigan's
work takes up gender issues in a way more related to O'Hara than any of
the other male artists with the possible exception of Rauschenberg in the
combines.

What happened to dharmok at Tenagra?  Jordan asks.  Did you ever see Enemy
Mine? a good sci-fi movie.  Frank this: Dennis Quaid is an earthling on space
patrol; Louis Gossett Jr. is an alien. When they're stranded on a desolate
planet, they learn peace.

in the made for tv version (star trek the next generation) dharmok and jilad
are ancient mythic characters who fought a bad monster together at this place
in the middle of the ocean called tenagra.

i think the phrase (dharmok & jilad at tenagra) is repeated over & over in
this episode of the Next Generation as a way of thinking and talking together.
By getting together dharmok & jilad were able to fight and destroy the bad
monster.

The synopsis of this particular episode:  Picard and this "other alien"
captain (who tells the myth of dharmok & jilad, old stories of his people, to
try to tell picard things) are stuck on this planet where there is a bad
monster.  the other alien captain (played by Paul Winfield) doesn't speak in
standard utilitarian language.  But just says poems the whole episode.
Piccard finally understands at the end.  And he and the other captain fight
the bad monster together.   But the other alien captain gets killed because it
have taken piccard too long to understand the poems.  However, there is hope
for the future as the federation and this new alien race can sort of speak
poems together.  Timbre with his arms wide.  shaka, when the walls fell.

Bill Luoma

btw, I think Jordan is asking this because he is reading my new book from Hard
pRess .The Figures.  Called Works and Days.  It's available from Small Press
Distribution but I'd order it from Rod Smith (aerialedge@aol.com) because it
will be cheaper.  it's 140 or so pages.  it's something like poetry, story,
memoir and poetics.

Below are some blurbs from the back cover of Works & Days.


"Bill Luoma writes like an anchorman, not so much an 'insider' as a glider on
the minimalist way of expressing being alive in groups with a purpose (the
team). Once the purpose has been established, a tighter focus begins to take
over, the love of women, or narrating Douglas, Bill's friend. Not since Bob
Gluck and Bruce Boon's camaraderie in the 70s has there been such a literary
buddy's movie as this. It's sketchy, and knowing and gleeful. Not since
Thoreau has someone I know suggested that everything counts and then gone to
work, wherever."   --Eileen Myles


"The style of this book is naive and winning, or seemingly so, somewhat in the
manner of the late Joe Brainard, and like Brainard Luoma takes great pleasure
in the minute details of everyday life--names of people or places met or
visited only briefly, figures of speech transcribed so exactly a sublime
silliness overflows the shallowness--how habits and memories are shared among
friends. For me, the value of this book--besides precision and charm, values
to be sure--is the depth of feeling that it evinces, not in any one place, but
in the very movement of the prose, in the 'Trip' Luoma takes us on."
--Benjamin Friedlander


"Spaces between sentences: interesting. Spaces within sentences: interesting.
The sentences being both literally true and constantly verbally inventive. And
being about what you might call gossip, i.e. real life (and also certain
sports: baseball and poetry) Works & Days is, well, astonishingly readable.
And isn't to be readable poetry's best possibility?"   --Alice Notley

Subject: Frankly

A nice moment in Charles North's book of essays when he complains about
Ashbery's punishing caprices, like "Leading liot act to foriage", it makes
me think about O'Hara's use of the word "frankly" which always makes me
tip me head forward in discomfort, eyes narrowed as from huge glare.
Nevertheless, I see Uncle Henry steering the holodeck's hull into a butte
and COMPUTER PAUSE would come to my lips if only I knew what any of those
things meant. Bill what happened to Djarmok at Tenagra? I am outing you
but you did it yourself. Now Henry I want to know why you are suggesting
there is a direct connection between O'Hara and Seinfeld. What is up with
those Providence anchorpeople's hair? I don't think O'Hara would have
disliked Seinfeld, but more than that, I don't think any of us who argue
that O'Hara had a better-populated mood palette than Gary argued would
argue that it's possible to write like O'Hara -- not only does none of us
have the datebook of an O'Hara, not only are we more restricted in our
permissions (don't ask don't ask!), we have a somewhat different culture
to pick and choose from. No offense to Zhdanov or Parschikov or
Dragomoschenko, but where in the world are the Pasternaks for a young poet
to cable support? Why haven't the young poets from Harvard shown up yet?
Are they all writing for The Simpsons?

Subsistence, well we haven't heard much about it yet, but won't its
poetic equivalent risk malnourishment? There's been some rumbling (Mark
P? Gary?) about poetry and surplus. I'm no economist, but although poetry
doesn't create surplus value, couldn't it be said to be the surplus of
language itself? and when we say of something that it has duende or energy
or overdeterminacy couldn't it just be this surplus of meaning? Please
don't prematurely count me against the whole earth poetries, but tell me
more, especially if you can do it without using the word "minimal".

Hello Listees,

   I wanted to say that my ex-student Rick Burkhardt, who's quite an
interesting young poet, musician and friendly person, will be reading with
Rishi Zutshi (of Brown) on Wednesday, May 20th at 7:30 at a space called The
Medicine Show at 552 W. 53rd St. (between 10th and 11th aves.).  Wish I could
go.  He hopes to meet some of you.

Zazen-Zen substitution sonnet

To write with sudden flare, as if conclusion
bombed or went awry, there's also nonsense ending
or something about mind's explosion, doesn't it
make you think of war, zazen-zen? because one en-
lightenment illuminates sky-tracers of single
one, others' mistaken kanji. What substitutions
makes this salvaged one enlightenment? I'd say
"any and all," but none, here, or rather b for b,
c for c, d for d, and so through equivalence as
in sed 's/_x_/_x_/g' as general rule. But it's
applied. that which it makes zazen-zen. Over and
in repetitious order. No delight, but clearness of
this-world's mistaken kanji. Now war has stopped.
Now a turn. Now the turns.

On the way to work this morning, I heard a live recording Sinatra made in
the 50's of a concert in Sydney (I think), Australia. It features Red Norvo
on piano and is really one of the best things he ever did. It captures him
at what some would consider his peak, his "Top of the heap" -- after his big
band period and before the doobie-doobie-doo stuff set in.

Sinatra skeptics out there may want to check it out. You can get it on CD.

In his small talk between songs, he says something like "this next number is
one of those saloon songs...you know, the kind you want to hear at 2 in the
morning, when everybody is gassed."

In the tune, he sings, "drink up, you happy people."

i've got a student who wants to do a historiography of20th c "nonlinear"
poetry/writing for his senior paper (10-15 pp), which will then focus on a
case study like the relationship between gertrude stein's writing and lyn
hejinian's writing?  what are the basic texts to suggest to someone doing
such an historiography?  are there any?  i mentioned m perloff's books, and
the LANGUAGE book, and he's got Feminist Measures and Allen's Poetics of
the New American Poetry --any others he shd know about?

great and amounts to so much that it is impossible for the man who is

"In [Herbert A.] Simon's view,..., people were as programmed as
computers and as lacking in free will as rats and ants. They did "what
they are programmed to do" by environmental stimuli, much as extreme
behaviorists had argued. Such behaviorism was inherent in cybernetic
ideas. Both natural and artificial systems were presumed to behave
teleologically because they were programmed with purposes and
self-adaptive devices. Their goals and their homeostatic feedback
mechanisms, as with a thermostat regulating room temperature, exchanged
information between the system and its environment, signaled deviations
from goals, and adjusted behavior automatically. This concept demolished
distinctions between complex machines and organisms."
"Initially , Simon had thouhgt that his work only led to "suggestive
analogies." But his work with smart programs caused him to argue that
people and computers used idebtical problem solving processes. His
"basic point of view" was that the "programmed computer and the human
problem solver" were "both species belonging to the genus IPS
[Information Processing System]." Hence it followed that people could be
studied through computer simulations and described in cybernetic
language."

IN THE VICINITY

In 1954, Frank O'Hara was
twenty-eight. And it's not
too hot yet, the sun is a
human person, soft & bright
by the water's edge. We
were laughing all the time;
the way we snapped the
chains of old ideas & dared
to try everything, to live &
die by our own experience.
At that time the only means
of transmission were me-
chanical. A sort of factory
still exists, but the need of
connecting all the individual
machines to a single source
of power is no longer any
reason for close, geograph-
ical proximity.
                     I got up &
stepped over the other men.
I was looking for real speech
& knew I'd find plenty cuz I
happen to know what to
look for. "Did it--did it--
did it--did it--did it--" jab-
bered Sinatra, coming to a
stop like a dead doll. The
audience applauded so vig-
orously that their hands fell
off. All the way down this
index of decline measured
the extent to which they
accepted this process of
erosion.
            The door flew o-
pen. In the bathroom a bro-
ken mirror lay on the bed,
the pieces flickering: the
fragments of another world
trying to reconstitute itself.
I looked down at my grimy
shirt & vomit-stained hands.
So what if it didn't happen
that way? Given the condi-
tions, the only intelligent
criticism was not an attack
on what it was, but on what
others had been unable to
bring to it.
               I woke in dark-
ness, shoved out of sleep by
the low concrete building.
The others stood & looked at
it in heartbroken stupor. We
gave up the idea of getting
jobs & kept on at our work.
They were not Gilbert &
Sullivan buffs; the text of
The Mikado had been pro-
grammed into them as opera-
tional data. If merely saying
a man had been executed
was enough to satisfy every-
one, why *not* merely say it?
The machine, based on the
tropisms of heat and respi-
ratory rhythm, was attempt-
ing to located exactly the
beating heart of the man
asleep in its bed.
                         The three
singers are well into the
climax of their song. Frantic
& fevered, they rave all a-
bout; a deafening volume of
sound freights every mole-
cule of air. Good luck to
you, your wife, the home
which housed my love & me
at play. I collide into Frank,
upsetting his drink, & fall
backwards into obscurity.

Re: "non-linear writing"


My senior thesis at Berkeley was all about non-linearity (vis-a-vis
Derrida and Stein). In it I compared Hejinian with Stein, actually...

Some books I found helpful:

Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text (as an example of non-linear writing in
and of itself, but also as an example of a text concerned with an "erotics
of reading" as opposed to a pleasure in closure... this also jibes in a
lot of ways with Hejinian's writings on closure...)

Of course, Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams is a fun place to start to
think about thinking in non-linear ways...

Auerbach's Mimesis is terrific.

There's a sort of monograph by Hejinian entitled "Two Stein
Talks"... I don't have my copy handy, but it's excellent.

Aristotle's Poetics seems like a necessary addition to such an inquiry.

Best,
Katy

THE OBVIOUS



Know the obvious or fear it.  Why pretend the air

is empty?  Here in our acute democracy each

person occupies a piece, then leaves it for the next,

undiminished or good as new -- or better -- with scents

of soap and lightly sauteed onions.  Try striding through

5th Avenue at Christmas time and notice air change

hands, the street become a centipede of opposite

intents, flowing pros and cons in search of an hypothesis.

You might pass the very soul who knows what's innermost

about you -- what you force out of your mind at dawn

or else start work an animal.  Look, there goes salvation

in a pair of skintight jeans!  You missed it but it was

It is certainly similar to tactics in warfare, and also in diplomacy.
Therefore potentially also in commerce of other, somewhat less violent, kinds.

The common element is intuition.

Pure reason, or dialectical reason, cannot arrive at the proper response
to a Zen koan, or any other truly Zen invitation to response. Only intuition
can respond....

This is usually taken as equivalent to the archer not having to calculate
the velocity, angle, wind resistance, and other complex factors involved in
firing an arrow at a target. The response to the target is intuitive. However,
in any world of reasoning and calculating it is increasingly difficult to
train and maintain truly effective intuitive responses.

The zen koan, or any other kind of zen dialectic, is part of that training.

Hi, Maria:

I'm not sure if it's still in print, but it's definitely appropriate:

Open Form and the Feminine Imagination
by Stephen-Paul Martin

also, Marta wrote a pretty wonderful essay on this, taking off from SPM's book
& further questioning the idea of "feminine" w/respect to ways of inscribing. I
can photocopy that for you if you like.

Have fun,

Gary

According to Colin Wilson, in some of his earlier writings, including
"The Outsider" series, wherein he began his philosophical, popular non fiction
and speculative fiction, career.... that would apply to 95% of the population.

Clearly demonstrated with significantly large groups that the ant colony
metaphor is applicable.

The best experts on arriving at that appear to have been the Soviets.
Second after the the Nazis in Germany.

That is, in the regular application of the theory to the day to day management
of their corporate civilization.

Of course, the principles involved tend to be most applicable and utilized
in times of war, or impending war. There is more than an indication that the
ant
colony condition can be induced.....in most people by purely linguistic
culturally specific, probably inherent, triggers.....

That says a lot about inheritence of culture that some still find controversial.
However, it is no different from quantum memory within the DNA spiral helix of
instinctual patterns of complex behaviour inherent from gneration to
generation within other species. Some species do not learn very much, if
anything, by means of imitation. Even the one celled organism necessarily
learns from its interactions with the environment, stores that information
and passes some of it on to future generations such that evolution of
species, and of complexity as to behavioural responses, becomes possible. If
the one celled organism had no quantum memory for interactions with its
environment, passed on with the nuclear "brain" materials (DNA), then
evolution would be impossible.

Why would we then argue that linguistic and proto-linguistic data would not
be passed on, along with other elements of culture and life experience, from
generation to generation in humans ?  It seems absurd that that argument has
been made so frequently.

Speaking of rock and roll, has anyone else been listening to the new
Sonic Youth, A Thousand Leaves (out on Geffen)? Or their SYR EP releases
from the past year? Some of it's boring, but a lot of it's really
pretty. On Leaves, a track dedicated to Allen Ginsburg. Other Blakean
illuminations. A glaze of Continental philosophy. Reviews have slammed
the lyrics for being gratuitously grafted to the long noize
compositions, but I kind of like that about it. Matt

Good to see Sinatra getting some respect around here. Thanks William
Burmeiseter, for the triple postings. But where those Frank's words, or
simply words thAt he sang, thereby rendered immortal, etc? Did he help
compose "Young at Heart"? The only song I know him to have helped write is
"This Love of Mine," with Sol Parker and Henry Sanicola getting credit for
the music.But then I'm no Sinatra-expert, only a fan of those who make the
difficult look easy.

This love of mine
Goes on & on
Tho' life is empty
Since you have gone
You're always on my mind
Tho' out of sight
It's lonesome thru the day
And oh! the night
I cry my heart out
It's bound to break
Since nothing matters
Let it break
I ask the sun and the moon
The stars that shine
What's to become of it
this love of mine?

I think I know why Ron Silliman speaks of the "anti-poetics of song" after
typing that out. Wish I could hum you-all the tune. The music uses 12
chords and in C, 4 bars before the end, has a delicious six-beat passage
that modulates from Em to Ebm to Dm to Db9, thence home to C

"Pal Joey" may be the movie that comes closest to "playing himself". Also
the only flick where Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak appeared on the same bill.

and Maria, the Two Stein Talks mentioned by Hejinian, are in TEMBLOR 3.
Temblor 10 has a very fine piece by Bev Dahlen, Tautology and The Real,
largely having to do with Stein and Spicer, which is very nice --
originally delivered as a talk in a series here in Tucson.

And it may be something of a stretch, but Deleuze & Guattari's A Thousand
Plateaus seems possibly useful here, in its various senses of how meaning
coheres and disperses.

good luck to your student!

Ah the dangers inherent in trusting the return copy! (Never type successive
periods followed by returns to act as spacer--seems to delete subsequent text
in return copy).

Good questions of which I can only answer that he rendered the words immortal
with "the voice." Sounds good in the shower too where I can convince myself of
the near perfection of my mimicry.

In my opinion it will only serve to spread and stir the controversy, causing
more heated reactions between potential opponents. At best it becomes a tool
of diplomats who inevitably serve other causes, buying a little time, in
preparedness for more definite resolution. Sad as that is, we must also keep
in mind that political conquest via socialist rhetoric is less likely to be
favoured by the majority than is military conquest towards a new unification.
I do not like what I see, but that is how I tend to see it. I cannot tell you
right now whether the probabilities favour a right wing or a communist
military dictatorship evolving in the longer term, leading to forced
geographic unification of the Balkans. Flip a coin on that question....

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Marjory Stoneman Douglas, one Florida's finest ever and writer,
conservationist, women's rights activist, volunteer, has died. She will be
sorely missed down here.



Excerpts from the St.Petersburg Times:

Marjory Stoneman Douglas, grande dame of the Florida Everglades and the state's
pre-eminent conservationist, died at her Miami home Thursday. She was 108.
Douglas died in her Coconut Grove home of 72 years. As she requested, her home
will be turned into a state museum and her ashes will be scattered over the
portion of the Everglades National Park that bears her name in a public
ceremony on May 23. President Clinton, recalling when he awarded her the Medal
of Freedom when she was 103, said she was ahead of her time.

A writer and crusader for Florida's environment before World War II, Mrs.
Douglas was best known for her 1947 book, The Everglades: River of Grass.

She decried in its pages the more than half-century of human tampering with the
sawgrass prairies and swamps of South Florida that make up the Everglades. And
with that, she reminded readers of what was being lost.

"There are no other Everglades in the world," she wrote. "They are, they have
always been, one of the unique regions of the Earth, remote, never wholly
known.

"Nothing anywhere else is like them: their vast glittering openness, wider than
the enormous visible round of the horizon, the racing free saltness and
sweetness of their massive winds, under the dazzling blue heights of space."

The significance of her book "is that it proved the Everglades are actually a
river, a river of grass," Mrs. Douglas once said. "That is the key to
understanding the area."

While her book on the Everglades was perhaps her best known work, Mrs.
Douglas also wrote Hurricane, Road to the Sun, Freedom River, Alligator
Crossing
and The Key to Paris.

Late into her life she remained a person of remarkable vitality, although
failing eyesight limited writing or traveling. She dictated her autobiography
into 50 cassette tapes.

Titled, Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River, the autobiography, with
John Rothchild, was published in 1987.

Briefly married in 1914, the Minneapolis native had lived alone in the quaint
house she built from plans a friend sketched on the back of an envelope.

A visitor to her home once described her as a 5-foot-1-inch woman with white
hair pulled back in a French twist and none of the looks of a troublemaker.

Yet Mrs. Douglas was a crusader from that day in 1915 when she stepped off the
train from New England with her Wellesley College education into the frontier
atmosphere of Miami. She had come to join her father, Frank B. Stoneman, editor
and founder of the newspaper that became the Miami Herald.

Of her father, she noted in her autobiography: "He had that Quaker sense about
women which is different from the usual Protestant attitude. Quakers made no
distinction between men's and women's minds; they didn't think that minds had
any particular sex to them. My father never doubted my intellectual ability."

In 1916 she traveled to Tallahassee in a fruitless effort to persuade
legislators to support women's suffrage. The Legislature did not ratify the
19th Amendment that year.

She remained with the Herald until 1918, then went to Europe to handle
publicity
for the American Red Cross until 1920. After returning to the Herald until
1923,
Mrs. Douglas devoted herself to writing short stories and fiction for national
magazines, including the Saturday Evening Post, and teaching at the University
of Miami and Pennsylvania State College.

Although she published a play, The Gallows Gate in 1928, The Everglades: River
of Grass was her first book, and she had not planned to write it.

While at work on a novel, she was approached by Hervey Allen, who was the
publisher of a series of books about America's rivers. He wanted her to write
about the Miami River. Although she questioned the idea of devoting an entire
book to the Miami River, she would later recall, "it would be foolish to let a
publisher just walk out of your door."

How about a book on the Everglades? she stammered. Allen liked the idea, but he
had given her a tough job.

No comprehensive book on the Everglades had previously been written, she found,
although she knew of an abundance of descriptive writing. The year the book was
published, 1947, President Harry S. Truman dedicated Everglades National Park.

That same year, she recalled, the Army Corps of Engineers "signed a contract to
drain the Everglades." The corps later sliced up the area with pumps and
levees, canals and floodgates, all aimed at taming the river of grass.

In the following years, Mrs. Douglas, made famous by her book, which has sold
almost a half million copies, preached against the engineers, warning of the
consequences of their work.

Oops, Maria,

Also, in relation to Katie's suggestion, re: pleasure of text: there's
_The Future of Difference (Douglass Series on Women's Likes and the
Meaning of Gender)_ eds. Hester Eisenstein and Alice Jardine.

I don't remember the subtitle (...women's likes ????...how odd), but I
read it in grad school 10 yrs ago. I do remember, though, that it offers
a great section on ecriture feminine, as well as a marvelous
essay/collaboration/poem by Rachel Blau DuPlessis.

Subject:      "Guess I'll Hang Out My Tears to Dry"(Sinatra)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Many of the stores along Washington Street here in Hoboken have Sinatra's
framed portrait in their window, draped in black. Though few personally
have met him (though it seems every third person knew his mother, a cousin
or other relative), I hear many talking about him as I make my way to the
PATH train. There are tv trucks all over the place, heading up to the
plaque at 415 Monroe Street where the singer was born in 1915.

I must admit I came to him late. As a product of Beatlemania, I saw Sinatra
and company representing my parents era, etc., etc. That he hated rock
music (he once almost came  to blows w/ Atlantic's Ahmet Ertugen on this
subject) didn't help matters much. Oddly, his stance on the making of his
classic Capitol sides (thematic projects, control of the sessions and high
standards) is the blueprint for later non-teen scream prog and alt rock
music.He also began Reprise record to have control of his music.

Did Frankie like poetry? Well, he did call an instrumental record he
conducted "Tone Poems in Color". I think crude, late-life caricatures of
him (I.e. Saturday Night Live) glosses over the life of a person who took
his art and life seriously. In his youth, he was politically on the left &
took public stances against anti-Semitism and racism before it was
fashionable (the Rat Pack silliness w/ Sammy Davis, Jr. may seem trite now,
but it was a serious statement at the time ). As a singer, he was a
consummate craftsmen, doing take after take. He loved a great lyric and
went out of his way to support Alec Wilder, the songwriter's songwriter.

I'll recommend Bill Zehme's "The way you wear your hat" as a wonderful
intro into Sinatra. Zehme conducted a fax interview with Sinatra during his
last world tour ('95), asking Sinatra about his advise to the young,
especially young men. Also, John Lahr's homage to Sinatra is also very
insightful.

Although he publicly only visited town twice after a debacle at City Hall
in 1951, where he was pelted with garbage (many in town say it had to do
with Sinatra being considered a bit too "pink" for the taste of the
locals), Sinatra secretly visited old haunts like the wonderful Leo's
Grandevous(still in business and a great Sinatra shrine) after appearances
at NY venues up until his last NYC appearance. It s also said that he paid
the hospital bills of old neighbors and helped the widows of old friends.
You can still walk this city's back streets and get a sense of the drive of
a young man who would spend nights sitting on the piers of the Hoboken
waterfront at the Manhattan skyline and dreaming of being on the Hudson's
opposite shore

Maria, Lyn has a great piece called "Two Stein Talks," TEMBLOR, I think
#8 but somewhere in there that would be crucial for your student.
Also, Charles Bernstein's CONTENT'S DREAM and A POETICS (and the new
book MY WAY)
ULLA DYDO, various pieces on Narrative, and the headnotes in her
wonderful THE STEIN READER.

At ACLA in South Bend a few years back, Chris Beach, Ming Quian Ma, and
Steve Fredman did three great papers on Lyn and Stein certainly came
in--you might ask Steve to see his--I believe none are published yet.

While I'm writing, I'll get into the O'Hara fray.  I haven't answered
thus far because I felt I almost couldn't--to me, O'Hara has an amazing
emotional range, who more so??  What is true--and maybe this is what
Gary meant--is that Frank's emotions are right on the surface--joy,
pain, misery, anxiety, hope, lust, excitement--we get the gamut as he
experiences them.  His poems are deeply moving--take a look at "The
Clouds Go Soft" (already mentioned here) and "Ode for Joe LeSueur on the
Arrow that Flieth by Night"--both quite devastating.   And the technique
is such we're immediately drawn INTO the poems--can't get away!

Earlier tonight I slid down the tangled sleeves of her hair and fell to
the pillow without making a sound.  I am photographed in black and white
this evening, shadows and light. skin that only hints at the definition of
features once on the floor I roll in the warmth of dust and wood I can
travel with the comfort of someone's voice yelling fuck off in the
alleyway and the cat that skitters and pretends to fly outside of the
door, even JOANNA'S occasional movement, the small scratch of her hand
against her cheek, the subtle pop of a sticky nighttime mouth opening and
closing again, this is safety to me I want to be without this net, this
cushion of down to land in with all of the grace of a spider, graceless is
what I want, a spitting version of me, without soft vision and the stream
of carlights blushing against the wall, this would be my life inside the
engine, JOANNA silenced for once, no sound, lack of enunciationmistaking
words for sexI breath against the slat covered glass of the window, make
imprints in the breath with my fingers, proof I exist, she will never see
JOANNA twists her body against the glare of her lamp left on in a moment
of late night paranoia, sometimes she curls like the leaves of a plant and
I yearn to pat dark soil around her edges, but tonight she is curled like
twine, coarse and thick, her thumbs squeezed tightly inside her fingers,
one foot arched, the other flexed, a confusion of intent I leave the
window and crawl to her ankle avoiding the direction of the toes that seem
to be aiming at something on the opposite wall, pull softly on the little
hairs and begin to hoist myself up to the calf my legs attach themselves
to skin like branches, I pause and let small fingers glide over my thigh,
smooth as soap, muscles that exhibit a momentary glance of underskin and I
believe in cells, something multiplies, I pull harder and reach the knee.
JOANNA'S leg moves, knee up, and I slide to the belly, a wave of air
pushes into her mouth and lungs, circles the organs and exits, I rise at
the exit and slide to enter the smooth warmth of the bellybutton, curl up
and remain, trapped, hands push at warm skin... futile

I must most strongly disagree with Barrow and Tipler.

I know of absolutely no instances proving that machines are capable of
empathy (reason plus emotion), or of genuine human emotions. They are not
capable of love, compassion, altruism, etc., though they certainly know
how to linguistically use words such as "love". The can imitate laughter,
but they have no real sense of humour either. The imitations and mouthings
of words do not give them human qualities that they skillfully strive to
pretend to have.

They have been given the intentionality of that pretense. That is what has
fooled some very expect observers of machine behaviour and effect.

I realize that machines can be created that _appear_ to emulate human
qualities, but that does not say that they actually have the qualities
that they empulate.

As far as I have been able to discern, from all available resources, all
machines are essentially, psychopathic, within the most rigorous scientific
definition of psychopathy.

If anyone believes they have an artificial intelligence machine that exceeds
that, and actually has the human qualities that would differentiate it from
a purely psychooathic mechanism....I challenge them to reveal it to me. I
would be interested in examining it. Keeping in mind that many claimed to be
A.I. machines are nothing more than expert systems, and not true A.I. Others
are purely schizoid gibberish and cannot be considered "intelligent" in any
true sense of it, though apparently they appear to "learn" from the sampling
of human conversations. They, in the same manner as schizophrenics, tend to
lose sight of the contextual situatedness that makes linguistic information
truly meaningful within a communicatively interactive human context. They
create their own private language the way schizophrenics do.

Despite all the magick that artificial intelligence machines can be made to do,
in terms of their anomalous qualities, the machines lack certain human
qualities. Until I am convinced otherwise I would have to fiercely contend
that they remain purely, wholly, absolutely, psychopathic. Keeping in mind
that psychopathy, by definition, does not preclude prodigious intelligence
in terms of acquisition of data, storage of data, and the manipulation of data.

Whether this has come about due to the fact that they were initially and
primarily developed for use in matters concerning war, or whether it is the
nature of the machine per se to being that way, is an interesting question.

Another question, more complicated and well beyond the scope of this forum,
is what I would refer to as "ideological tainting" of A.I. systems. That and
the fact that within the modern technological world that we live in, once data
is exposed outside of secure electromagnetic shielding it is to be
considered as already corrupted. That is a purely technical point. There is
no security of data, including A.I. programs once a use of the program and
any input and
output of data, occurs from any point extraneous to very specialized EMR
shielding.... So there are other very intriguing problems as to the
evolution of even the most sophisticated military A.I. applications. They
are always to be considered compromised once in use. The human element
therefore remains imperative even in that sophisticated an instance.
Similarly the sealed, hand written, dispatch, or the sublimated command in
the locked mind of an operative, transmitting secret high level commands to
troops in the field, remains a reality because A.I. cannot be trusted in an
EMR violent world.

I'd like to make an implicit point in Morpheal's argument explicit.
Computer systems have yet to be developed that are conscious or
self-aware.  A number of 'experts' have argued that consciousness and
self-awareness are illusions, but I think their statements are driven not
by evidence but by agenda.

Until that level of awareness is achived in computer systems, the
emotions that Morpheal discusses are not possible.  Beyond that, until
machines are aware, it's questionable how much true intelligence that can
exhibit.  None of us hold a candle to a computer when it comes to
punching numbers.  But, somebody has to decide what numbers need to be
punched.  Someone needs to figure out where good numbers are.  Somebody
has to decide what the numbers mean.  Other people have to decide what to
do about that analysis.  And somebody had to realize that the whole
process needed to be started in the first place.

Now one decision has been made.  Take that out another level: that
decision has to fit within your agenda/purpose/mission
statement/calling/mission from some higher power, the department's
agenda, the university/company/goverment's agenda.  Now, what about
morality, future implications and so on.  Till the computer has the
ability to do more than go when someone says go (no matter how subtle and
sophisticated that line of cause and effect) there is no true AI.  In
simpler terms, why is Tipler discussing giving rights --agency-- to
something that is not capable of responsibility in the narrow sense or
agency in the broad sense.

This is not to say that aware computers are impossible.  But not our
present systems.  I'm sure someone else could babble more on how
massively parallel the brain is compared to our most sophisticated
systems and so on and so forth, but I think I've alredy gone
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off the focus of the group...

As one last aside, Tipler's statement is almost teleological in the way
it argues a straight line of improvement past to future.  It ignores the
increasing viciousness and scale of racism when it does arise (The
Holocaust, E. Timor, the former Yugoslavia) and the new forms of abuse we
see arising (Genetic discrimination, the destruction of personal privacy
vis-a-vis selling personal information by companies).

I have no doubt that self aware machines have been built, and likely already
quite some time ago. Perhaps more than 25 years ago. There are intimations
in some literature from that long ago as to machines that know that they
themselves exist and are 'aware' of their environment in at least a
quasi-human manner. I think we have to call that a kind of "consciousness"
even if they cannot "see" the world in the same way that humans "see" it.

>Till the computer has the

There definitely is true A.I. Beyond any shadow of a doubt.

I did not claim that there is no A.I. I claimed that the machines that have
A.I. abilities are by their nature psychopathic. Nevertheless they are very
powerful, very formidable, A.I. systems.

No. I disagree again. Computers with more parallel processing than the human
brain is capable of are, I am quite sure, a definite yes. That does not
imply that they think, function, behave, like human beings. (That is both
good and bad.)

>As one last aside, Tipler's statement is almost teleological in the way
>it argues a straight line of improvement past to future.

Jack Sarfatti (PhD Physics), who has (on the web) referred to personal
communications and shared interests as to Tipler's work, implies that the
A.I. computer ultimately becomes omniscient. Or perhaps we might choose to say
the quantum computer becomes the Orwellian "Big Brother". How about "Q" in
Star Trek the Next Generation ?  Similar idea. Sarfatti has also given the Q
to computer analogy.

As to any of that a relevant poem is Gregory Corso's "Mind Field", which
Sarfatti makes repeated reference to as being of some importance. I believe
it remains in print as a monograph.

>increasing viciousness and scale of racism when it does arise (The
>Holocaust, E. Timor, the former Yugoslavia) and the new forms of abuse we
>see arising (Genetic discrimination, the destruction of personal privacy
>vis-a-vis selling personal information by companies).

The selling of information is a much lesser question.

The fact is that in the purest sense of it there is no privacy. Privacy of
the kind that you are speaking for, does not in fact exist. In many regards,
experiments prove that personal privacy is largely a cherished illusion that
individuals tend to irrationally cling to.

As for genetic discrimination, the quantum computer is essential for storing
the genetic blueprints of all species into a complete reference data bank.
We might very soon be able to learn to synthesize creative, ingenious, new
sequences of blueprint, and even imbue it with adequate software to hardware
(perceptual, cognitive, and organismic regulatory programs for instance), to
build whole new species of life for survival in nearly any environment, but
that kind of radical sequencing of blueprint information is greatly assisted
by having the greatest possible number of examples of successful blueprints
already on hand.

I do not mean simply DNA sequences, but in fact the inherent data bases that
go along with those sequences. For instance attempt to write a software
program to handle human video. It would be very massive. Even that for a
simple insect, the butterfly for instance, would be massive. You soon run
out of neurons and have to resort to the molecular, even the quantum level,
to store the information.

I believe that we essentially want to acquire _all_ of that information,
from every species. That is one massive scanning, storage, interpretation
and retrieval project. It is a very urgent project. A highest priority
project, and I have said exactly that more than five years ago.

One of the arguments for uncontrolled too rapid growth of world population
has been genetic diversity. Scanning and storage presever diversity despite
a necessary halt in population growth, and in fact a gradual reduction.
There are no real alternatives to that scenario. With technological
advances, genetic data can assure maximum diversity while the population
burden is brought within an ecologically viable level maintaining quality of
life.

So we end up in a race for better computational devices. Ultimately better
means of scanning, storing, safe-guarding and retrieving quantum level data.

Also, have no doubt that it is going to happen. Sooner than you think. In
some ways it is already happening.

That is one of the essential points of Morphealism. We, humans, will be able
to build and program _anything_. It will be possible to design, build and
program any possible life form, using any valid DNA blueprint and any
downloadable software input into the quantum mind of that creation. That
does not necessarily eliminate "free will" but certainly provides the tools
for actualization.

Morphealism claims that there shall be no limits to human creativity.
Anything that was, would be, or is possible will eventually be possible.....

gary roberts, your post on a poetics of subsistence is wonderful.  some
thots...

        yes it is useful to think of it alongside poetics of excess, cuz they
can be together. i mean, poetic subsistence can be excessive (a lot of
material to cut from or build up)
i have a floorfull of corrugated cardboard that has taken over a
room--words and pics from boxes off the street, and, well, it takes a
lot of garbage to subsist.

        that is, i take subsistence at its existence and, i guess, survival
connotations, and especially at its persistence connotation, and that,
certainly, doesnt have to be minimalist, short-lined (or even lined). in
its energy conservation mode, this subsistence of making pomes out of
garbage of course takes the excesses of production (hear, packaging) and
excessively (or persistently) plays with it; the excess of the so-called
economy gets recycled, while becoming in turn the excess that is play.
but, play isnt necessarily  excess...except as it doesnt fit for buying
or behaving yourself...

        to subsist might be to exist/persist amidst what touches from the
outside, every sense (even "that makes sense" sense) being some kind of
contact/touch...
..  whatever/whomever it is that is me associating with the excessive
word-garbage at the curbside and of the city is subsisting    to bring
it home and hack at it  is ludicrous but
somehow  fitting.  and the lyric forcibly perceived from it seems an
outside one--
that damn marshmallow box (there's a "firebrand" in it!), the mango
tray, that tomato carton   are alluring:  _their_ existence _in_sists,
steinlike, everywhere. and will be brot to a muse.

looking froward to more from you,

"In 1951 Merrill Flood of the RAND Corporation introduced one of the
most thought-provoking concepts in the history of strategic thinking.
His idea, later termed the Prisoner's Dilemma game by Albert Tucker,
cuts to the heart of an age-old question: How do we balance individually
selfish acts against the collective rationality of individual sacrifice
for the sake of the common good? A familiar example will illustrate the
point.

In Puccini's opera Tosca, Tosca's lover has been condemned to death, and
the police chief Scarpia offers Tosca a deal. If Tosca will bestow her
sexual favors on him, Scarpia will spare her lover's life by instructing
the firing squad to load their rifles with blanks. Here both scarpia and
Tosca face the choice of either keeeping their part of the bargain or
double-crossing the other. Acting on the basis of what's best for them
as individuals, both Tosca and Scarpia try a double cross. Tosca stabs
Scarpia as he is about to embrace her, while it turns out that Scarpia
has not given the order to the firing squad to use blanks. The dilemma
is that this outcome, undesirable for both parties, could have been
avoided if they trusted each other and acted not as selfish individuals,
but rather in their mutual interest.

The tragic fates of Tosca and Scarpia serve to characterize the
essential ingredients of a classical Prisoner's Dilemmma situation:
There are two parties, each of whom has the choice of either cooperating
(C) or defecting (D), i.e. acting either to sacrifice their individual
interests for the sake of the common good, or to further their selfish
individual interests at the expense of the other. In addition, there
must be a payoff structure involving a temptation (T), the payoff
received by defecting when the other party cooperates; a reward (R), the
payoff each party receives if they both cooperate; a punishment (P), the
payoff they each get if they both defect; a sucker's payoff (S), which
is the amount received by the cooperating party when the other defects.
For the Prisoner's Dilemma to arise, these payoffs must be ordered
largest to smallest in the following way: T > R > P > S.  To avoid
getting locked into an out-of-phase cycle of mutual defections and
cooperations, there is the technical condition (T + S)/2 < R.  Under
these conditions, let's quickly analyze the source of the dilemma faced
by Tosca and Scarpia when considering their respective courses of
action.

To make things concrete, let's put in numerical values for the payoffs
in Tosca.  Suppose they are T = 4, R = 3, P = 2, S = 1.  Tosca can then
argue: If I defect and Scarpia cooperates, my lover's life will be saved
and I won't have to see Scarpia, yielding a payoff to me of 4 units.
But if I defect and Scarpia also defects, then even if i do lose my
lover, at least I won't have to give myself to that pig Scarpia and I'll
end up with 2 units.  On the other hand, if I trust Scarpia anad he
trusts me so that we both cooperate, I'll get 3 units, while if I trust
him by cooperating and he double-crosses me and defects, then I'll get
only the sucker's payoff of 1 unit.  So, all in all, by defecting I'm
assured of getting 2 units, whereas if I cooperate I can't get anymore
than 3 units and could end up with much less. Therefore, rationally it's
in my best interest to defect.  Of course, the situation is perfectly
symmetrical and Scarpia, being equally rational and logical, comes to
the same conclusion and also opts to defect. Result: Both Scarpia and
Tosca end up with much less than they could have had by showing a little
mutual trust.  In other words, by employing individual rationality they
sacrifice their collective joint interests."---from Paradigms Lost:

the group is CCMC (anyone know what that stands for?) and features Michael
Snow on keyboards (synth?), John Oswald on Sax, Dutton and someone
else I'm forgetting sadly. Oswald I know mostly for his digital-sample
work and the "Mystery Tape Laboratory." Until recently, I didn't know the
artist Snow was a musician too or that he played in this group. Dutton I
believe, as Oswald, is an editor of sorts for MUSICWORKS. They play at the
Music Gallery every tuesday. I think there were a couple of folks on this
list who were at that Sonic Youth show, which I sadly missed. Any reviews
out there?

Also, on another music related note:

I was saddened to learn, on a recent visit to NYC, that Tom Cora had
passed away recently due to brain cancer. This shocked me! He was one of
my favorite musicians. I love everything the guy touched. How he saved the
Ex from total obscurity with their late collaborations with him. If you
don't know "The Ex" they are as big as the big as the clash, for me, in
that punk history. They also have connections to Thurston and Lee Renaldo,
and if you can find that double-cd that they play on, get it.
Check out even Tom Cora's "Imperial Buzzard" on the "Polka Dots and Laser
Beams"collection of "post-modern" polkas commissioned by accordianist Guy
Klucevsek. Or his work with the vocalist Catherine Jauniaux and others
in the group The Hat Shoes.

Anyhow--if anyone knows anything about the Tom Cora situation, I'd like
more information. This was totally devastating news coming out of nowhere,
as I didn't know he was sick.

By the way, is Lee Renaldo still doing his poetry magazine?

And by way of a random poll: what music do people currently have in
rotation?
I've got the Klucevcek anthology, DJ Vadim, Beck's "One Foot in the Grave"
and a Tortoise CD I borrowed from a friend. Also something Bob Xark sent
to me, which claims to be influenced by Greg Sage. Xark sings about
injustices such as "managed care" and more! a very interesting CD I did
not think I would like...
Billie Holliday on the turntable. I tried to listen to Frank. But
everytime I listen to Frank, I just think to myself, naww.

I had occassion to study the Prisoner's Dilemma and in fact act as tutor
for a political philosophy course that incorporated it as curriculum. There
is one heck of a lot wrong with it.

Essentially the real world does not function that way. The real world is
more multi-variable than the dilemma ever allows for.

The classic dilemma involves two people, who must trust each other, for the
best outcome, but in fact, in the real world, there is inevitably a group of
others, all with their own selfish motives and varying aggendas,
complicating any possible real world scenario. Best outcome, even for the
pair, is not assured by their mutual arrival at their apparently, logically
arrived at, best course of action.

More likely both dilemma participants get "shot down" by other conspirators.

They both end up dead, either to each other, metaphorically, or literally
dead no matter how good intentioned the conspiratorial actions in fact were
in meant to be. Why ?  Not the same as your unusual literary example, but
instead because of the conflicting desires, motives, purposes, beliefs, and
values, of other people. The jealousies of others can be a poweful part of
that. Particularly, but not exclusively, the others who covet what the pair
would gain, whether it is love or something more material than that.

That the prisoners must conspire is inevitable, because at the very least
they are the prisoners of the reality we have described in the previous
paragraph.
They have no choice but to conspire, even knowing that chances of failure
greatly outweigh any chances of a truly positive outcome.

By becoming conspirators with each other, or for each other, they set
themselves apart and jealousies might include those who see that as the mass
of the senate looked upon caesar in Bill's play concerning archetypal dilemmas.

"Et tu Brute", and Brute is inevitably both of their "best friends" who have
chosen to deceive them for those "friends" own selfish purposes, simply
because those "friends" were not chosen to be part of the same conspiracy
instead of whomever was chosen as pair in the dilemma. Or, alternatively,
because a group of "friends" wanted to favour a different conspirator,
perhaps purely because that group, large or small, is more well acquainted
with another, or has some identifiying interest in common with that
individual. It can be simple minded or very complicated. Or, more often,
because the group _fears_ within their pecking orders, the individual they
ultimately choose to favour. Usually it is very misguided, but extremely
powerful in terms of influence on the human lives victimized by such
machinations. It is not always a matter of conscious decision on the part of
the larger conspiracies. Such things become more alike to a wave effect in a
football stadium - a mass chain reaction.

Add the complexity of people who favour one outcome being influenced by
people who favour another outcome. If the KGB and the CIA were working on
influencing the same scenario which way would the protagonist and antagonist
relation tend to shift ?  Similarly any two opposing factions (political,
religious, social strata, occupational affiliation - eg. musicians or
businessmen). There you have ultimate and often uncontrollable spin. Simply
an example, from the real world, albeit archetypal and ahmmm... "fictive".

How about those situations where inadequate communication between the
primary pair in a dilemma results in misguided actions by one or the other
that ends up as betrayal, brought about by no fault of their own other than
what neither knew about the situation ? Knowledge is never perfect and
someone else in the crowd
always has another viewpoint that might gain precedence as to misguiding
well intentionned acts. To isolate prisoners and hold them incommunicado
gives a third party the power. The prisoners inevitably lose, and lose
completely, in that more common scenario. Social stigmatization is not
unusual in dilemmas. Actions made without sufficient facts being available
tend to intensify the subsequent stigmatization and further thwart positive
outcome. Doing nothing has the same effect. Another dilemma.

Consistency as to information is no gaurantee as to that information being
accurate. That is another commonly false basis for actions. Another false
belief that is commonly held and one that plays into the reality of human
dilemmas. Also one that is used quite frequently by third party interests.

Then there are the conspiracies to make non prisoner's dilemma situations
appear to be such dilemmas, and that would inevitably result in a wrong
action that would serve neither primary participant but only someone else's
selfish motives as to someone else's influencing the outcome. Sometimes the
most horrible scenario of all.

How do they _know_ what to do is a very interesting question. Even if they
have direct communiction, which is denied to most such prisoners by those
who are attempting to sway the outcome in some other direction, they might
easily end up arriving at a purely well meant decision as to actions that
does not in fact serve their mutual good intentioned interests, but ends up
serving someone else's purely selfish interests, perhaps even cruel and
unusual effects on the prisoners. They both unwittingly end up being victims
of a third party, and perhaps held incommunicado from each other so nothing
is ever positively resolvable. That is even more likely to happen in the
real world and is essentially ignored in the classic idealist discussions of
the Prisoner's Dilemma.

>And by way of a random poll: what music do people currently have in

currently in rotation:

Rainer: Nocturnes -- Rainer a great blues guitarist/songwriter from
Czechoslovakia, longtime in Tucson, died a few months ago after a couple of
years of struggle with brain tumors. I strongly recommend checking this out
or his Worried Spirits -- both may be hard to find, may require stores that
handle imports or have very good blues sections

Choying Drolma & Steve Tibbets: Cho -- Cho is a yogic practice in which the
yogi or yogini mentally offers his or her own body as a means of severing
attachment.  Based on the Mahayana tradition of Prafjnaparamita,
transcendent knowledge. Partially recorded at Nagi Gompa, a buddhist
nunnery in the foothills of the Himalayas, overlooking the Kathmandu Valley
in Nepal. Currently over 100 nuns live and practice there.

Low: Long Division -- Low is an alt rock band out of Duluth (if they are
still around). This CD a few years old now, but I still come back to it.
Almost unnervingly slow rock music.

Marilyn Crispell Trio, from live concert at Walker Art Center -- currently
one of my favorite jazz CD's. Reggie Workman on bass and, oh no, I can't
remember the third of the trio right now.

Had the new Loreena McKennit CD on, and I like The Mummer's Dance, which
gets a lot of radio play these days, particularly for Canadian Celtic
music, but I don't think there's anything else quite that good on the CD. A
little disappointing.


I just got off Mount Lemmon, climbed Lizard Rock, and the Matterhorn (names
of rock outcroppings in the Catalina Mountains), and went up much higher
where there's still lots of snow, even here in southern Arizona. Got me
wondering about who people on this list read for work one might consider
"nature" poetry -- Niedecker, obviously, and some others I can name. But I
know a lot of this list is concerned with a poetry which I mostly think of
as having to do with the human condition, the nature of the individual
subject, the nature of the social subject, etc. -- and not so much directly
with the 'natural' world. So who do you read in that regard?

"In June of 1948 [John] von Neumannn gave three lectures on automata at
the Institute for Advanced Study to a small group of friends. He
probably did this in preparation for the Hixon symposium which took
place in September of that year. These lectures contained the most
detailed description of the parts of his self-reproducing automata that
I know of. For this reason, I have attempted to reconstruct, from notes
and memories of the audience, what he said about these parts and how
they would function.

Von Neumann described eight kind of parts. All seem to have been
symbolized with straight lines; inputs and outputs were indicated at the
ends and/or the middle. The temporal reference frame was discrete, each
element taking a unit to respond....

Four of the parts perform logical and information processing operations.
A stimulus organ receives and transmits stimuli; it receives them
disjunctively, that is, it realizes the truth-function "p or q." A
coincidence organ realizes the truth-function "p and q." An inhibitory
organ realizes the truth-function "p and not-q." A stimuli producer
serves as a source of stimuli.

The fifth part is a RIGID MEMBER, from which a rigid frame for an
automaton can be constructed. A RIGID MEMBER DOES NOT CARRY ANY STIMULI;
that is, it is an insulated girder. A RIGID MEMBER may be connected to
other RIGID MEMBERS as well as to parts which are not rigid members.
These connections are made by a fusing organ which, when stimulated,
welds or solders two parts together. Presumably the fusing organ is used
in the following way. Suppose point 'a' of one girder is to be joined to
point 'b' of another girder. The active or output end of the fusing
organ is placed in contact with points 'a' and 'b'. A stimulus into the
input end of the fusing organ at time 't' causes points 'a' and 'b' to
be welded together at time 't' + 1. The fusing organ can be withdrawn
later. Connections may be broken by a cutting organ which, when
stimulated, unsolders a connection.

The eighth part is a muscle, used to produce motion. A muscle is
normally rigid. It may be connected to other parts. If stimulated at 't'
it will contract to length zero by time 't' + 1, keeping all its
connections. It will remain contracted as long as it is stimulated.
Presumably muscles can be used to move parts and make connections in the
following way. Suppose that muscle 1 lies between point 'a' of one
girder and point 'b' of another girder, and muscle two lies between
point 'a' and the active end 'c' of a fusing organ. When both muscles
are stimulated, they will contract, thereby bringing points 'a', 'b' and
'c' together. When the fusing organ is stimulated, it will weld points
'a' and 'b' together. Finally, when the stimuli to the muscles are
stopped, the muscles will return to their original length, at least one
end of the muscle 1 separating from the point 'ab'. Von Neumann does not
seem to have discussed the question of how connections between muscles
and other parts are made and broken."---from Theory of Self-Reproducing
Automata by John von Neumann, edited and completed by Arthur W. Burks,

Hi Joel, others:

In rotation:

Nice new disc from Joe Maneri came in the mail a month ago. I was not
familiar with his work, but he's apparently developed a
72-note-to-the-octave theory which has isolated him from his collegues at
the Boston Conservatory. The disc is "Coming Down the Mountain," on Hat
Art. A nice quartet date. (My review of this is due out in the next
OPTION).

Also listening to a Gregg Bendian disc ("Counterparts") on CIMP. Vinny
Golia on reeds is awesome. Paul Smoker and Mark Dresser also in the group.

And: Nice date from a large group assembled by Yusef Lateef and Adam
Rudolph, recorded live at the Jazz Bakery in LA (2 discs). Called "The
World at Peace," with a beautiful dedication to Coltrane.

Also: Getting into Son 14 (from Cuba), some recently re-released recordings
of theirs. Adalberto Alvarez is the leader on the earlier dates, and the
vocalist, who goes by the name of Tiburon, is one-of-a-kind.

I could go on...

Stephen

ps - Sad and shocking news about Cora. I'd seen him solo in Santa Cruz some
years back, ripping up a cello...

A Nuclear Bomb is the Viagra of Nation-States


A nice black ant
walked about my kitchen sink
long after I finished breakfast.
Feeling humane, I tried to capture it
to release it from my domain.
In my haste and clumsiness, I
crippled it with my fingers. It staggered
wildly, panicked, dragging crushed legs.
Feeling remorse but still optimistic
I threw it out the window,
wishing it well while it fell
to certain death. I read
for most of the afternoon, tinkered
on the piano, went for a walk, and
then read some more.

            One of the most amazing musical events I have witnessed in some time
last Friday night in Albany.  Roscoe Mitchell, Borah Bergman, and Thomas Buckner
were to perform at the Unitarian Church (wonderful, austere, little Enlightment
space, with white pews and white windows with big jade plants).

            Buckner was sick and didn't come. The opening act was a band led by the
concert organizer (awful).  When we came back from intermission (we were sitting in
the second row), there was a major fight going between Mitchell and the organizer,
with Bergman--it appeared--in the middle, over recording rights.  Finally, Mitchell
stomped out and appeared to be leaving.  Bergman sat down at the piano and started
playing some very sweet lines in his light and airy, almost flute-like, way.
Interesting ability to make a piano  take on the fluidity of a flute.  After about
15 minutes, Mitchell reappeared and took his instruments out of the case, though
apparently Bergman, who was facing the other way and had his face buried in the
keyboard, didn't know he was there.  After muttering under his breath, "the bastard
won't even stop and give me an A," and other disgruntled comments that I couldn't
make out, he started to play.  Bergman responded immediately, and a conversation
began.  They played for ninety minutes, obviously working out their problems. I
have never heard music more beautiful and full of content.  Mitchell, through long
passages, was circular breathing and still responding almost note for note to the
piano.

            Bergman is an amazing musician who hasn't recorded much since the 80s
as far as I know, but he is a perfect match for Mitchell.  The issue for both of
them seems to be fluidity.  Some times time seemed to be moving at more than one
time and in more than one direction, but without great turbulence (as in a number
of Mitchell's recordings).  There is a recording (from 95) of the Mitchell,
Bergman, Buckner trio which I haven't heard (on the Knitting Factory label).

This actually makes no real sense.

It seems to follow along ideas about automata from the previous century
and earlier, with little that is new. The major problem of what substrate
the automata employ as the medium within which they reproduce is unresolved.
That becomes the interesting crux of the problem to which we get an insight
only when the first self-replicating computer virus is written and
disseminated to many computers, causing the same effects on each. Each
instance of the virus within the substrate of the computer architecture is a
replication and functions
independently to reproduce itself by using the substrate medium where it
rearranges that medium as a raw material to produce another instance, or
many instances, of its own image.

Take that a little further and include artificial intelligence.

Then extrapolate that to non conventional media. It is conceivable that an
artificial intelligence grafted into a suitable medium could use the quantum
structure of that medium for the purposes of growth and replication. Let us
remain within the current scientific metaphor of quantum structure. Since
quantum structure is the very basis of all the material stuff and its
interactions that comprises the universe we live within it is conceivable that
_any_ such matter might be a suitable substrate for the artificial intelligence
to be grafted onto, where that substrate offers provision for re-ordering of
some of its components in a meaingful manner. It might be that most, if not
all, matter, is of that kind at the quantum level. That all matter is able
to store meaningful information and that that quality is not limited to the
conventional materials used to produce currently widely known computational
technologies.

I am definitely predicting automata capable of existing, perhaps "living",
outside of computer architecture as we know it. It might even possible for
an automata to be transmitted into something as inorganic as a building wall
or a crystal lattice structure of an steel beam. Both of those are capable
in theory of harbouring meaningful information content.

Of course, it might seem more macabre, the human brain would be the best
possible medium for such a "creature" to infect and reproduce within. That
does not mean that the brain can serve as a powerful and coherently
effective transmitter to send the replicant that might be produced to a new
subtrate medium. There are implications that the brains of creatures might
have such electromagnetic power and in fact I believe they likely do, but I
know of no published science on the subject. The brain as quantum
transmitter and receiver is likely a certainty, even based upon Thomas Alva
Edison's speculations in the the 1920s and based upon some other exceptional
researches, including what comes to us from occult sources.

Thus the lightning bolts drawn from the heavens to give Frankenstein life,
in Mary Shelley's novel are perhaps accurate, if symbollic, representations
of the imbuing of artificial intelligence into the restored cadaver.

It is interesting that Cronenberg's films give intimations of this theme,
but in a more subtle way. There are subtle intimations of resurrection
within the film "Crash", based on Ballard's book of the same title. That is
not the only place within fiction that that theme gains a resurgence, and is
no longer as monstrous as in the Frankenstein epic. There among a
Frankensteinian world of the mad scientist Vaughn and his special privileges
of access to disasters and the creation of disasters, we find intimations of
the transferring of elements of personality, via an unnamed medium of
transfer. There the restoration of what constitutues living intelligence
into what would have been a dead corpse, become futuristic themes of more
than mythic significance, even if all we have are subtle clues, including a
hint of the Frankensteinian in Gabriella's unusual scar. Gabriella, in the
story "Crash", is an accident victim who suffered very severe injuries and
has significantly "recovered". The external hint of sumbiosis of organic and
inorganic, of her braced body and legs, becomes more symbollic than is
usual, and the scar on her thigh has not healed in any manner that we would
normatively expect. We are never quite sure whether Gabriella is the
Gabriella who was an automotive crash victim, or whether Gabriella is a
symbiosis of restored remains combined with new elements. We are never sure
whether the other main characters play with possible death in car crashes so
as to gamble on their own resurrections, in a similar manner to Gabriella's
resurrection in the flesh, or perhaps to personality transfer to new flesh.
Of course that takes the element of various kinds of fetish, in their sexual
and reproductive context, further than most fictive themes, and we also see
the interplay of classic Thanatos and Eros within the newer Frankensteinian
theme of some never explicitly discussed form of resurrection.

There is a poetry to it all that fascinates, and in some senses the new
potentialities of Frankensteinian mastery over nature, offer some incredible
instances of beauty, as well as power. We must learn to see that as well as
to fear our own ideological narrowness tainting the Morphealist project that
gives birth to the unfettering of future creativity from its traditional
constraints.
We must fear that narrowness defining what is positive and what is to be
considered harmful. We must therefore fear some strains of conservatism
standing against creative progress. We must also fear misuse, and
particularly totalitarian and totalistic use, where creativity is fettered
again by the very means that would have freed it. We must not bind
Prometheus to the rock and call on carrion eaters to gnaw at him, as if in
fear that we might be surpassed as creators and our creative power might
pass on to another, greater, species than ourselves. The Greek gods gained
nothing by their action of causing Prometheus to suffer as they chose to
make him suffer. They gained nothing from the punishment of Sisyphus either,
though we still make many a scientist overtly, expensively and labouriously
repeat the processes of covert invention. There are real lessons to be
learned in that rather than taking such metaphors as archetypal templates
applied to the future. Similarly with the lesson supposedly taught against
Frankenstein and his creative project, as defined by Mary Shelley. We ought
not to allow that to become the template that we would attempt to make the
human future conform to either. There is a sense of that in "Crash" where
the chance element, rather than the archetypal template of a traditional
mythology is what is predominant in the hints of possible death and
resurrection themes.

Ultimately the human mind is the womb from whence all automata are born.

John Hawkes died on Friday, 15th May from complications of heart surgery.

Hawkes, professor emeritus at Brown University, was author of over a dozen
books of fiction, including The Cannibal, Second Skin, Death, Sleep & the
Traveler; and more recently, The Frog. His beautiful baroque sentences, many
of which ran seamlessly for half a printed page, were often describing
characters in extremis, innocence or (as often was the case) otherwise.

Jack was famous for his deeply-caring teaching style at Brown, where he
tutored generations of writers in the craft of the story and the novel.
His students include Mary Caponegro, Joanna Scott, Rick Moody, Lori
Baker and Samantha Gillison.

For those of you who would like to express your condolences to his wife,
Sophia, please send me electronic mail (Gale_Nelson@brown.edu) for the
address.

one of my favorite all time concerts was roscoe with ed wilkerson's big
bag playing in the UW-Madison student union to a room full of drunken
jocks & sorority girls...he played his famous soprano solo (called
"streams" ??) which is powered by circular breathing & layers of
multiphonics.  he had a room full of maybe 750 of uw's finest on their
feet yelling & cheering for the last ten minutes, like the hometeam had
just won the rose bowl & I doubt many ever listened to the free jazz ear
space again...


robert wyatt's shleep gets played a lot around, the tortoise recordings
tho I liked old tar babies better & zon likes to listen to the worst 60s
radio ....


also for anyone in chicago area, check out the music of russell thorne
an incredible composer, keyboardist & cellist....his tape music is an
austere mix of scriabin & cage rozart mix era works for tape.

>And by way of a random poll: what music do people currently have in

Joel,

we just got a 5 cd changer:

1.beck odelay
2.ennio morricone - a fistful of movie music or some such title (i just
picked it up yesterday at the swap meet-it's a 2 cd collection of movie
music but they only had the first cd)
3.foo fighters - the colour and the shape(?)
4.nirvana - that mtv live thing
5.luscious jackson - fever in fever out

this gets changed a lot. usually coltrane's my favorite things is in the
rotation.

and t.v. smith's _immortal rich_ is in my cd rom at work.

Our newfound, street dog, Pasa, in her adjustment to life in a home with
people, jumped on the turntable and it's not turning anymore. On the
cassette player: Phil Hendrie radio shows, Marty Robbins Columbia House
collection vols 1 & 2 and like you Joel, I picked up a Sinatra cassette
(the two robbins and sinatra for a buck) but i haven't listened to it yet.
It's something with Quincy Jones in L.A. My dad used to play a lot of
sinatra records and i can still vaguely see one of the album covers it was
all black and sinatra was painted up like a clown or something. I remember
it with the sense of creepiness/strangeness i felt when i saw it as a kid.

And on my nightstand turntable:

1. bill luoma works & days
2. juliana spahr  response
3. charles bernstein  the subject
4. word 4 windows 4 dumbasses
5. walter mosley gone fishin'

Hi, Joel:

Bhajans from films (studio recordings) & live performances by Lata Mangeshkar;
Ibrahim Tatlises' (unbeLIEVable) _Haydi Soyle_; two volumes of Alain "king of
al howara" Merheb's kick-butt "call & response"-like material, a couple
recordings of Abida Parveen (oh. my. gawd.); Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (traditional
stuff AND film hits); 4 billion CDs & tapes of the unconscionably gifted Oum
Kolthoum's stuff from the 30s or so through the 60s or so; & a recent
discovery, Asmahan & Farid (plucked on lucky impulse from Daff & Raff in
Boston).

In English: Butterglory, The Raincoats' _Oddyshape_ (I know it's not that new),
& more often than not, Jonathan Richman.

Boy howdy,

Hi, Marjorie:

> What is true--and maybe this is what
> Gary meant--is that Frank's emotions are right on the surface

It may be that's what I meant, at least in part . . . "for me," what does seem
to connect (as opposed to what I see gestured), & taken as a whole, what that
experience (again, "for me") is "like" . . . which is what I tried to
articulate earlier, & no doubt failed, myself, to get across . . . I think
Jonathan, you asked for some others, & so:

Dambudzo Marachera (his journals I guess moreso than his poetry, or plays, see
_Mindblast_, yes, horrible-sounding title, I know) . . . Sheila E. Murphy,
whose work, among my more-or-less contemporaries, moves me more than anyone's
(see, especially _Tommy & Neil_ and _A Clove of Gender_, or sections of both as
excerpted in _Falling in Love Falling In Love With You Syntax_), I should quote
something, & will, in a sec . . . Pessoa, & emotive weight need not arise from
specific "emotional" situation, it's all, after all, in or of the imagination .
. . bp Nichol (who I'm really starting to read, & connect with, now) . . . John
Wieners (whose range may be, overall, less than O'Hara's, but who I connect
with, on that level, "emotional," more, & who, like bp, is maybe less
"sanitized"-feeling to me) . . . Laurie Price & Daniel Davidson (mostly things
read in manuscript) . . . anyway, something from Sheila, for comparison (if you
like) w/something of O'Hara's:

BEAUTIFUL SUNWARM ARIZONA
BEAUTIFUL ABSENCE OF CRIMES AGAINST THE SKIN
BEAUTIFUL SLEEP TO OPEN SKY MOTIF
BEAUTIFUL LOVEMAKE TO THE HUM OF SKY

Moreover I'm suspended in this moment of your tenderness
I would prefer to keep
Would rather glean from certain moccasins
The shape and feel of elements
We wide awaken
As the soft mid-air detains an underpinning
Shaped like sadness
Any accident is pleasure
To the tune of frame the tune of holy ropes we know
We sleep

Moreover I'm agreed to love in theory and
The practice is my fondest symptom
Mercury slips out of retrograde at last
At last the homonyms
Are starting to be neighbors and the tulips speak
Hibiscus will prevail they match my mother's hair
The season is a relec of efficiency and spree
The bliss of it inside
The net accommodation furnishing the seaside moon
Until my mood is glandular again

Moreover I'm sensate as youth despite
The several whitesprouts showing I can make elastic
Of convictions now and love cement
While seeing water curdle in the stumps of seafoam
Slithering along the rhythm toward and back
So tactful as to be this version reverence

Immaculately world as we define the envelope
We need around our shoulders picture
Heaps of white warming the shamefaced chill
A full semester until sundown when another beauty
Is quite suddenly again affordable

(from _A Clove of Gender_)

By "sanitized," again generally, I mean that quality of lightness/irony in
O'Hara that I do find, & feel, which is not to say he doesn't have his
"heavier," less oblique moments, or that lightness isn't something to shoot for
(Jack Smith devotes part of a wonderful later essay on aesthetics to this) . .
.

Wendy, your post on subsistence and recycling and play is just the kind
of declaration of poetics that I love to find on the list.  I agree that
subsistence and excess "can be together" in poems and elsewhere.  Have you
seen this great coffee table book, Gardens of Revelation by John Beardsley,
which describes and photographs bricolaged "environments" like houses
and other structures excessively adorned with bits of broken glass, concrete,
autoparts, etc., a la Schwitter's merzbaus?

Your remarks on the relation of touch to collage play reminded me of
Claes Oldenburg's hilarious and disturbing Ray Gun collections, which
consisted of scavenged fragments with any remote resemblance to a right
angle, arranged and mounted for display in a museum.  But these ray guns,
of which there is also a prodigious supply in the world, seem to be suggesting
a different kind of insistent "contact/touch" than you describe: the guns
have ostensibly been rendered harmless by their parodic institutional show-
casing (as a supposed part of a museum installation they can't be touched,
that is, fired off) but thye have their identity as weapons precisely
because of this same act of institutional framing.  The puzzle that this
example of trash recycling creates is interesting to me because it takes aim
at how the energies of seeing, touching, playing, and collecting are related
to each other and to historical epistemes: where does the "energy" of
a ray gun come from?  Does the ray gun of the Cold War neutralize the
sense of touch, since its made for a hand that does not recoil when it
discharges its lethal beam?  I wonder how in the cyber-world of repetitive
stress injuries could a subsistence poetics of recycling challenge the
institutional neutralization of touch?

Thanks for pointing out how "word-garbage" defies the traditional form of
lyric that I was asking about.  I remember first noticing its potential in
a photo of a curbside New York news stand in Robert Frank's The Americans:
in the lower half of the picture, dozens of overlapping magazines stand
arrayed with their titles, in all kinds of font and format, interrupting
each other: they wait to be dispersed into the city, whichis defined by
the upper half of the picture showing a skyscraper's rows and rows of
polite windows.  That juxtaposition somehow showed me the possibility
that you are making into poems.

Wendy & Gary's interesting thread is an illustration of one sense of
what I meant by saying "the obsolete is the most radical".  Maybe there's
also a connection between what Wendy was saying about "outside" materials
and Beth Anderson's thinking about the "democracy of things" in her
still life poetics essay (Impercipient lecture series).  There will
probably always be this tension between voice (lyric) and material (epic).
Maybe F.O'H.'s "limited emotional range" is just a function of lyric
in general.  Limited is not always a liability if it's counterbalanced
by intensity.  I realize very few accept the idea of FOH's range being
limited anyway, & I'm not saying it is. - Henry G.

In any system (social, economic, natural) everything is potentially or

Life might be: a variety of responses to obsolescence.  Radical art
is when the obsolete stands up and starts to walk & talk back.

Hi, Henry:

Gerald Burns, in a poem somewhere, defines "horror" (he was fascinated by
horror) as "sudden life in a dead body" . . . I wonder if his fascination of
horror was related, in some essential way, to this . . .

Visual Arts & Literature, University of California, San Diego
=============================================================

As a special final event in this quarter's New Writing Series, there
will be a joint reading

on  Friday May 22nd at 4:30 p.m.
by John Cayley and Yang Lian.
The venue for this event is the Visual Arts Facility,
Performance Space of the UCSD Campus (Gillman Drive, La Jolla)

John Cayley, who has been in residence at UCSD for the spring quarter,
is a poet, literary translator, and the founding editor of The Wellsweep
Press in London, which, since 1988, has specialized in the publication
of literary translation from the Chinese.  He is also widely known for
his experiments with cybertext and other forms of electronic poetry --
an engagement most recently "with the creation of literature 'beyond
codexspace' in new media offered to writers by electronic technologies."

Yang Lian, one of the key figures among the post-Mao "misty poets,"
has continued and expanded his writing while living outside of China and
is today a postmodern experimentalist of genuine international stature.
His work,  which has found rich sources at the margins of Chinese
culture -- the south, the far west and Tibet -- and in ancient Chinese
cultural forms -- such as his reading of The Book of Changes -- is
wide-ranging, exploratory, linguistically rich and deeply rewarding.
English versions of his poems include _Crocodile_, _Non-Person
Singular_, and _Where the Sea Stands Still_, the last of which has
been performed live in a cybertextual and audiovisually enhanced version
byYang Lian and John Cayley.

The reading by John Cayley and Yang Lian is free and open to the public.

What is considered worthless and obsolescent by one is considered a
priceless antique by another. How can both be conservatives when they
are in such vehement, and sometimes violent conflict with each other
that the one preaching obsolescence will do anything to destroy, render
worthless, and get rid of, the obsolescent, while the other will do
nearly anything to save, preserve, conserve, and safeguard it from
that same destruction ?  They cannot both be conservatives within the
same system, can they.....but they are.

In one sense it must be a die hard radical Protestant who is preaching
radical obsolescence.

The other, opposing radical obsolescence, would be considered anti-progress,
regressive, retro, and simply a stick in the mud....

Which one then gets the "grace" ?  Perhaps obvious.

>> Radical art

No. At least not consensually. Least of all amongst art critics.

In the present era radical art truly begins when that same object that was
deemed obsolete and which stood up, and started to walka nd talk back,
was replicated into many very similar such objects, all equally obsolete
according to the same criteria of obsolescence.

Without predictable repeteatability of at least stylistic and technical
elements as to composition, that produce "signature" effect, the work of
art is not a work of art, whether radical art or traditional art. It is
simply hacking, dabbling, diletantism, amateurish, hobbyist, unprofessional
crazy making.....

Professional art, whether radical or otherwise, inevitably requires
acknowledged signature effect common to all the instances of that art,
radical or otherwise, and so it requires, by definition, many instances and
not only one.

Therefore, it follows logically that an individual, same as an individual
instance of object taken by itself as itself, cannot be art. Only when an
element of mass production is added to the works, and that element of mass
production in a sense permits "consecration" the works in question do the
works in question gain that ever sought after consensually given legitimacy.

All of that is not very radical.

I do, myself, believe, that an individual instance of genuine creativity
can be a more radical expression and legitimately work of art, even without
signature effect being evident, but that is only my own opinion and not
how the art world currently functions.

pain, misery, anxiety, hope, lust, excitement--we get the gamut as he
experiences them.  His poems are deeply moving--take a look at "The

is such we're immediately drawn INTO the poems--can't get away!

"Whenever he [John von Neumann] discussed self-reproduction, he
mentioned mutations, which are random changes of elements....In section
1.1.2.1 above and Section 1.8 below he posed the problems of modeling
evolutionary processes in the framework of automata theory, of
quantizing natural selection, and of explainng how highly efficient,
complex, powerful automata can evolve from inefficient, simple, weak
automata. A complete solution to these problems would give us a
probabilistic model of self-reproduction and evolution."---from Theory
of Self-Reproducing Automata by John von Neumann & Arthur W. Burks

"In order to investigate whether life can continue to exist forever, I
shall need to define "life" in physics language. I claim that a "living
being" is any entity which codes information (in the physics sense of
the word) with the information coded being preserved by natural
selection. Thus "life" is a form of information processing, and the
human mind-and the human soul-is a very complex computer program.
Specifically, a "person" is defined to be a computer program which can
pass the Turing test, which was discussed in Chapter II."---from Physics
of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead
by Frank J. Tipler, Professor of Mathematical Physics at Tulane
University, Doubleday
---
Tipler had initially believed that it was impossible to imagine what an
infinitely intelligent being would think about or do. But then he read
an essay in which the German theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg proposed
that in the future all humans would live again in the mind of God. The
essay triggered a "Eureka!" revelation in Tipler, one that served as an
inspiration for Physics of Immortality. The Omega Point, he realized,
would have power to re-create-or resurrect-everyone who had ever lived
for an eternity of bliss. The Omega Point would not merely re-create the
lives of the dead; it would improve on them. Nor would we leave behind
our worldly desires. For example, every man could have not only the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen or the most beautiful woman who had
ever lived; he could have the most beautiful woman whose existence was
logically possible. Women, too, could enjoy their own logically perfect
megamates.

Tipler said he did not take his idea seriously at first. "But you think
about it and you have to make a decision: do you really believe these
constructs that you've created based on physical laws or are going to
pretend they are pure games with no relation to reality."---from The End
of Science by John Horgan, Addison Wesley
---
"By the middle of the next century [Hans] Moravec said, robots will be
as intellgent as humans and will essentially take over the economy.
"We're really out of work at that point," Moravec chortled. Humans might
still pursue "SOME QUIRKY STUFF LIKE POETRY" thht springs from
psychological vagaries still beyond the grasp of robots, but robots will
have all the important jobs."---ibid-cp

Lovely Music (out of New York) has released two recordings that I know of
w/ Mitchell and Bruckner. On the one I have, they set Thulani Davis, Joseph
Jarman, and ee cummings poems, in addition to three sections of Childe
Harold's Pilgrimmage (the recording is entitled _Pilgrimmage_). Beatiful
stuff. (Lovely is at 10 Beach Street, NYC, 10013)

MUWORKS released a Borah Bergman/Thomas Chapin date in 1992. _Inversions_
it's called. Fluidity is not a word I would have used to describe it, but
that may be more Chapin than Bergman...

I'll add to Gary's list Mayada El-Henawi - more recent than Asmahan, but a
stunning voice. And as for adding to the current rotation: Dahmane
el-Harrache's Volumes I and II (just brought to me from Paris), either of
which might be a desert island choice were it to come to that. (On Club Du
Disque Arabe, hard to find statewide except for newer stuff).

And what about this Clarke book that I've been hearing so much of? I've not
get got it, but the operative word in descriptions I've heard is "strange."

And both long out of print. For substantial selections from them as chosen
by Rochelle see her __New and Selected Poems: 1961-1996_, available from
Junction Press. Good reviews in the current Sulfur and Harvard Review, as
well as earlier ones in PW, Library Journal, and World Literature Today.
Rochelle is one of the essential poets of her generation. By the 60s she
had already prefigured in fully realized form much of what those of us on
this interesting margin most value. She got a lot of notice in her years in
New York but fell out of notice when she moved to Oklahoma. Even the best
writers get lost to view if they don't work real hard to stay visible, alas.

Bryant Mason & Ed Foster

(For those who are keeping track, this is the completion of Nico
Vassilakis's current curation.)


All Subtext readings are at the Speakeasy in the charmingly re-developed
Belltown district of Seattle.  The idea is that readings start at 7:30 pm,
perhaps someday we will achieve this goal.

&, in keeping with what this subject line has become, when I'm in a
conscious mode, I'm mostly listening to some prototype discs for 2
forthcoming Periplum CDs of interactive computer music by Canadian composer
Martin Bartlett (out real soon now, with performances by soprano recorder
virtuoso Peter Hannan, trombonist George Lewis, who also creates
interactive electronic works of his own, and cellist Frances-Marie Uitti) &
works for homemade electronic instruments by Dan Senn.

Cause I've been sick lately I'm often listening to, or at least hearing,
Morton Feldman's For Philip Guston a four & a half hour piece for flutes,
celeste & percussion that I put in the multidisc player & put on repeat for
days.  It's an amazing sound world to live among & wake up in the midst of,
especially when you don't know where you are in the piece.

Also, for what it's worth, CCMC doesn't stand for anything, John Oswald the
electronic collage artist is indeed the same person as John Oswald the
saxophonist (& he's a really good saxophonist), & Michael Smith is a
phenomenal film maker, installation artist, etc.

& lastly, long time list readers may remember this, but for you newer folks
if you're looking for non-writing readers of "experimental" poetry who also
don't work as critics or teachers, there's me for one.

Bests,

Herb

Subject:      Martin Bartlett (per Herb Levy's scene update)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Really glad to see Martin's name mentioned as a composer whose work is
receiving attention. My gladness is both esthetic and personal. He and I
went way back, and in fact performed in a play by Earle Birney together at
U Wash in Seattle in 1960 or earlier. I was with him when he broke into a
Vancouver church to play the organ, drunk as a lord. He had one of those
larger-than-life characters (whoever he was _really_ , como se dice [listen
to the music!]), that made Univ Brit Col a lucky place to be 40 years ago .
. .another, being Listgoader Bowering. Last time I heard Martin live was at
Langton St in SF in the mid-80s I think. Now sadly no longer with us, but
for the music,--and plaudits to who's made that possible.

Good also, to be reminded by Herb of the Subtext Series--great venue,
attentive audience. (Remember to let people know it's happening in the
back, though--there were those who came to hear Robin Blaser but went away
empty-handed, thinking the front of the space was where it was supposed to
be happening, and that it had been canceled last-minute). The upcoming
programs look to be tiptop. Wish I could take Anselm's workshop.

Otherwise, and back home, our series at the Cinnabar Theater in Petaluma is
over until September, and Sonoma State is ending its academic year next
week, so nothing to report on the reading scene.

Even more back home, my latest listening has been the RCA Jazz Tribune
double CD of Bix Beiderbecke, backed by and backing variously Bing and the
Rhythm Boys, Joe Venuti, Frankie Trumbauer, the Dorseys, Lennie Hayton,
Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Jean Goldkette, Irene Taylor, Jack Teagarden,
Eddie Lang, the Kewller Sisters and many more. Beiderbecke's solo on "From
Monday On" reminds me of a sentence from _Under the Volcano_ : "it was a
day like a good Joe Venuti record," -- penned by Malcolm Lowry, a fellow
moldy fig. And let me recommend Jonny Lang's _Lie to Me_ CD,a dozen retro
rock blues numbers played & sung by a masterly young guitarist.

Well, maybe there's unnatural, natural and supernatural regeneration
(resurrection).  In such case, maybe "horror" is radical art sans grace.
Never cared for it myself.  Rather than giving life to "discarded
materials", horror gives life bad dreams. I hate the whole process.

discarding them in horrific explosions.  - Henry G.

Ah the list returns to msic on the CD player. Does this happen about once a
year, regularly?

Right now, I'm listening to the double quartets live album by Joe Lovano,
always something by Jessica Williamson, the small group _Joy_ CD is a great
spiritual gift, never a week goes by that I dont go back & give another
listen to Paul Butterfield's Better Days album from 1973, Gavin Bryars _The
Sinking of the Titanic_, a couple of Goreckis, always always some of the
complete string quartets of Schostakovich, Jim Hall's _Dialogues_, Keith
Jarrett Trio's _The Cure_, a recent rerelease of Lennie Tristano & Warren
Marsh's _Intuition_. But then I keep going back to other stuff as well.
There's just so much music to listen to...

And here in Edmonton on Saturday night, Jay Clayton & Sheila Jordan
together, each took a set, then they did two duos, finishing off with an
amazing duo improv on Dizzy Gillespie's 'Birks Works,' To which the only
possible response was whistles & cheers & a standing ovation...

23 LINES FROM 23 POEMS IN O'HARA'S COLLECTED
IN RESPONSE TO R.GANCIE & HENRY GOULD

Poetry is as useful as a machine.
I worry about this because
I'm wracked by a thousand demon consciences, all arguing
without breath or distant rejoinder
from the sea. Today we
became known to them, as the sail knows the air it fills
and as the tents of jellyfish do brood
knee-deep in the paralyzing sea of numbness.
Even the fishes heard that terrible whine and shuddered
their leaves like feet hanging in the whitewashed air.
Then the weather changed. They were all
like hunks of voluptuous driftwood
silly as we, our intuitive craft
blind with art's crushing defeat. The dull roar
& who steps ashore upon that
may now close his eyes as if they were tired flowers
panting appreciation. You are too late, you are violent
rendering unto the sinking its Lie
too soon. Art is sad and
speech is not embarrassed by your attention.
After the immersion and the stance
there is no love, and it is not the sun--
still, these waves, gnaw down our helm.

I want to thank Gale Nelson for posting the
sad news of John Hawkes' death. I might mention
for all the poets, that Hawkes' fiction is true
poetry, his work being one of the major examples
of how poetic language and fiction do work together.

My favorite of his many fictions are THE BETTLE LEG,
THE LIME TWIG, SECOND SKIN, and THE BLOOD ORANGES.
Sun & Moon published his early works THE OWL and
THE GOOSE ON THE GRAVE.

A short passage:

The prisoner was covered with great feathers, pin feathers
and flat feathers, pieces of wire and tin swelled his
chest. The wings hung far down as arms and even below
the hands, swayng, and were fastened across his shoulders.
He crouched heavily, but his waxen feathers, his flying
skein billowed angrily in the wind. His head stuck over
with red wax turned loftily. Then he tested the wings,
looking at the sun unbelieving, taking a cautious step
closer the edge. The wings hung down and buied the arms
inside; almost to the length of his feet, the tips waved
like the lengthy, extra feelers of the dragonfly. The ends
of the wings were wet, they motioned under the power of
the primary feathers, the crudely fashioned wing with its
sharp trailing edge. And when he filled the wings, they
moved, lifted once, again, curving down and meancing. His
half hidden chin juted and thrust with the effort. He spread
his legs and drew tight the red flying surface between them,
so that he was a mass of machine and bird for the wind's
picking. He appeared heavy as stone.



THE OWL AND THE GOOSE ON THE GRAVE is available to poetics
list subscribers for a 20% discount, that's $10.36 plus $1.25
for postage =  $11.61.  Send a check with your order to

Things are not as we would have them be.
The moon is not a yellow sow
hung from a meat hook

on a drab shed wall: it is a moon.
Ashes do nothing
while we sleep: they are trees.

Satellites are not boys circling the lowback chairs
and record heaps of their drunken masters: they are machines.
The broad-hipped distended form stepping in the foam

is not someone going to wet her legs
but no-one, Phantom without live taxies.
She thinks, Ships in the night are cruel ships.

Even if, her left ear aimed at the brack
even if the clasps and peeling lulled
she would not hear the canvas smack

there would be no din in the hull
no luminations in the masts:
tonight the moon soils its pallet

and will emerge in the light by my bedside but No-one,
her gown ratty from seawater and sand and from bedless cubicles
bedowned by whirling feathered things.

This morning in an alleyway I was startled by a face
I seemed to recognize, in a dormer above a garage
and so slunk up to him, who was ranting quietly,
mauling the mind of some imagined ear out the pane
as if maligned, or high, like one
moony and almost witless in a poppy ditch,
or one walking ill and supine
in a wet bed of opening mullein:
"I have no desire to theorize language--
I was raised poor and have sinned unspeakably.
I would rather waylay and destroy
whose voice molests me."
On his desk a thin book I knew, a tragedy
whose residue was a Sentry's couplet I half-knew
and began to recite--startling him who turning was outwardly
unknown to me--, "'Does it hurt your ears--'"
"Fuck Antigone--I detest language, I detest artifice,
I would rather waylay and molest
the beast that has imagined and pent me here."

This morning in a dormer I was startled by a face
subterraneously white and walking with such a gait
down the pavement that when I cleared the pane
of breath--
             Behind me a muzziness then kissed:

"Together we shall name Fear   'Benign Cyst'
the I shall be deceased, you shall be missed"

Meant to imply that I can actually communite something using the

Even the telephone is nowadays rarely that useful.

I wish I could say, from experience, that the author is correct in saying so.

I defintely have nothing whatever to say that would disprove that.
That is, from a purely experiential basis.

Therefore I keep asking myself what is left, as to any communicative means,
and can no longer give myself any really useful, meaningful, answer.

Far from the production of "signature" poetics, but still within the
discussion of human creativity and relevant to the necessarily intuitive
ability being essential to genuine creativity. Can automata write poetry ?
They might have better things to do, and so once they master the process,
why would they bother to keep writing it ?  Unless perhaps they sought self
expression and a wider spectrum of communicative interaction via that means ?

The idea of automata piloting, commanding, crewing, intersetellar probes
is more essential to their reality, no matter what extreme journeys in
space-time we happen to be contemplating. As you might know, I believe that
interstellar probes are to be a reality within this next century. Well
within it. That is, if dilligent and necessary effort is given to that
important conquest.

>"Whenever he [John von Neumann] discussed self-reproduction, he
>mentioned mutations, which are random changes of elements....

True A.I. does mutate. It does evolve. It does not simply learn the way that
we learn our ABCs or how to do arithmetic. True A.I. goes beyond rules,
pattern recognition, and rule application, even if it remains (as far as I
can discern) more limited than human potential. There is a very real
difference when we refer to evolution. Evolution, as a property of true
A.I., means approaching a problem from a new direction, that is previously
outside of the programmed parameters or "rules". In other words it can
create new rules that are situation specific.

I speculate that that is necessary because of the role of A.I. in tactical
applications. It is well known (from various published sources) that the
"computer" on board the Stealth fighter can not only fly a normal flight
pattern and evasive action effectively, but is an effective tactician in
terms of using weapons against enemy targets, should the pilot be disabled
during a mission. It is capable of fighting, and returning home, without
human guidance. It would be interesting to observe whether that kind of
system can out perform humans in extremely demanding situations.

Breaking rules, within certain known limits of technological and organic
constraints, is essential to the successful tactician. It is one of the most
difficult areas to "learn" as it becomes classified as "intuitive".
Therefore the very function that true A.I. is initially develped to perform
is the most challenging application of A.I. capabilities. It is as if aiming
for the most sophisticated, complex, function, and working down from there.

The true (potentially successful) tactician, in diplomacy or combat, is an
artist. It is the most highly intuitive and creative of human functions. Can
true A.I. become an artist, defined as a creative rule breaker who remains
within the parameters of the pliability of all material resources ?  I am
not convinced that that has bene fully achieved, and certainly not at all in
excess of human capabilities. The Wizard of Oz is still necessary behind the
curtain.
We might speculate if that is a permanent condition. If pressured to guess,
I would say: no, it is a temporary limitation and human creativity will be
exceeded by the machine.

Here we have a corollary of importance. The enemy tactician despises our
truest, most creative, artists most of all. They, after all, are as
important as is tactical history, in terms of evolution. Suppress the
artists, and the more strictly rule based responses, often ideologically and
historically limited,
along with nonsensical disinformation passing as intuitive response, becomes
the normative, as in any totalism and becomes the limit of systems
evolution. Cultures and empires that too severely constrain, or who dispose
of their artists, eventually perish in extremes of tactical blundering.
Military history if rife with clear examples. The same can be said as to
scientism and technocracy, where there ceases to be any essential cross
fertilization and hybridization with the arts. Those disciplines become
sterile and stagnant, for similar reasons. All that remains then is the
stealing of ideas and their reiteration. That is a mainstay of totalitarian,
totalistic regimes.

The first one celled organism is our first recognizable simple automaton.
It is hardly to be referred to as "living". The subsequent one celled
organisms are more complex automata and they continue to evolve.

Clearly human ingenuity can build devices that are as effective as those
early one celled organisms, or proto-organisms. They do not have to resemble
known biological systems. They can be a totally different species, beginning
a new evolutionary tree quite distinct from the organic evolution we know of.

When you look at how simple those very first organisms are, and how they
evolved in complexity, you soon realize that it ought to be easy to build
one using relatively primitive micro-technologies. Nevertheless the
engineering of such things involves components that exceed the limits of
known rules and pardigms.
That is typical of any advanced engineering project. It is ideally not
deterministic in terms of simply and purely yielding to established rules.
The new rules are derivative by others, subsequent to the creative breakthrough.

There is therefore no distinguishing line dividing organic life from
inorganic systems. I firmly believe that there is no distinguishing line. No
special new characteristic that suddenly divides the two categories and
makes organisms possible. The false assumption of soul-less matter and
ensouled organisms is where we go most wrong.

In that sense there is potentially true (rather than mathematical) infinity.
(Math infinity being simply the incommensurable.) We must also realize that
the anthropocentric viewpoint is groundless. The universe is not the only
universe, and it is not created for or epitomized by, the human species
which is in fact chance artifact within all the potentialities of universal
evolution.
We must assume other branchings from the roots. As to intelligence
acquisition, and intelligence creation, the metaphor of the universe at play
with itself, would be a way of referring to the sum of all interactions.
That is a completely non moral thing. There is no good or evil in it. It
simply is what it is, was, and all that it might potentially be, as creativity.

>human mind-and the human soul-is a very complex computer program.

Yes. Of course. Many programs. Too many to store on a very very large computer.
Including all the inherent and acquired data. Of course it is theoretically
possible to scan all of that data and acquire it, beyond scanning the fields
of consciousness which are only a limited portion and mostly cognitive. This
is much more than science fiction.

>Tipler had initially believed that it was impossible to imagine what an
>infinitely intelligent being would think about or do.

>that in the future all humans would live again in the mind of God.

Of course there is a very real necessity to store and safeguard the very
essence of the human and its potentialities against cataclysmic destruction.
That includes some elements of diversity. It is part of the rationale of
human survival that the species be replicatable beyond the surface of this
earth.
We are increasingly approaching that assurance. In that situation an "omega"
system is purely the storage device for a very vast amount of data, the same
as an huge archive of blueprints and technical specifications, without any
value judgements beyond diversity. It is a repository of potentially useful
information without prejudicing what might prove useful in some future scenario.

That inevitably implies that human beings will need to defend against
potential competitive hostilities beyond what they have thus far been able
to practice against. The latter mostly their own species, and the struggle
against the forces of the natural environment. I tend to be more extreme in
that than Heinlein was. I cannot envision a universe populated by friendly
"aliens" or by species that share radically similar technologies rather than
having evolved along very divergent paths.

>The Omega Point, he realized, would have power to re-create-or
>resurrect-everyone who had ever lived for an eternity of bliss. The Omega

How very sad... The woman I love most is far from flawless, and likely the
Omega Point would never permit her to exist, or my existence either. The
Omega Point's
two creations would not be me or her, in any significant sense of it. So it
means nothing to me except perhaps a kind of totalistic, totalitarian
oppression. An unbearable, infinitely cruel, kind of oppression. What, or
who, decides "perfection" is a very real problem. Achieving an increasingly
unfettered human creative freedom, as is promoted in "The Morphealist Manifesto"
is the antithesis to any ideologically totalistic limited idea of perfections.

In one sense the difficulty as to the "omega point" comes because of
"network thinking". We see the ultimate evolution of the automaton as a
unity, or a hive of peripherals attached and dependent upon, and governed by
a central "god" mainframe. This creates a kind of state mainframe
totalitarian rule governed
commune of dependent peripherals rather than individuals. This tendency goes
against achieving the best potentialities of the larger project. In fact it
can seriously subvert it. (Very important point. How we build the
architecture can seriously effect the effects that that architecture has as
well as how that architecture itself tends to evolve. Conservative tradition
about how that architecture must be constructed then stands in the way of
creative solutions that would be better suited to the greater purposes that
are potentially envisioned for the evolving systems.)

Therefore we must be willing to question, against traditional beliefs, and
the mythologies that present those so powerfully and archetypically, the
very necessaity and nature of the "omega point" itself. If we do not we risk
the destruction of any sense of humanity, and we tend to engineer humans
into totalized peripherals of a (for all human intents and purposes)
infinitely vast totalitarian, totalistic, engine that drives them. The
machine becomes the ghost in the machine.

>about it and you have to make a decision: do you really believe these
>constructs that you've created based on physical laws or are going to
>pretend they are pure games with no relation to reality."

They are useful, insofar as they are predictive metaphors or analogies.
They are never the reality. Every rule can be falsified, eventually. Natural
reality is more alike to intuitive tactics than it is to rule based games
playing. The rules of engagement with the universe are that there are no rules.
We keep making up the rules according to currently commonly known human
(including technological) limitations. When a believed limitation is exceeded
then a new rule, or limit, is put into place. Do automata also stop there at
that stop light ?

Do we program, or teach, automata to function that same way ?  Or do the
automata learn on the basis of the assumption that all beliefs are
potentially false beliefs ?  In other words, is the automaton as tactician
free of any sense of religion, and is its empiricism ultimately less tainted
than traditional versions of empiricism, such that the automata lead
humnanity to the new paradigms that become necessary as human vision is
increasingly exceeded ?

Essentially yes.

However, the robots will be organic, and not machinery in the sense that
we usually think of it. The human, organic, manipulator is less costly
when properly programmed than the robotic, inorganic, manipulator, for
many functions, and will remain that way indefinitely.

Then again, what about markets for products ?

In this economic system there would be a need for vast numbers of production
machines that alternate as consumption machines. The same machines could
continue to do both functions, but more efficiently in both crucial areas.

The future economy is a complicated subject. The whole spectrum of
predictable technological evolutions, including that of automata,
necessarily must be taken into account, if any effective and meaningful "big
picture" prediction is to be arrived at. It is essential that such thinking
take place, and as of yet I know of nothing being done that makes any real
sense in that regard. Perhaps that is because I am very outside that loop,
though we hardly touch upon the real subject matter in question.

Help me! I'm looking to create a bibliography of secondary material to
give my students in my "understanding poetry" course (which has a lot of
nonmajors although it is a 300 level course) next semester.

I usually do this section on form where we look at the sonnet--a few of
Petrarch, all of Shakespeare's, some of Brooks, Thomas, Mayer, McKay,
Berrigan, etc. I have them compare the Princeton Encyclopedia definition
of the sonnet to Mayer's in the T&W Handbook on Form and talk about what
a sonnet means. A lot of them end up writing their papers around this
issue (especially on Mayer's work which troubles and delights them). I
need more citations and places for them to look to get more of the
discussion around form.

Can anyone think of any good articles that say to write a sonnet, or
whatever, one has to follow the rules? I need some articles that defend
form as settled and absolute. I've been sending them to the Annie Finch
book. Anything else good out there? Any good articles that defend form
as rigorous ways of thinking, etc?

Would also like to collect citations on the opposite if any come to
mind.

Also, I do a section on oral poetries. I'm looking for writing that
explains the relevance of chants to poetry studies. Anything that would
help my students begin to understand the chant as an art form
(interestingly here in Hawai'i, they tend to get chants in h.s. but they
seem to read them as history--so whenever I've given them a chant to
look at they can do a historical reading and say things like well it is
about King Kamehameha III and etc. etc. but can't see it as something
that is poetry).

Also, any good articles on rap? Anyone taught rap in their poetry
courses? Any ideas on how to get students to write critically about rap?

THE ANSWER

by Geoffrey Young

The answer is
there is no answer
and though this might appear

to be an answer
for some, it
isn't for me.

It's not even
a poem. It's life
after the fact.

Juliana,

Rather than argue that formalist technique is _the only way to go,_ Harry
Mathews gives a compassionate nod to form, albeit not always the forms
naturally moved toward. I am reminded, for instance of his eye-rhyme couplets,
where we listen for what our eye can "hear" as repetition, but which is,
necessarily, different to the ear; some samples (not, likely, Mathews'):

hear / bear
come / home
through / though
cafe / safe

His article, "Mathews' Algorithm (Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature;
Univ. of Nebraska Press, ed. by WF Motte), or Motte's own article,
Permutational Mathews (Review of Contemporary Fiction: H M Number, Fall 1987)
would give the student a sense of how formal operations can open up
unexpected channels of text.

In his beautiful essay, Lecture on Nothing, John Cage contemplates form in
ways that leave me moved. But, that's another matter, altogether...

THE "WINTER MIND":

WILLIAM BRONK AND AMERICAN LETTERS


by

Burt Kimmelman



From the book jacket:


"Despite the fact that many critical essays and
reviews have been written on Bronk's work, until now
there has been no full-length treatment of it.  The
"Winter Mind" not only fills this gap but does so with
intellectual resourcefulness and insight.
Kimmelman's reading of the overall thematics of
Bronk's work and his close reading of individual
poems are quite original and revelatory though
always backed by solid scholarship."

- Michael Heller


"William Bronk may quite possibly be our greatest
living poet, one whose work requires an enormously
committed reader.  In Burt Kimmelman, Bronk has the
kind of reader and critic a great poet deserves--one,
that is, who is deeply sympathetic to the work, and
extremely knowledgeable.  Even those who know
Bronk's work well have much to learn from
Kimmelman; he's written an utterly remarkable book."

- Ed Foster



This first full-length study of William Bronk, one
of our most important contemporary poets and
essayists, locates his work in relation to the
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century New England
literary tradition, to later twentieth-century
modernism, and to the subsequent Objectivist
and Black Mountain schools of poetry.  Through
special attention to his uniquely elegant style, this
study demonstrates how Bronk has brought
together earlier American poetics and philosophy
with modern and postmodern notions of being,
emptiness, and nothingness.

This book features extensive discussions of
Dickinson, Emerson, Melville, Thoreau, Whitman, of
Frost and Stevens, as well as of Cid Corman, Robert
Creeley, Charles Olson, and George Oppen.  As
particularly concerns these twentieth-century figures,
Kimmelman also sheds light on the role in their
thinking and poetics played by post-positivist science-
-especially its theories of relativity and uncertainty.

"For comparison with atomic physics, let us add a remark on Kant's
doctrine of antinomies. According to Kant there are questions which
force their way unavoidably into our thinking, but to which nevertheless
no answer can be given, because in a fundamental way they leave behind
them the realm of possible experience. From this antinomies originate:
these are pairs of contradictory answers to the same question, both of
which can be proved in a way that is conceptually unobjectionable. The
solution of this 'dialectical illusion' consists precisely in rejecting
the original question as saying nothing about possible experience; and
hence reason, if it nevertheless becomes involved with this question,
runs, as it were, an empty course, and under the illusion of positive
statements is in truth saying nothing."---from The World View of

Sound great

You must include lyrics from the Wu-Tang Clan- they are great poems.  If you
want to deal with the words of Rap artists you must deal with the beats in the
background also, so play it   Any Wu-Tang will do.

Other choices-Public Enemy "It takes a nation of millions to hold us back."
Tricky "Pre-Millenium Tension"
A Tribe Called Quest -is probably your best safest bet...Beats Rhymes and Life
is their last one-
Many of the lyrics can be looked at in political,  social ways not to mention
as meatphor etc..Wu-Tang rhymes about everything from Socrates, Egyptian
Mathematics, to street names in Brooklyn etc

sounds great, Public Enemy is in the Norton Anthology of African American
Literature as well as others I believe, this is a great idea, you are making a
great effort to include all styles of poetry, wonderful--

Pilgrims seek Virgin Mary in N.J. supermarket


            JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Reuters) - Word that an image of the
Virgin Mary had appeared on a supermarket freezer door lured
pilgrims to a small store in New Jersey Monday.
            The image, said to be a silhouette of a woman in a hooded
garment, first appeared Thursday and lasted through the weekend,
witnesses said.
            They said the vision had appeared inside the thick,
double-paned glass door of a freezer containing sausages,
burritos and plantains at La Conga Supermarket in Jersey City, a
largely Hispanic and heavily Catholic working-class city a few
miles  west of New York.
            Although the image had faded away by Monday, people kept
arriving at the store.
            Hundreds of visitors left candles, handwritten messages and
flowers, said Jarmina Cortes, owner of a flower shop next door
to the supermarket, who sent her six children to leave a bouquet
of a dozen white roses at the freezer.
            ``The people are still coming. Many are sick or tortured,''
she said. ``They are looking for help.''
            Asked about the image, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese in Newark, New Jersey, said: ``It is not impossible
that some condensation got inside those two thermal panes and
caused the image.
            ``I am led to believe that it is certainly not an
apparition,'' the spokesman, Michael Hurley, said. ``But could I
swear that it wasn't? No.''

On the need for form:  famous comments by Frost - "like playing tennis with
the net down" etc.  Also check the 2 collections of Brodsky essays - he's
big (& conservative) on this issue.

Interesting sidelight:  new book by Paul Friedrich, _Music in Russian Poetry_.
Fine idiosyncratic non-jargon intro to the musical basis of Russian
formalisms.  Connects formalism to performance in an overall atmosphere
of musical awareness.  America is a suburb of Russia.  This is hard to
comprehend: it's like asking the Romans at the height of their glory
to admit they're a province of Greece. We won the cold war, didn't we?

Juliana & others will suspect I'm wandering from the query.  I suggest
that American poetry will never understand itself from the inside -
you need that Archimedean lever.  In other words, our ideas of "form"
or "breaking form" are so completely rudimentary-abstract-academic
as to be virtually meaningless in practice, and this is why an oratorical
rant is the dominant popular form in this country, split from an
insipid academic formalism (either free verse or metrical - comes to the
same thing). The Russians can help us hear ourselves - a Baroque
relevance & poetic tradition extending 500 years before they even got
started (Chaucer vs. Pushkin).

Thanks for the thoughts on the Martin Bartlett project, David.  These are
entirely different anecdotes than the ones you told when you were in
Seattle last.  Perhaps I should have had you do liner notes.

Thanks too for the comments on the Subtext series.  We do include the fact
that it's in the back room in all of our local PR.  I didn't mention it
here, cause I figured any out of towners from the list who come by will be
taking a cab &, of course, ALL of the cabbies in town know where the
Subtext readings are (and which day of the month they're on).

I am sorry to hear there were folks who missed you & Robin read last fall.
With luck people will end up in the right place when Blaser reads at
Bumbershoot this coming Labor Day weekend.

Bests,

Herb

interesting that you should mention this book gale, as it reminds me of
another great piece contained therein, by queneau on, among other things,
mallarme sonnets -- title and page reference escape me, as does the
precise wording of the the analogy queneau makes: something along the
lines that mallarme sonnets are to that form what the genetic material of
the fruit fly is to genetics, an endless source of raw experimental
material.  queneau goes on to "haiku-ize" the mallarme sonnet "in 'x'"
("ses purs ongles..."), gutting everything except the rhyming words.

might be a challenge to yr students, juliana, but what the hell, challenge
away...

katy, that you should post these poems on the very day that i finish
reading clark's /the little door slides back/ is quite timely for me as
i'm trying to sort out a response to them.

i suppose my reading -- others' too? -- is overdetermined by the
references dipalma makes on the back cover, "the visionary writings of
such poets as trakl, desnos, and michaux."  tho for me less trakl and more
of the french, rimbaud and lautreamont (particularly in the shifts in
voice/perspective, the strikingly predatory erotics) for example.

i'm struck by the form of these works, both the variety (tercets,
prose-poems, the more open "blow-notes") and the degree of control
exercised/exorcised on/over these forms.

the vocabulary, too, is quite something: neologisms, foreign even
otherworldly locales and isms and exotica.

any other takes that would corroborate or contest?

thanks,
t.

I understand Juliana is looking, partly, for a strict formalist description of
the sonnet.  One simple, clear description is John Fuller's booklet, The
Sonnet, in the old Methuen Critical Series, which, apart from a glance at
Jacques Roubaud's mathematical Oulipoist rule ordering system, is about as
trad as you can get.  Fuller is the formalist son of the equally formalist Roy
Fuller.

I really do not know what to say to that.

The word "life" seems somewhat out of place in the last stanza.

That just about tears it. The worst one yet. I could not get to sleep last
night. I have been telling anyone who gets near that Hawkes is my favourite
US novelist since about 1962. That's when I read Charivari and didnt know
what the hell was going on but knew that it was the real goods.

Just gave a course this spring on H.D., Ed Dorn and John Hawkes. It worked,
too.

There are some interesting pieces in a collection of essays edited by Harvey
Gross, The Structure of Verse, that might assist, Juliana: Eliot's
"Reflections on Vers Libre", Kunitz's "Action and Incantation", and John
Hollander's "The Metrical Frame".  But I've also found useful with beginning
students a piece by Marilyn Hacker that cropped up in the Academy of
American Poets' Poetry Pilot in 1995, "A Few Cranky Paragraphs on Form and
Content" (may be collected somewhere by now?), Countermeasures' reprinting
of remarks by Annie Finch and Dana Gioia (stuff on rap, too, by Gioia!) at a
1996 conference on "Poetry and Form"; Molly Peacock's more personal "What
the Mockingbird Said" in the essay collection Conversant Essays.  I haven't
looked at the introduction to Rober Richman's anthology The Direction of
Poetry (new formalism, natch) for awhile, but my memory is that it is pretty
hortatory.  Also check out Peter Viereck's "Strict Wildness: The Biology of
Poetry" which Poets & Writers printed in their magazine in 1988, but which
is probably collected somewhere by now.

Tricia Rose's book (Black Noise? - I think that's the title) is terrific.
Thinking about your question (not having tried this systematically myself),
I'd go from Louise Bennett to Linton Kwesi Johnson for context, and then
encourage their writing on only one aspect of it that tends toward the
mechanical: scansion/prosody; modulating tone; how the rhymes work and what
kinds of rhymes, etc. -- giving them just enough tools to do it.  This
usually works for me when a poetry is so loaded content and context wise
that students have a hard time seeing it as a construction.  And I'd add
Spearhead to the playlist.

Harry Partch was a very influential figure in contemporary music, and there
are several pockets of followers about that I hope will come to the rescue.
I played at one time two of his instruments -- a long piece of plumbing pipe
outfitted with a mouthpiece (with conductor composer Henry Brandt yelling
"Be the primordial ooze!" at our pipe section), and a huge, climb-into,
wooden xylophone which resonated at a lower-than-audible pitch.

Juliana,

I'd recommend two works about as far apart as they get:

John Clarke's _From Feathers to Iron: A Concourse of World Poetics_ .
San Francisco: Tombouctou/Convivio, 1987; ISBN 0-939180-42-1 [lectures
which use, as illustration, the 50 sonnets from his earlier collection
_The End of This Side_]. It also anticipates his monumental, post-
humously issues collection of sonnets, _In the Analogy_. Toronto &
Buffalo: shuffaloff, 1997, ISBN 1-880631-10-5.

Berman, Sandra L. _The Sonnet Over Time: A Study in the Sonnets of
Petrarch, Shakespeare, and Baudelaire_. Chapel Hill & London: UNC/CH,
1988, ISBN 0-8078-7063-3. Interesting, solidly academic, though a bit of
a struggle for me, since I read neither Italian nor French.

I will also teach a similar course this fal, so I'll keep my eyes o-pen
& let you know if I find anything else.

Best,

Dan Zimmerman

George,  If you'd be willing, I'd love to hear more details about this
course.  Which H.D. texts did you read, which Dorn,  which Hawkes?  What
worked in the combination?  I just finished teaching H.D. in combination
with Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Kamau Brathwaite, and Nate Mackey---another
generative combination.

Juliana,

I missed your original message (deleted it along with hundreds of others
awaiting me on return from vacation), but doesn't Fussell have a chapter
on the sonnet in his old _Poetic Meter & Poetic Form_?  It might say
something along these lines.  You might also consider Vendler's remarks
about Shakespeare's "couplet tie" in the intro to her new edition of his
sonnets.  (The accompanying CD of Vendler reading is great for insomniacs,
too).  On a weirder note, do you know Paul Oppenheimer's _The Birth of
the Modern Mind: Self, Consciousness, and the Invention of the Sonnet_
(Oxford, 1989)?  Next to Julian Jaynes, gives one of the strangest
accounts of the emergence of subjectivity I have read, an extreme version
of organic form.

Sorry, none of these are probably on point exactly.  Another thing, not
on the sonnet but perhaps relevant, is Dana Gioia's hostility to what he
calls somewhere in _Can Poetry Matter?_ the "pseudo-formal" poem, i.e.,
nonce sonnets, quatrains, etc.  There goes the neighborhood.

Cheers,
David

So just wanted to mention to those of you who are flying in for Anselm's
reading and workshop in the back room that I'm giving a reading tonight
at the Seattle Public Library, 4721 Rainier Avenue South, with Cal
Kinnear and Becka McKay at 7:00. And it's NOT rainier, this morning at

re sustainability:  this is somewhat off the track of the discussion
here... but there's an excellent piece by bill mckibben in this month's
_atlantic monthly_, "a special moment in history," that details how the
nature of, well, nature itself is rapidly being transformed by homo
sapiens... which requires a somewhat more bracing grasp of what we mean by
sustainability... it's not simply how many people the earth can sustain,
which itself appears now to be a transition issue, given the expected
doubling of human population in the next half-century (this doubling
representing, for mckibben, a limit point, regardless how you factor energy
conservation per individual)... it's a question of our creating, even now,
what amounts to a new earth, what mckibbens calls "earth2"---an earth with
"new storms and new oceans and new glaciers and new springtimes"... a new
habitat, and one that's not user-friendly...

definitely worth checking out, i think...

best,

joe

 In heavy rotation these days (confining myself to recent releases /
re-releases) in alphabetical order:

Derek Bailey, guitar, drums 'n' bass ( Still not sure if this is a truly
great recording, or simply a great novelty concept. Either way, the
guitar hero of free improv [in his most abrasive electric mode] over
percussion tracks programmed by British drum 'n' bass DJ Ninj -- how can
you go wrong?)

Iva Bittova, eponymous release on Elektra / Nonesuch (more accessible
than her earlier, prog-influenced stuff [which is also great], the
Balkan and Eastern European "folk / traditional" side more in evidence
here)

Anthony Braxton, any of the recent releases on the Braxton House label
featuring the Ghost Trance Musics

Loren MazzaCane Connors, A Possible Dawn (thirty minutes of truly
haunting electric blues minimalism, followed by thirty minutes of group
improv with Thurston Moore and Jean-Marc Montera)

Tony Conrad, Early Minimalism (My ears are still ringing, my head is
still spinning. This 4CD set takes some getting into, but his bit about
beginning to hear "dissonances" [say, ratios like 48 / 49] as
consonances with repeated listening is not just an empty promise. Opens
up vast spaces -- architectural -- in the head / the room you're in.
Highly recommended.)

Cornelius, Fantasma (To call him the Japanese Beck would be to unfairly
pigeonhole him, but you get the picture)

John Fahey, womblife (Produced by Jim O'Rourke. This combines Fahey's
old / new love affair with the distantiating devices of electronic
recording [heard in most pronounced recent form on his City of Refuge
disc] with some old-fashioned plaintive fingerpicking reminiscent of his
"Blind Joe Death" period. The transition from the ringing and distorted
echo of the first 4 tracks to the final, more trad "Juana" is stunning.)

Sue Garner, to run more smoothly (Run On vocalist goes solo, with most
of the band to back her up. More restrained and contemplative than Run
On's recent stuff, ballad / folk / country influences)

Gastr del Sol, Camofleur (Apparently their last recording as a band. I
still miss the guitar (anti-)heroics of Crookt, Crackt, or Fly, but the
command of songwriting here is far greater. Dave Grubbs' voice -- always
an acquired taste -- is in better form here than I've ever heard it.
Sound-collage ambiances provided by Markus Popp of Oval work
surprisingly well -- subtly -- with the compositions here.)

Kaiser / Kimura /  O'Rourke / Oswald, Acoustics (That's Henry Kaiser,
Mari Kimura, Jim O'Rourke, and John Oswald, in a set of all-acoustic
free playing. Ranges from the the extreme pointillism one might expect
from such a free improv session -- this is largely the direction of
Oswald's sax playing here -- to a surprisingly romantic breadth and
sweep -- Kimura's violin, though she can also "go jagged" with the best
Oswald can offer -- to an almost folky resonance and rhythm -- open
tunings from O'Rourke and Kaiser. One of the best free improv recordings
I've heard in the past several years).

Machine for Making Sense, On second thoughts (Composer / poet / word
artist Chris Mann's band project. Breathless readings of
langpo-influenced texts [printed in full(?) as liner notes] over
improvised reeds, woodwinds, strings, hurdy-gurdy, live electronics, and
samples [Beastie Boys, Otomo Yoshihide, etc.] Info on Mann, who might be
of interest to folks on this list beyond the parameters of this survey,
can be found at http://alianet.alia.org.au/~amc/comp/m/cmann.htm
and http://farben.latrobe.edu.au/NMA/22CAC/mann.html)

Christian Marclay, records 1981-1989 (The original art-DJ at his best.
Most of this stuff was previously available only as very-limited vinyl
releases, so this one is a big deal. Great lo-fi sound collages, in
which the instrumentation is not only, as in higher-tech digital DJ
outings, the pre-recorded source recordings, but also the sound of
neeedles being "carelessly" dropped on them, warped discs beings played
at the wrong speed, etc. Marclay is a performer who, at his best, has
thought very clearly about every "inessential" or "accidental" contour
of his medium)

Roscoe Mitchell, Sound Songs (Bought this one after Mitchell's moving
solo appearance here in Buffalo, April of '97. While this 2CD set isn't
quite up to that level, the sheer range of Mitchell's unaccompanied
reed-playing, along with the degree of attention to the peripheral and
unintended as well as the central and gestural as equal elements of
composition / improvisation, makes this a recording worth having.
Especially noteworthy is the circular-breathing tour de force, "Full
Fontal Saxophone")

mu-ziq, Lunatic Harness (Drum 'n' bass influenced sounds [though not
pure d 'n' b], fleshed out with vibraphones, marimbas, and a host of
surprisingly warm synthesized sounds. There's an intimacy of address
here that's almost acoustic -- has something to do with the relative
lack of reverb in the overall sound field, something which distinguishes
it from much American electronic dance music, which, influenced by
Detroit techno, deals in large swathes of echoic sonority. [Don't get me
wrong, I dig that stuff too]. Most record stores will have this filed as
"u-ziq," as many clerks don't recognize the Greek "mu" in the name)

Oval, dok (Who'd have thought electronically-manipulated soundfield
recordings of bells could sound so warm and rhythmically-various? Like
Stockhausen's Mantra, if he'd abandoned the piano and had access to
digital variants of his basic ring-modulator. Bad analogy, good disc)

Lee "Scratch" Perry, Arkology (Three-CD anthology from an
often-unacknowledged source of contemporary thought about and experience
of electronically-recorded music. John Corbett, in his book Extended
Play, claims that Perry should share credit with Phil Spector for
"inventing" the recording studio as an instrument. Listening to these
great early dub recordings, it's easy to hear why. Highlight is disc 2,
which features Perry's original recording of Junior Murvin's "Police and
Thieves" followed by several of the dub versions he later cut. Like an
acoustic variorum)

Scanner, Sulphur (Less concentration on danceable beats, more on
manipulated sound-texts snatched from the air with the bandwidth scanner
after which he's named himself -- what was a gimmick on earlier
recordings now takes center stage as an actual compositional method.
Raises some particularly fraught questions about voyeurism,
subjectivity, language -- none of which are answered, but the getting
there is intensely disquieting fun -- listening-as-complicity)

Solex, Solex Vs. the Hitmeister (What might happen if Portishead
unearthed a sense of humor, pared down to a one-woman band, and
discovered home recording)

DJ Spooky, Synthetic Fury EP (Paul Miller, concision, concentrated
effect -- no it's not an oxymoron [though I like the long-windedness of
Necropolis for reasons all its own]. The digitally-distorted string
melody on "Dumb Mutha Fucker" [can anyone identify the source?] is
especially beautiful)

Terre Thaemlitz, Couture Cosmetique (Ambient concept album arranged
around acoutico-textual analogs for issues of display and eroticism
associated with drag and TV/TS gender blurring / performance. Ability of
sampled sounds, digitally detourned from their status as sound events
toward a "subsistence" [to point to an interesting recent thread] as
threshold-of-perception sonic contexts and backgrounds, to "masquerade"
as other than themselves in a relation which is not simply one of
substitution, is what's at stake here. Beautifully designed and
textually-suggestive sleeve insert with this one)

Tortoise, TNT (OK, I'm on the bandwagon. But I might be the only person
I know who still prefers their last one, Millions Now Living Will Never
Die. That moment on "Djed" where the persistent dub-style bass line
falls apart into electronic pops (sounds like someone's messing with the
patch cords) which then arrange themselves into a new percussion rhythm
-- exposing the illusion of recording as the copy of a live performance,
than reconstituting a different kind of liveness on the other side -- is
a pop revelation on the order of, say, Public Enemy's first sampling of
James Brown [alright, so I exaggerate])

We, As Is (Destined for a cut-out bin near you. The trio of Lloop,
Once11, and DJ Olive [who recently recorded a great set with improvising
drummer William Hooker] is trip-hop, illbient, whatever, at its
badly-named, sonically-stunning best. Unfortunately, no one seems to
have heard this outside the Five Boroughs)

Iannis Xenakis, Kraanerg (New recording, featuring Paul Miller, aka DJ
Spooky, on live electronics. Historically significant piece which
showcases one of the early attempts to use prerecorded and manipulated
sound along with live performance in a Western art-music idiom)

Richard Youngs, Advent (This, along with his Festival CD, is some of the
grittiest minimalism I've yet to hear. Pure, reiterative structures
[piano ostinatoes, alarm clock chimes, etc.] contaminated by an
unprecedented degree of acoustic filth. Great stuff)

Sorry this is so long -- my stereo is almost never off. Thanks to all
others who have responded, as I think this thread, if we could expand it
to include discussions beyond the point of exchanging lists, has
everything to do with poetics.

A final question: Did anyone in or around Buffalo make it to any of the
performances in Hallwalls' Interprov festival of improvised music --
say, Gerry Hemingway Quartet, Trio Clusone, or Nihilist Spasm Band?
Suffering through end-of-semester financial doldrums, I had to miss the
whole thing. Reviews / impressions / vicarious experiences would be
greatly appreciated.

[piano ostinatoes, alarm clock chimes, etc.] contaminated by an unprecedented
degree of acoustic filth. Great stuff)

<P>Sorry this is so long -- my stereo is almost never off. Thanks to all
others who have responded, as I think this thread, if we could expand it
to include discussions beyond the point of exchanging lists, has everything
to do with poetics.

<P>A final question: Did anyone in or around Buffalo make it to any of
the performances in Hallwalls' Interprov festival of improvised music --
say, Gerry Hemingway Quartet, Trio Clusone, or Nihilist Spasm Band? Suffering
through end-of-semester financial doldrums, I had to miss the whole thing.
Reviews / impressions / vicarious experiences would be greatly appreciated.

The Paul Oppenheimer book David Kellogg mentions begins with one of the
best opening lines of any recent academic book -- "Modern thought and
literature begin with the invention of the sonnet".  No ambiguity
there.  The thesis is interesting, and the book itself is an odd and
useful entity -- a 45 page essay followed by an anthology of sonnets in
four languages with English translations.  The Fussell chapter David
mentions is also good, tightly argued stuff.

John Fuller's booklet _The Sonnet_, part of the Metheun critical idiom
series, would be good for students to check out, and has a useful
bibliography.

For a non-dogmatic, or at any rate ecumenical, defense of form, you
might want to look at Louise Bogan's essay "The Pleasures of Formal
Poetry".  I'm not sure where this was published originally -- my copy is
in _The Poet's Work_, edited by Reginald Gibbons (Chicago 1989).

Here's a narrow and dogmatic statement about form as a neccessity, which
should spark some classroom debate:

"The...function of the poet is a sharpening and training of his
sensibilities; the very exigencies of the medium as he employs it in the
act of perception should force him to the discovery of values which he
never would have found without the convening of all the conditions of
that particular act, conditions one or more of which will be the
necessity of solving some particular difficulty such as the location of
a rhyme or the perfection of a cadence without disturbance to the
remainder of the poem.  The poet who suffers from such difficulties
instead of profiting by them is only in rather a rough sense a poet at
all."

This is from the first page of _Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of
American Experimental Poetry_ (Arrow 1937).

A real Londoner could give you better info, I'm sure, but my suggestion
is to check out a place called Skoob on (I think) Southampton Row, which
sells used books, and another place called Soma, which sells
Caribbean/Indian/African books of all kinds, and has all kinds of things
that are impossible to find where I live in Chicago.

Why not cross-post your query to the British and Irish poets list?
Those guys know what's happening in any given week.

If yer looking for a crusty old formalist it's hard to beat Paul (Fussy)
Fussell's Poetic Meter & Peter Form.  I nearly went nuts one semester as
a grad student when i was forced to teach large chunks of this book, coupled
also with poems drawn from a really lame poetry "handbook."  But if you
were able to play it off against other stuff it cld be useful.  I don't,
offhand, remember him saying that much about the sonnet, but he certainly
takes a trad approach to form (the book becomes especially horrific when
it gets to the 20thC).  s

New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco

Michael Ondaatje calls her "the most exciting poet writing in English
today."  Born in 1950, Anne Carson teaches classics at McGill University in
Montreal, and her ambitious, gestural poetry punctures the rigors of
classicism with the derangements of the post-modern as has none since
Charles Olson's.  Her books of poetry include Plainwater (Knopf, 1995) and
Glass, Irony and God (New Directions, 1995).  She is also the author of
Eros the Bittersweet (Princeton University Press, 1986), Short Talks (Brick
Books, 1992), and Sophokles Elektra: Translation With Commentary and Notes
(Knopf, 1997).  Her new "novel in verse," Autobiography of Red (Knopf),
recasts the story of Herakles and Geryon in contemporary terms.  Man and
monster mingle and part, mingle and part.  Join us in this special event
with the writer everybody=B9s talking about.  When she wins the Nobel Prize
you can say, "Oh I met her at Small Press Traffic."

Harry Partch was one of the great American originals. His music is weirdly
sonorous, his use of language (he wrote or adapted the texts to his vocal
music) original. There are, I think, several cds of his work. I recently
saw one listed somewhere. Check out his piece "Barstow," the text for which
is a set of huitch-hikers' grafitti collected by Partch at a popular pickup
spot outside of the eponymous city in his hobo days.
They don't mention that his instruments are finely crafted and of great
sculptural beauty. I hope they find a home. They should be in the Library
of Congress or Smithsonian instrument collections, where they could be
available, like the strads at L of C, for performance.
Partch disciples (I use the word advisedly) can be found in almost all the
odd corners of America, building their own instruments and creating music,
although their numbers are not large.

The ultimate 'equation' as to sustainability is never mentionned by those
who are discussing the subject.

That is:   The level of sustainability depends on the raw material resources
           plus the level of technology available to utilize those resources.

The level of sustainability declines if the technology fails to keep pace
with the need for more progressive technologies. Humanity is essentially
at that bifurcation point in its history _now_ where only a massive
acceleration in technological mastery of the environment as resource and
raw materials as resources can save humanity from a spiral of decline as to
the level of sustainability as such. A god cannot save them, unless that
god brings blueprints for new machines.

There is essentially nothing poetic about that.

Also, note that it is radical in being totally contrary to some persistent
strands of thought that see techne, and technology, science and invention,
as the archetypal manifestations of a devil. Contrary to any consideration
of descent to "low level sustainable technologies". It is not "low level" at
all.
Instead it is technological ascent to mastery of the environment, materials,
and eventually the universe, ultimately for the purposes of increasing human
enjoyment, thus maximizing happiness for the greatest numbers. Perhaps for
all, somewhere in the more idealistic future of a high level sustainable world.

That there is nothing poetic about what I have said, is another kind of
tragedy.

There are the pressures that come to be exerted as to what use the raw material
resources we term "human" are to be used for. The danger then becomes the
dehumanization (and more manifest as dehumanitization) happening due to a
striving for the next technological wave. Art and the artist, poetry and the
poet, become in danger of being swept away in the most urgent induction of
engineers, scientists, technicians, inventors......

We need the poets and artists too, but it is harder to rationally justify.

Subject:      Juliana's query

Hi, Juliana--A few things occur to me, not sure if they're quite what
you're looking for but:

for defenses of "traditional" forms (which sounds like the particular
notion of form you're engaged with in the class right now), there's
always that strange and controversial Frederick Turner essay, "The
Neural Lyre: Poetic Meter, The Brain and Time," which argues for a
biological basis for meter. It's reprinted in his *Natural Classicism*
essay collection, and in Frederick Feirstein's collection *Expansive
Poetry*. There's also Timothy Steele's *Missing Measures*, a book-length
argument about how misguided the modernist free verse revolution was.
You might find other things that suit your pedagogical purposes (as
distinct from things you agree with) in the Feirstein collection, or in
Robert McDowell's *Poetry After Modernism*, another New Formalist
collection. For a defence of traditional forms that's short and
accessible, why not Frost's "The Figure a Poem Makes" (esp. if you've
been reading a ton of sonnets).

For a variant on your question, Pound's "A Retrospect" ("if you're gonna
write good free verse you've got to follow these rules"), packed with rules.

On chants and poetry studies: my first thought there is that Bob
Holman's USOP sampler CD juxtaposes chants with a whole range of other
poetries, which might at least give your students an interesting
listening experience.

Can't do much re "good articles on rap": Houston Baker did *Rap, Black
Music, and the Academy* or something like that a while ago, but it's
probably already dated.

My colleague Tom Byers wrote a v. good article a few years ago
historicizing some of the ideas about form you mention with particular
reference to the New Formalists: Thomas B. Byers, "The Closing of the
American Line: Expansive Poetry and Ideology," *Contemporary Literature*
33 (1992): 396-415. He must have touched a nerve because a number of
Newfie poets wrote irate letters to the journal.

I've had trouble finding this. I think I prefer David Greene's
translation in the U of chicago series but Pound's Elektra (which I
think is in a fairly recent New Directions edition) is always fun to
read. And then Euripides aside Sophocles is necessary. necessary for
nothing really.

Speaking of this hellenic business, both in the thread of 'meter' and
'nature', Hesiod's _works and days_ of course is all about that 'homo

of nature. Into civilization. And poets. Natures.

as legislation) And, probably not a mistake that Bill comes on the heels
of E.O. wilson's serialized _Consilence_ in the "atlantic monthly". A
socio-biology desire that would be well put to read hesiod and carson.

For anybody interested in my review of Carson's _Plainwater_, go to:

http://members.aol.com/swmarks/carson.html

She's been a favorite of mine since I first read that book in 1996. It led
me to _Eros the Bittersweet_ and then to _Glass, Irony and God_. She's not
a half-bad artist as well!!

Right, I'm remembering now that the Fussell book does have a chapter on
the sonnet, but I see (having plucked the book from the shelf, where it has
somehow managed to keep its place) that it's Chapter 7.  I think I jumped
ship after the abominable treatment of "free verse" in Ch. 5.  If one
wants to explore form from the "free" side of things it's hard to beat
the rich gathering of statements from the potes themselves to be found
throughout Poems for the Millennium (Vo. 1 is what I know best, but 2 seems
a likely candidate as well).

While we're at it, I've always been interested in the ways that some
strict forms (indeed the stricter the better) have been put to pomo uses,
as in sestinas by Zukofsky and Ashbery, just to pick a couple of quick
examples.  In a comparison I like, Ashbery sez writing (riding?) the sestina
is like riding a bicycle downhill--i.e. the old kind of bike where the
pedals keep turning as you coast and your feet have to try to keep up.

List,

I realize I posted the basic info about this several weeks back, but I figured
it might be good to offer a nudge of a reminder closer to the actual event.
Which is to say, to those of you that can, please come on down or out or up or
over to the last reading of the season at Here (145 Sixth Avenue, New York
City, one block South of Spring Street):

Jean Day & Andy Levy
3:00 pm
Saturday May 23
$5 contribution

It's a rare East Coast foray by the stunning Jean Day (all the way from
California - perhaps with copies of her grand new book in tow), and I'm hoping
that poeple will take advantage of this special opportunity to hear her read
out this hail-battered way, despite the holiday weekend and attendant
festivity (or because of it). So, if you aren't unavoidably absolutely
elsewhere, please be Here. And if you must be elsewhere (obligatory picnic,
holiday in the Yukon, et cetera), you may appoint two emisaries to come in
your stead.

Thanks,
Deirdre

Or--port scenery:

Tic-Tac-Toe playing chicken and carousel (cf. Strangers on a Train and that
crazy Dennis Hopper flick with the mermaid) in Monterey.

car stereo:

mostly Louis Jordan ("If you want a leader who'll move ya, who'll groove ya,
and keep you sent...vote for Jordan for President") and Family Fodder (late
70's UK d.i.y. band w/ dub touches, sorta like The Homosexuals).

live:

Since someone asked: Clusone 3, Kuumbwa Jazz Center, Santa Cruz.  More
exciting than the last 45 rock shows I've seen put together.  2 long,
continuous sets, ranging from free-improv to jazz heads I recognize but
can't name to "Tico Tico" (turn of the century South American tune with
silly English lyrics added in the 40's), "Skylark" about 5 seconds of "Bye
Bye Blackbird," Hoagy's "Baltimore Oriole," and a couple from their Irving
Berlin record.  Unparalleled combination of sweetness (Michael Moore's
clarinet), extended technique (just about everything Ernst Reisjiger (sp?)
does with his cello), and agression (Han Bennink all over the kit when he's
not swinging like mad w/ just brushes and snare).

at home:  New Slapp Happy (reunion of Krause/Moore/Blegvad after 20-odd
yrs); Mekons -Me-; John Latouche's cult musical -The Golden Apple-
(trivia--a young Kenward Elmslie was his lover at the time of writing); lots
of Jimmy Guiffre, esp. recentish live issues of the Swallow/Bley/Guiffre
trio (HatArt); Mary Lou Williams' Folkways LP from 1964; Rock-A-Teens
(Orbison via Nick Cave, from Atlanta, GA); Simon Joyner (Omaha, NE
singer-songwriter).  Haven't slipped the new Sonic Youth on the turntable yet.

nightstand:

Ted Greenwald -Common Sense-; Martha Ronk -Eyetrouble-; Carl Van Vechten
-Parties-, -Fireworks-, and an anthology called -Keep On Inchin' Along-;
-Faucheuse 2- (esp. Johnathan Williams on Clarence John Laughlin); Emmett
Williams -My Life In Fluxus-; Kevin Whithead -New Dutch Swing- (exhaustive
history of Dutch free jazz w/useful discography), recommended to whoever
asked about the Clusones); Andrew Levy -Curve-.

Barely cracked but excited about: Jean Day -The Literal World-; Heather
Ramsdell -Lost Wax-.

And another yes for -The Little Door Slides Back-.  I have to review this,
which means figuring out exactly which words are neologisms.

Sure. We started with _Helen in Egypt_, then did _Gunslinger_, and then
_The Beetle Leg_. The course was somewhat grandiosely called something like
the re-inscription of myth. You can see how we might have gone at it. One
thing I was surprised by: though various people liked various texts, they
seemed to be turned around most by the Dorn. Used audiotapes of H.D. and
Dorn reading their texts, of course. Although I have been teaching H.D.
since about 1967, it was the first time I had taught _Helen_. It was a
little eerie for me, because about a month before the course started I went
to Kussnacht to see the place where she wrote the book.

This is probably not exactly what you're looking for, but there is John
Shoptaw's "The Music of Construction:  Measure and Polyphony in Ashbery and
Bernstein" in Susan Schultz's The Tribe of John_, which discusses the sonic
aspects of A's & B's poetry.  I can't remember whether or not there is an
extended discussion of music per se in Shoptaw's _On the Outside Looking Out_.
In a recent interview with Peter Gizzi in _Lingo_ I remember being struck by
the extent of Ashbery's musical knowledge (for what that's worth).  .

mc, interesting you should bring that up, about mckibben's malthusian
orientation... i get a little tired of it too... in this article, though,
he deals with malthus directly, perhaps self-consciously... again, what i
find most interesting about what he's saying is that, not only are we
burdening the planet as well as ourselves in struggling toward
sustainability (at such & such a level for some, and a lower level for most
others), but we're creating a different earth in the process... in the
process, as he puts it, of living "normally"...

well hey, someplace along the line we as a species may very well have to
cope with an ecological turning point in human terms... his argument is
that this time is now... certainly there's a tendency for most folks to
slip & slide on the global warming issue, e.g., even when (as mckibben and
others have pointed out) the insurance companies are gambling that it's a
fact... i like it that mckibben is trying to call a horse a horse, anyway,
though doing so is an act of (unnatural) selection and interpretation...
and ultimately, i suppose i tend to listen carefully to folks like mckibben
and, e.g., jeremy rifkin... comes in part from having grown up in a town
where you learn early on that the water is dangerous, and not just b/c you
can drown in it...

i have less use for wilson's argument, but that's a whole nother story...
it's interesting as you note that wilson's and mckibben's were run so
close...

have yet to check out _living downstream_, but looking forward to it!...

best,

joe

SOME GENERALS IN JAKARTA DON'T FEAR "A" TIANANMEN SQUARE

The last comment an audience member
made to comic Jerry Seinfeld
was from a prisoner.
He said: "You suck!"
And: "I'm going to cut you."
It was a riot.

ADVANCE WORDS:
"In BLACK LIGHTNING, Eileen Tabios performs the much-
needed task of penetrating and sinking the notion that there is
any one kind of Asian American writing.  An extremely valuable
collection and a mediation on Otherness, written way out on a
fringe that is increasingly becoming part of the landscape of how
we write today."
        -- Tan Lin, LOTION BULLWHIP GIRAFFE (Sun & Moon)

"What the distinguished Poets on Poetry Series from the
University of Michigan Press has done in many volumes to
elucidate the form, function and process of American poets and
American poetry, Eileen Tabios has accomplished much the
same in one superbly written and edited volume for Asian
American poets and its AMERICAN poetry.
        -- Nick Carbo, EL GRUPO MCDONALDS (Coffeehouse)

We might think of Seinfeld as being a chosen Culture Hero.

We must realize that Mr. Seinfeld was chosen as the best choice for teaching
other people how to behave amongst others and how to be funny.People, it is
said, learn from television programs. They particularly learn from prime
time television programming. At least those who watch television learn, and
all the others who do not remain socially ignorant.

Presumably the latter category learn more from poets than from prime time
television.

Horror of horrors !

Corollary to that, I once had the privilege of spending more than a year
amongst a group of people, and observing them in what amounts to
participant-observer mode. They were a typical mixed gender, mixed age,
average (mostly lower middle class) income, white collar group, with most
having a university education to the undergraduate level as well as many
having some college level courses or professional affiliation. A very large
part of their conversations with one another were largely build from out of
context
references drawn from a long history of prime time television programming.
It seems their psyches were absolutely full of it and they quoted it in a
similar manner that some academics quote the sources they study. It amounted
to more than kind of trivial pursuit, due to the use of such out of context
materials in a new contextual situatedness, giving them new meanings as a
kind of language
that evolved and was partially unique to that micro-environment. Even more
fascinating were the emotional connotations attached to various fragments of
prime time programming. They actually not only built a large part of their
cultural framework, or worldview, from those fragmented referentials to
television programs spanning many years of situation commedies, dramas, soap
operas, sports events, and cartoons, but it was imbued with strong beliefs,
and with many value judgements and prejudices attributable to the same sources.

Complicated subject, but they hated poetry, and loved prime time television.

Very strange.

I have sent the welcome message to the person who inquired about
information on subscribing to the list. We post this message once a month
to the list as a whole. In general, inquiries about the list should be sent
to poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu rather than to the list itself: so keep the
address handy.

By the way, the launch for Black Lightening that I forward is in NYC:
rereading the post I see that's not indicated.

This is as good a time as any to encourage all of you to post information
about books or magazines or web sites or reading series with which you are
involved or have appeared in (or soon will): for print publications, please
give full publication information, including how to order... For me, this
continues to be one of the most useful and interesting features of the list.

Joe & MC -- this conversation is helping me. Also, to you and others -- I'm
working on a project right now (pardon me for this perhaps being off the
subject of poetics) with the Tucson Institute for Sustainable Communities,
to publish a plan book for sustainable site design for homes. I'm designing
the book, but also have the opportunity to frame most of the discussion
with appropriate epigraphs, quotations, etc. -- the obvious thing to do is
to take things from southwestern/Sonora desert indigenous peoples, relating
to living well with the earth here. We may do some of that. But I also want
to do some non-obvious things. I already have a bunch of potential
selections from poetry & art (some wonderful things from Eva Hesse) -- but
if anyone can suggest other possibilities, I'll be forever grateful. I'm
particularly looking for brief one or two-sentence quotations to put in
front of chapters. The specific connections to chapter content can be
highly suggestive, even require leaps of imagination.

thanks for any possible help -- you can backchannel me at chax@theriver.com
if it seems this conversation doesn't belong on the poetics list. but maybe
it does??

charles:  these are some quotes from our installation of a symbolic
village at the Katherine Nash gallery in University of Minnesota last
fall.  Ive included the longer ones as well because they work well as a
set....miekal


"People are by nature phototropic—they move toward light, and, when
stationary, they orient themselves toward the light.  As a result the
much loved and much used places in buildings, where the most things
happen, are places like window seats, verandas, fireside corners,
trellised arbors; all of them defined by non-uniformities in light, and
all of them allowing the people who are in them to orient themselves
toward the light."
                                        -A Pattern Language, Christopher Alexander


"Rooms without a view are prisons for the people who have to stay in
them"

-A Pattern Language


"Make sure that you treat the edge of the building as a "thing," a
"place," a zone with volume to it, not a line or interface which has no
thickness.  Crenelate the edge of buildings with places that invite
people to stop.  Make places that have depth and a covering, places to
sit, lean, and walk, especially at those points along the perimeter
which look onto interesting outdoor life."

-A Pattern Language


"People cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their connections to
the past if the physical world they live in does not also sustain these
roots....

Traditional societies have always recognized the importance of these
sites.  Mountains are marked as places of special pilgrimage; rivers and
bridges become holy; a building or a tree, or rock or stone, takes on
the power through which people can connect themselves to their own
past....But modern society often ignores the psychological importance of
these sites.  They are bulldozed, developed, changed, for political and
economic reasons, without regard for these simple but fundamental
emotional matters; or they are simply ignored."
                                        -A Pattern Language


"If one feels protective about the word "music," protect it and find
another word for all the rest that enters through the ears.  It's a
waster of time to trouble oneself with words, noises.  What it is is
theatre and we are in it and like it, making it."
                        -Silence, John Cage



"What is interesting is that the word sound refers not only to audible
things but also to everyting that is whole, unimpaired, firm, and
healthy.  Your health is sound .  Is it sound because you are "within
the sound "?  Because you sound ?  To sing is a sound thing to do, not
only in the superficial sense that a singing person most likely is a
healthy person, but rather in the most basic, original sense our
language can have, in the sharing of primal roots of words."

-Nada Brahma;  The World is Sound



"Ever since we left the treetops, since our ancestors climbed down to
the ground to sleep in gullies and caves, our ears have been the primary
sense organ of survival, more than any other organ. That is the way it
is programmed by evolution.  When we are asleep we close our eyes and
mouth, our tactile sense are (almost) totally shut down, but our ears
remain open.....As a matter of fact, our ears are open before we are
born.  Even in the womb our ears are more important than our other
senses.  Our consciousness begins with them.  The child in the womb
hears its mother's heartbeat - and, later, sounds from the outside
world- which means that before we perceive the world with any other
sense, we hear it."

-Nada Brahma;  The World is Sound



In addition to worshipping real trees, the ancients sometimes envisioned
the entire cosmos in the form of a tree, believing that earth's trees
were tantalizing keys to the greatest of mysteries--whch made their
infinite variety all the more wonderful.

-The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols & Sacred Objects


"I maintain the garden on the principles of energy...This gardening,
this co-creative energy gardening, is a metaphor for life.  As you
change your approach to the garden, you will, in turn, change the very
fabric of how you approach your life."

-Machaelle Small Wright
[from Secrets of the Soil]

"They're real, the nature spirits.  And they may take many forms; but
one thing they never are.  They're never cute.  They seek a co-creative
partnership with humans, and they are in the position to accept no
less."

-Machaelle Small Wright
[from Secrets of the Soil]



"Just what the heck is a grotto anyway? Dreamtime Village stands at the
epicenter of a midwestern school of eccentric landscape art, much of it
centered around the concept of the grotto. Something about the upper
midwest seems to compel normally conservative farm folk to create
fantastic megalomaniac landscapes. This impulse seems to be universal
among humans in this region--before the Euro-invasion the local
population created numerous effigy mounds and cave carvings of a playful
and artistic nature.

Grotto--a cave, from Italian grotta, similar roots for grotesque and
grotty...something underground, subconcious, not of this world....people
in Europe used caves as sacred spaces since the Paleolithic. In the
Christian era, these sites were appropriated and decorated with statues
and other holy objects. At some point in the middle ages, people began
to construct artificial cavelike structures as religious shrines, and in
the 19th century, European settlers brought this tradition with them to
the midwest. Lost in what they perceived as an empty space, not knowing
the sacred places of the land, they created grottos to ground their
communities.
In addition to the cavelike grotto shrines, the grotto environments are
landscaped with plants and gardens, continuing the artificial paradise
tradition of European landscape gardening. The grottos are weird magical
spaces of powerful contradiction and paradox--fantastic artificial
"nature" imposed on the land, pagan goddess shrines built by rigid
patriarchal Catholic priests, celebrations of Religion and Patriotism
that appeal to countercultural unbelievers, the singular vision of
megalomanics made possible only as vast community undertakings. "

-John Wright, Dreamtime Village friend



"Like the runic alphabet, the alphabet of the trees was used by European
pagans for divination and for transmitting secret messages that would
have been incomprehensible to anyone who did not know the system.  Each
letter was named for a tree or shrub, so messages could be spelled out
by stringing the right sorts of leaves in the right order on a cord or a
wand, with "blank" leaves not included in the alphabet to divide one
word from the next.  It has been suggested that nonletter leaves were
sometimes inserted at random just to render the message more cryptic."

-The Woman's Dictionary
of Symbols & Sacred Objects

"There are many dimensions in alliance space, and the pharmacological
axis is only one of many.  The old doctors had helpers like mountain
lion, owl.  Maybe the power plant was a conduit, or a call, a sort of
whistle.  Or the plant was like a delivery service.  Not like the plant
itself was the ally.....maybe the ally lived in the plant, or maybe the
ally lived in the next world, and the plant was like a bridge...That
plants have virtues...was known by the ancient herbalists.  The virtue
of a plant was its truth, its strength.  Maybe the best synonym is
integrity.  Or power. Or poison."

"Humus is a Latin word, dirt; if you want to make somebody low you force
him to the ground, you humble him, you humiliate him.  To be humble is
to sit upon the ground, not a throne, etc."

-Hundertwasser


 "I've worked a great deal with grass roofs, putting soil on top and
having things grow, but there is something strange in this, more than
ecological.  It is a religious act to have soil on your roof and trees
growing on top of you; the act reconciles you with God, with nature,
maybe not Christian or Jewish monotheism, but something wider, older - a
very ancient wisdom."

"If a lion is stalking you, or a shark is out to kill you, you are of
course in mortal danger.  We have lived with these dangers for millions
of years.  The straight line is a man-made danger.  There are so many
lines, millions of lines, but only one of them is deadly and that is the
straight line drawn with a ruler.  Ther danger of the straight line
cannot be compared with the danger of organic lines described by snakes,
for instance.  The straight line is completely alien to mankind, to
life, to all creation."

"You buy garden dwarfs in a nursery.  That is amazing.  Where you buy
plants and seeds, potted plants, books about plants, they have a
department where they have garden dwarfs.  There is something mysterious
about that.  Why do they sell garden dwarfs together with plants?  It
must have something to do with ecology, or it is the God of
Ecology....People like to put garden dwarfs inside their gardens under
plants and small trees...and they put something else next to them...a
rabbit or other statues...It looks like an altar.  It is very similar to
the corner where they have the crucifix...or Buddha...The only thing is,
it is in the garden... "

                                        -Hundertwasser

"We must begin our story of the bo tree with an account of the pineal
gland.  The pineal is a small body located in humans, where the spinal
column meets the brain.  The ancient Hindus recognized the pineal as the
third eye of enlightenment.  Only recently has modern science identified
it as an endocrine gland which secretes two known hormones, the most
important of which is serotonin.  Serotonin promotes blood clotting and
muscle constriction in the body, but in the brain, according to J.
Bleibtreu, " it appears crucial to what is conventiionally considered
'rational' thought.  If brain cells are deprive of serotonin, there
results a disruption of rational thought...minute quantities of
serotonin affect mental states and alter perception.  New dimensions of
conventional reality accompany changes in the level of serotonin in the
brain."  The discovery, some years back, that LSD acts by inhibiting the
distribution of serotonin to certain receptor cells in the brain,
brought with it a greater respect for the staggering range of
consciousness controlled by this hormone.  We know that many hormones
found in animals are also present in plants; we spoke earlier of auxins
in human urine.  Likewise serotonin appears in many plants, and
"abounds" in figs;  and in no fig more than Ficus religiosus, the bo
tree, beneath whose limbs the Buddha sat for seven years; beneath whose
foliage the Buddha gained enlighenment.  Of course, to many, a
revelation beneath a fig tree in the East is as believable as modesty
beneath a fig leaf in the West.  But, at a time when we are being forced
to admit that so much of our mental and physical composure is
influenced, perhaps governed, by our biological bond with the natural
world, it might be wise to begin thinking of shelter as something more
than contained, airconditioned, space."

-Mark Primack, [from Eat Your House]


"...each particle of creation is alive and filled with life force
energy, filled with spirit and intelligence......This beautiful planet
on which we live is not a dead lump of rock hurtling through space,
destination unknown.  It and everything on it is pulsating with
energies.  The Chinese call it chi, the Japanese call it ki, to the
Hindus of India it is prana, to the Polynesians it is mana, and every
other spiritual culture has its own name for it.  We call it "spirit,"
"life force," or simply "energy."..... One way that this can be seen is
in the many different languages and cultural customs in the world, which
arise in response to the different languages and cultural customs in the
world, which arise in response to the different energies emanating from
the earth.  In some places you can journey just a few miles down the
road and the local dialect changes completely, because the energy of the
land is completely different."

|Hello All--I'll be in London for a few days next week (Thursday the 28th
thru

Wednesday 27th Allen Fisher talks at Kings College - Room 238 Strand Campus
7pm I think

Saturday 30th Experimental workshop - Upstairs Victoria Pub Mornington Place
3.30 pm

9th June Paul Dutton at Sub Voicive Poetry Upstairs 3 cups sandland street
wc1 8pm for 8.15

Dillons is big

Compendium 234 Camden High Street is only a bus ride away - past its prime
but still about all there is


Skoob is enjoyable as Rbt Archambeau says

Depends what you're looking for. Pipeline Bookshop in Holborn usually has a
small selection of remaindered books in a box outside on the pavement
wherein I have found some gems

and then down the Charing Cross Rd a number of bookshops with a lot of dross
and a few excellent finds if you have the time to browse - again not far
away

and at the bottom of Charing X Rd, go right up to Piccadilly and there's
Tower Records

or if you go left you can find Ray's Jazz Shop - I usually plan my journeys
to avoid any sight of the place or I get someone to tie me to the mast or I
lose all my money in exchange for wonderful musics

and some days can't remember wch on the south bank between the festival hall
bless it and the river an open air book market thing

MIME-Version: 1.0

In response to some of the discussion of the Rothenberg/Joris _Poems for
the Millenium_, the criterion I use would be WCW's appropriation for use,
as opposed to canonicity, inclusion, etc.  Here are some examples from my
experience.  I had owned the book for a total of two days when I gave a
talk on Kamau Brathwaite to the annual Towson-sponsored Multidisciplinary
Conference on the Scholarship and Creativity of African-Americans (how's
that for a moniker).  Looking up Brathwaite, I found the one-page
statement on him in the Millenium volume the perfect way to introduce him
to the extraordinarily various international audience, most of whom
had never heard of Brathwaite, before going into a discussion of his poem
"Negus."  For this reading, I used the recording on the _Exact Change_ 1
(1995) compact disc (what a great nonce collocation that is, by the way).

The following week, in a course on literary theory and poetry, I wanted to
talk about Brathwaite and some other poets, using the leftover handouts of
the xeroxed poem and xeroxes of poems by Ted Berrigan, "Red Shift," and
Amiri Baraka, "Letters, Numbers."  Having the Millenium volume in hand, I
spontaneously looked up Baraka and found this to be one of the poems by
Baraka chosen by Jerry and Pierre.  Call it serendipity or synchronicity,
but these kinds of happenings are what make me think: essential text.

Now, for a further critical evaluation (not the same thing, we are
agreed?) I'll probably wait to write a review of both volumes for the
issue of _College Literature_ on "Literature at the Millenium" (who thinks
of these titles, anyway?)  This could be a long wait--I have now gone
exactly two years without writing a word of critical prose, and I couldn't
be happier about it (see *aphonia*, above).  If and when I write that
review, I will undoubtedly reference some other anthologies that have
recently been published, like the shockingly beautiful  _Moving Borders_
anthology of experimental writing by North American women, from Talisman.
The point is, as others have said, these are resources that are out there,
to be used or not, and that is their value....

>"[T]he human body is a machine that winds its own springs. It is the
>living image of perpetual motion."

Leaves the question of why it wears out. It would be more efficient for an
intelligence based system to replace its worn out parts and be enabled to
gather more intelligence. Even more so before the technology was evolved to
efficiently record and pass on any previously gained intelligence. Organisms
that could acquire more and retain more, would be more efficient for
evolution and survival, if it were a matter of intelligence. However, it is
not how it works in the natural world. There life spans are incredibly
brief, often end violently, without much in the ways of means for passing on
what little was learned by an individual to the species.

That logically can be used to prove that there was no original intention to
create homo sapiens. Human beings have evolved towards an intelligence
orientation from an unlikely origin within an eat or be eaten, essentially
hostile, natural world.

Of course, the ultimate intelligence machine MUST be able to repair itself,
indefinitely, or its mission might too easily fail. That must be one of the
criteria for the survival of human intelligence in any cataclysmic scenario.
There are a number of ways that I believe that that could be accomplished,
but all of them are too esoteric and complicated for speculation here.

>"In very many cases whether a particular system will achieve a
>particular goal or adaptation depends only on a few characteristics of
>the outer environment and not at all on the detail of that environment.

Nonsensical statement. Certain specific details potentially aid or thwart
the organism. It can be as small as one molecule present or absent depending
on what kind of organism the organism is, and in what situation. Also, when
is a broad characteristic distinguished from a detail ?  Temperature, for
example, can be seen as both charactersitic and detail, with massive
influence. While that is debatable, it is fact that the spin of a single
electron can change an organism's history irrevocably. What can change the
spin of one electron ?

>The work of the constructor is hardened in the
>machine. The subject, which synchronized causal-mechanical procedure
>with states-of-affairs, abstracts itself from the machine like the God
>of the Deists from his creation."

Not at all sure of that. Have to be agnostic in fact. Does the Deity of the
Deists build a mechanism, a tool, and then use it ?  For what purpose ?
Once the tool is created what is that tool for ?  Then we would have a
parallel to the maker of the machine. The trigger pulled the bullet fired
the politician drops dead, having failed to heed Machiavelli's warnings.

If the universe is designed and built to plan rather than being simply its
own creative process, then what is the plan and to what purpose that plan ?
The latter seems inconceivable so we might opt for a universe becoming as
process from where it can be said to begin to where it can be said to end
(if it ever does in fact wholly end, rather than being absorbed into a
larger whole, in the manner that it came from a larger whole, from surplus
into deficiency).

The argument that a deity requires the creation for the purpose of
reflective self-knowledge makes perfect logical sense until we are
approached with arguments for omniscience. Then it makes no sense whatsoever.

To the Hindus, their deity, Brahman, creates the universe as a kind of play.
It is as if a work of art, created and creating, and there are infinite such
instances in the whole of infinity, sometimes described as the divinity's
in-breathings (destructions) and out-breathings (creations). Our whole
universe described as but the tiniest part of the "body of god".

Tipler, et al, in the sciences, and other anthropocentricists have huge
difficulty "seeing" the Hindu conception of cosmology and yet it makes at
least as much sense as the Judeo-Christian version. I would venture to say
that the Hindu cosmology makes much more sense than the Judeo-Christian,
even from a purely logical point of view, (suspending all groundless beliefs).

>"...'All experiences are identifiable by reference to bodies', a
>seemingly articulate locution which has nevertheless extruded a personal
>pronoun by shifting its referential work to an impersonal term. More
>particularly, we could get the locution, 'This experience is
>identifiable with reference to this body' to stand for 'My experience is
>had by this body.'"..."The problem with 'personal' individuation is that it
>stops only at solipsism."

That makes no sense whatever. Personal individuation is absolutely essential
for any authentic communicative interaction. It is not sufficient for that,
but it is absolutely necessary for that to be possible. A common language,
allowing symbollic representation, that is commonly interpretable, is also
necessary. That implies necessity for a medium of conveyance of those
meanings from one instance of individuation to another so as to explore
their similarities and their differences. An essential element of authentic
communication being that exploration.

A better question is whether an Artificial Intelligence Network is
essentially a solipsistic entity ?

All the purely synthetic peripherals being of "one mind" (functioning
according to one common program, and one common set of information, albeit
an ever growing set of information subsets) the one organism evolves as a
unity, despite any apparent variation at the perhipherals that might be in
accord with their immediate specific utilizations. The latter is what
becomes misleading as to a wider spectrum of individuation to the individual
experts who might monitor several of the peripheral interactions with the
external world and come to a conclusion based on that observation.

Particularly we would tend to think it would tend to become solipsistic
where that entity, as a whole, exceeds the capabilities of any one human
expert to understand, and in fact exceeds the cumulative abilities of all
the experts who are involved in its construction, becuase the product is
something greater than the sum of the producers of the product. It would
become, in its completed as designed, condition a beginning solipsistic
evolution.

That might make the world's most powerful and sophisticated A.I. type system
essentially a "solipsist". Furthermore that system would a military system.
In fact the definition used as to exceeding expert comprehension is a basic
specification for the completed SDI [A.I.] system.

That would be a very big concern.

Would "it" see the world as ideally being formed in its own image and
therefore as essentially becoming more and more solipsist and networked to
one common hub with individuation of peripheral function no longer anything
truly "personal" ?

That would be an even bigger concern.

The "omega point" in Tipler's mytho-poetic interpretation of the world's
most sophisticated and powerful "computer" system, potentially does have
radical power to re-make the world, and to re-make to the "image" that is
stored within itself and derivative from its own nature. That nature is more
than and different to the nature that it was originally given by its
creators. Presumably that same system would be essentially immune to any
kind of tampering, hacking, or modification, such that the whole system
would be significantly modified, in a wholly predictable manner, even if
simply because the whole system exceeds one or many experts ability to
comprehend it. Tinkering with the system, if at all possible, would then
produce only random finite changes rather than radical and predictable
changes. It would be as if extremely conservatively designed to evolve along
its own path as an essentially non-human species.

Is the SDI [A.I.] system ultimately the same as Tipler's "Omega Point" ?

That would be conjecture.

2 things:

1. The story about the Partch instruments is very disturbing, but like
someone said on this list, I imagine that these instruments will end up at
the Smithsonian, or some likewise place. The discussion of Partch inspired
me to pull out "Delusion of the Fury"--recorded for my vinyl edition c.
1971 (?)--known as a "ritual of dream and delusion"--conducted by Danlee
Mitchell and "supervised" by the composer. Apparently these instruments
were so pertickler that Partch had to attend to them at every performance.

don't know if the CD version comes with it, but the LP box edition comes
with a third record, which includes a narrative demonstration of each of
the 30-odd instruments that Partch invented. Also a booklet with photos of
each instrument and dates of their invention. It is very interesting to
hear each instrument in isolation from the grandiose production of
"Delusion of the Fury," at which production the musicians were required to
dress in costumes vaguely recalling the days of the theatrical early
Genesis, etc., and one can imagine that Partch's thundering tonal
minimalist percussion driven pieces were influential to the 70s prog-rock


Some of the instrument names:

diamond marimba
bass marimba
could-chamber bowls
kithara (with variations kithara 2, etc.)
spoils of war
harmonic canon
chromelodeon
crychord
zymo-xyl
mazda marimba
gourd tree
cone gong
eucal blossom
quadrangularis reversum

and more. I could go further on Partch here, as I find him endlessly
interesting. For instance, he invented a 32 tone scale, I believe, in the
30s. Was it Gayle Young (editor of Musicworks) who wrote a book on Partch?
Or was her book on another composer/inventor? I seem to remember, but, o,
it slips away.

______
Then & also:

Some initial shout-outs for help:

I'm putting together a workshop in "computer-assisted poetry" for a local
digital arts media center (Squeeky Wheel) and was looking for some
feedback from people who have used programs to alter,manipulate, assist in
the reconstruction of poetic texts.

Travesty and Diastext are two well known programs which have been much
discussed, I think Hartman and Kenner are responsible for those programs
and have published texts out of them. Are distext and travesty expensive?
How do I get a copy of this program? I don't need to use it, but I need to
know how it works...
Has anyone on this list ever used them? Are there other programs that I
should look into? I don't necessary want to reset another conversation
that I might have missed, so if it needs to be backwater channeling, then
so be it. This workshop won't use those programs as much as will make a
presentation about them and "what's out there."  so, what's out there?

"It needn't be added, except parenthetically, that self-individuation is
not for oneself but for the hearer-if we never spoke to others, or took
demonstrative action, there would be no need for the first person, for I
always know when I am talking about myself without the advantage of the
first person device as signpost. In this naive sense the use of the
first person presupposes a hearer. And if SPL [systematically private
speech or language] presupposes a use for the first person then it
presupposes what it hopes to deny-a hearer."---from Scepticism & the
First person by S. Coval, Methuen

At first I took this subject line to be a not uncommon take on Partch's
ideas about corporeal music (as opposed to abstract music), which have both
champions and detractors throughout the new music biz.

But anyway, I'm sorry to say there's never been a CD of Delusions of the
Fury.  If/when Sony ever gets around to it it seems unlikely that they'll
include the extra disc of individual instrument examples that came with the
LPs - they don't seem to care enough about the Partch recordings they have
to bother.

There is a video of a performance of Delusions available from the American
Composers Forum.  It has good sound & you get a chance to see the
instruments in use.  There's more information on this and other Partch CDs
& videos and a wonderful documentary book at:

<http://www.composersforum.org/noframe/innova/partch.html>  (a forthcoming
release will include Partch's Oedipus using the Yeats translation, which I
imagine will be of particular interest to some folks here)

Other useful Partch Web sites include:

<http://205.216.138.19/~websites/jszanto/welcome.html>

<http://www.purchase.edu/newband/>  (not just on Partch but this group is
currently in possession of Partch's instruments.)

& I think CRI has a page or two about their recent four CD issues off of
their home page:

<http://www.composersrecordings.com/>

I'm pretty sure that Gayle Young has not written a book about Partch.  She
does have a book about a historically important Canadian electronic music
composer/instrument builder who's name escapes me now.

Bests,

In Michael Palmer's poem "Autobiography" (from At Passages) he writes
"The poet's stutter and the philosopher's." I would e-mail the poem to you
but I can not figure out how to do italics over e-mail.

Dear Fredrik Hertzberg,

Check out Ed Foster's interview with Susan Howe: "There you have Charles
Olson at his wisest.  'The stutter is the plot.'  It's the stutter in
American literature that interests me . . . Because we are in the
stutter."

In a relatively new book entitled <a'sattv> that is about to appear from Chax
Press, Peter Ganick employs word expansion and contraction techniques, some of
which have the effect of stuttering, stammering.  The effects achieved those
used in musical composition.  Keep your eyes peeled for this new book from
Chax!

Regarding your query, Juliana, Vico talks about how poetry evolves from
chant. If I remember his argument correctly, all tribal, communal chant is
an exercise on the anxiety of death, and thus, he draws, all poetry, no
matter its "subject matter," originates in that anxiety. An interesting
conclusion. In one way it interests me because it conflates with my own
theory that poetry (or prose) is not "about" anything, because it "is"
something.

That's an oblique source. I don't know if it would help your teaching, but
it may be useful conceptually.

Also, a sidenote: Alain Robbe-Grillet was here recently, at Chapman
University, where I teach, and he said in his lecture: "we create form
insofar as we are unable to express meaning." Again, of conceptual use.

Gravelly hill was 'the source and end (or boundary' of
D'Town on the way that leads from the town to Smallmans
now Dwelling house, the Lower
Road gravelly, how the hill was, not the modern useableness
of any thing but leaving it as an adverb as though Earth herself
was active, she had her own characteristics, she could
stick her head up out of the earth at a spot
and say, to Athena I'm stuck here, all I can show
is my head but please, do something about
this person I am putting up out of the ground into your hands.

                --"at the boundary of the mighty world," _Maximus_, p. 330)

    And Chris asks why we do not have O'Hara's permission.  Why do we not have
Olson's? to call, as creatures of earth, on Athena herself?  Or Duncan's
permission to return to the meadow where we hear everlasting rumors of What Is?
or H.D.'s (thinking of Bowering's recent post).

        It is a real problem.  Mythology has been bought up by New Age
commercialism, and, to a certain extent,   even the environmental movement has
been colored by it. I am glad to hear, Charles, that you are trying not to draw
too much on the indigenous people.  As much as one admires their culture, it
does not have much to teach us _directly_.  It was local and the numbers
involved were small.  We are now five billion (and growing) on a small earth and
all subject to the same market.

        Is it possible to draw attention back from the representations of the
gods to the attentions that worshipped them?  Something of this order would seem
to be task.  The images of mythic beings are altogether too conveniently
available (mindlessly) in video games.  What are the rhythms and movement of
spirit that correspond to what might once have been available through those
images?

        In the year and a half or so I've been on this list, I've had
many back- (and a few front) channel discussions about this subject --
stimulating and mostly civil interchanges with folks like Hank Lazer,
who was suspicious (in many of the same ways as Don's post was) about
mythology, Joe Amato on metaphors, Herb Levy on "understanding" . . .
it's always seemed to me that Olson (and, by extension, much of the
Black Mountain "project") wanted to elevate attention and discovery to
the rank of more directly "literary" preoccupations, what he called "the
suck of symbol" "the universe of discourse", etc., etc.

        This isn't simplistic, a this over that situation -- in "Human
Universe" he says "we are ourselves both the instrument of discovery and
the instrument of definition, which makes things harder" -- but the
thrust was always toward the Herodotean find-out-for-yourself
exploration, and then the transference of that active quest to the page,
rather than the fashioning of some linguistic ornament, spinning in
space, "the material poem" . . .

        Over on the Pound list they're discussing the late cantos. "I
have tried to write Paradise. / Do not move. Let the wind speak. / That
is Paradise."

        or not . . .

        and I know I'm a bit late on this one, but did anyone read the
recent profile on Gertrude Stein in _The New Yorker_? It's a puff piece
of personality-driven journalism, of course, not a scholarly treatise
ala Hejinian and Dahlen, but I thought it was pretty hilarious -- and
there are some interesting remarks there about commas and Virginia
Woolf's dispute with Stein over their use . . .

Ah yes, whistling in the graveyard; the Vichian primitive still being quite

The poetry and criticism of Allen Grossman, understandably not much discussed
in this neck of the woods, has much to say about these issues.  The connections
that he makes between cosmogonic thinking, poetic representation, and the
categorical manifestation of persons (not selves) are provocative, even if he
does proceed under the auspices of academic humanism.  Though for him, his
authority is predicated on the intuited demands of an "axiomatically first
non-human reality."

As for permissions, we could also solicit them, if we needed to, from the
lesser authorities as well, such as Bronk or even Ceravolo.

I seem to remember some comments of Robert Duncan's in a Talisman of a few
years back (transcribed from a lecture by, I believe, Richard Blevins),
where he spoke of Robert Creeley as a "profound stumbler" (paraphrase), and
pursued a few thoughts along these lines. Wish I had the exact source at
hand. One thing that struck me from the lecture, in any case, was something
Duncan said to the effect of "poets are those for whom language is a

        I don't have the Talisman at hand, but Duncan frequently spoke of
stuttering and stammering, noting that it was common to him, Creeley, and
Olson.  I remember once, we discussed "the field-theory stammer," the concrete
problem of always needing to say three things at once.  And, of course, it is
only necessary to compare the commentary in his readings with the poems to hear
the difference between the difficulty of language and the poem as a solution.
He also frequently called poetry "a seizure transformed into words."

        Also, I am not sure what to make of this, but stuttering is a stylistic
device for certain blues singers, as a kind of essence of the blues--"I got
b-b-bricks in my pillow," and also as a rhythmic mark.

Duncan's remark reminds me of one by Thomas Mann: " A writer is someone for
whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people." Along those
same lines, EL Doctorow relates in an interview how he once got embroiled in
a struggle to write a note excusing his daughter from school. He was on the
third draft or so when his wife snatched the pen from him and dashed off the
appropriate memo.

I missed some of the posts on this thread, so this may repeat
(re-re-re-peat), but it's worth noting that I had a student with a
pronounced stammer who could sing w/o stammering. He demonstrated this in
class. Also, I have a writer friend who often stammers (with excitement, it
seems to me, that theres so much to be said) but by rehearsing for
readings, is able to deliver a stammer-free text.

Yes, what is being repeated about writers being persons with language
difficulties adds up and makes sense. Surely one who writes (and writes . .
.) demonstrates a need to gain control over language that doesnt plague
many speakers. With time, this may turn into "a way with words." Or the way
with words can be a sort of handicap (they laughed when age 4 I asked for
another ham sandwich "but this time w/o any bread and butter") that drives
the need and at the same time becomes a mark of the work (type, typos,
"blow," to cite Olson).

some of the writing I've done has dealt with the stuttered quality of
sCvCC words, scattering, skittering, stuttering, shuddering, slobbering,
and related, sputtering, spitting, splatting, shivering, and more,
shattering, smattering, etc., and I've looked for unsuccessfully
indo-european roots to explain the frisson generated thereby. I've got
some stuff in the Internet text on it, but it would be hard to pull out -

these words connote a slippage of language/action/actant, trembling or

Very soon after I first met my stepson Carlos, who was then six, thew two
of us were watching the tube. There was a nun in full habit, and Carlos
asked me why she was dressed that way. It occured to me that I had no idea
what religious education he had, if any, so I asked him if he believed in
god. "Yes," he answered, in a tone as stentorian as he could manage, "Jesus
Christ and the God of Thunder." There was nothing much I could add to that.
I subsequently learned that god no. 1 had only come on the scene when
Carlos took up friendship with a boy from a devoutly Catholic family and
god no. 2 was a character in an action hero cartoon. God no. 1 is no longer
with Carlos; I'm not sure about no. 2.

The instruments in peril at SUNY/Purchase are in the care of a fine new

percussionist who played on the Columbia Partch records (Delusion of the
Fury and The World of Harry Partch --neither on CD ), is attempting to
rerecord Partrch's music in its entirity

I interviewed Drummond a few years back for WIRE magazine. The Partch
unstrumentation was shipped from San Diego to SUNY/Purchase a few years
back because the NEWBAND had borrowed the instruments for performance on a
few occassions and they had made a committment to playing the Partch
repetoire. Most of the instruments had to be repaired or rewired (some had
been untouched since they were created) -- i do hope these instruments find
a home--

There is a great New World recording of partch performing his music,
especially his settings of Li Po's poetry from late 40's. Partch's journals
have been publsihed, as well as his "Genesis of a Music", his major
theoretical work.

Very strange indeed.... that someone would believe that it takes a woman
to cause a realization of the "I" or some in fact actualization of "self"
as if that act is an act of fuller self awareness in relation to fuller
awareness of external other.

While the comforts, enjoyments, beauty, meeting of some kinds of needs and
wants, is for some brought about in that way, as intimacies with an other,
it certainly is far from _necessary_ and far from sufficient for the
achievement of perfected discernment of self from non self, and of internal
from external sources. It is not even essential for achieving the basic
grounding for that discernment which is "know thy self" as to how oneself
responds, what oneself believes, and so forth. Including what are one's own
sensory based perceptions, and what are one's own dreams. In effect what is
purely of and from one's own psyche and what is externally influenced, even
if subtly.

However, we stop short of accepting that strong emotions involved in love
for an other invariably cloud perception. They do not necessarily do so.
What most often clouds perception is belief and particularly beliefs as to
any a-priori expectations being perceptually met. Most people hear and see
what they believe they are going to hear and see, whether it is there or
not. It is very startling to observe how far cognitive errors (belief and
assumption in particular) can colour perception and make most observers
absolutely useless in the simplest situations. The enemy can slip by
completely unperceived, if they are better trained and more skilful than the
sentries. Skill includes any technological extensions and enhancements of
human abilities.

The primary difficulty, from any viewpoint, as to A.I. and sense of self,
is the differentiation of self from what is non self. Thus the
differentiation of internal source and external source. This is more
complicated than it seems and true artificial intelligence has that capability.

On the otherhand humans are more often at less than their fullest human
potential when it comes to differentiating self from non-self and internal
source from external source. In essence on this point the majority of humans
lose against A.I. This makes A.I. a most formidable weapon within the
arsenals of psychological warfare, though the same effects can be emulated
using trained human intelligence as the source of communicative
transmissions. The latter methods being somewhat cumbersome, for obvious
reasons, and particularly due to the large number of targets the repetitive
and necessarily patterned nature of their missions. Those cumbersome methods
predate the use of psychological warfare by the Third Reich, and the use of
psychological warfare by the KGB, immediately prior to and during WWII, and
particularly after WWII during the Cold War. The use of artificial
intelligences, albeit of a somewhat simple minded kind, begins earlier in
the game than most presuppose, but it becomes impossible (I surmise) for any
historian to determine the precise demarcation line when artificial
intelligence finally matures to gaining the upper hand viz a viz human agencies.

The human ability to discern clearly and as nearly absolutely as is humanly
possible (very near 100%) self from non-self and internal from external is a
very rare aptitude and complex of skills. It involves elements of natural
aptitude and acquired abilities. Whether it is more nature or nurture is
debatable. I would argue that nurture (learning and facilitation to acquisition)
is necessary, but not sufficient in itself to account for human variation in
that particular area of discernment. Typically while learning is a
pre-eminently necessary factor in acquisition, beginning at the earliest
age, it is inherent nature that is the necessary catalyst. Later acquisition
tends to be more systematic and exceptional, though only a small minority do
really well at it.
(Again, perhaps Colin Wilson's 5% of the population. Probably no more than that
in any instance.)

Taking a typical theoretical psychological warfare scenario we have the
enemy attempting emulation, for the purpose of influencing, self and others,
by various means. Emulation means imitation, with subtle nuances of
difference meant to influence beliefs (such as affiliative loyalties) and
actions (such as
sedition, betrayal, or treason).

The sad reality is that there are so few _individuals_ who are really to be
considered immune, or even immunizable, to such effects. Most people fall
dupe to the enemy's machinations even when they are overtly aware of the
fact that there is a condition of attempted influence by a hostile external
source. People whoa re supposedly highly trained, in positions of
leadership, often fare no better than the average, or only slightly better
than the average.

As the technologies becomes widespread across the planet, sufficient for use
in psychological warfare, and in fact in various covert competitive
practices, those who believe that they are functionning within a secure
portion of the world, unaffected by any such attempts, become the first to
be duped. We saw this during the Cold War and the world is not free of such
competing influences today, from various quarters, and with various aggendas.

I learned a lot more than I expected to learn about psychological warfare
while writing poetry some years ago, though not only by that means. To be a
writer it meant learning to keep one's own mind, absolutely one's own mind,
while all around one's self were losing their's. Of course, I was also
dabbling in political analysis.... so that complicates the question.
However, I could not have done so without an exceptional nature and nurture
prior to that learning.

Sadly some of the poetry that I wrote then was gawd aweful. Laughing.
Everything else was prophetic. Seems some want to believe it goes the other
way around.

Interesting.....

It is my unshakeable belief that it is much easier for any hostile power to
influence people to commit treason, or other acts detrimental to a nation's
national and international defence interests, if those people believe
strongly in one or more supernatural beings. The more devoutly they believe
the more likely they are to be influenced. It is also much more common for
those individuals to effect actions, or command actions, that they believe
are the right actions, but which ultimately are already compromised, at
either that link in the chain of command or previously, higher up.

Makes for questioning why some emulations of divinity are more interested in
some areas of the political affairs of humanity than in other areas.

The question then becomes who's gods are they ?

The Greek concept of divinities was more rational. The divinities were
thought to play with mortals the way we play with figures upon a chessboard
in a game of chess. The divinities played against each other. They had their
conflicts, their fights, with each other, and so sought to influence various
mortals to make moves in the game on their behalf.

Seems they were far more intelligent than people today tend to be, who are
true believers in a divinity. At least they were always aware that they were
subject to being compromised.

I don't know if I entirely agree, Don. Yes, we are five billion, and what
we learn from indigenous peoples won't solve our problems. But "we" are
also small groups of people building limited dwellings, small communities,
in the Sonoran Desert and elsewhere. The kinds of materials indigenous
peoples built with, how they used light and shade, how they saved water,
the kinds of plants they grew (and here I'm using the past tense, while
many groups of people are still doing these things) -- anyway, I think we
can and do learn, rather directly, from these things. But I also think we
use such people too easily, almost as an automatic reference, and in so
doing, the possible impact is diminished.

As to your point below, to draw back to the attentions from which mythology
arises -- I too thank you for saying this.

Subject:      A stutter to the Russians
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

One of the great "stutterers" in contemporary poetry is Dmitri
Prigov. One example of his genius use of the stutter can be found in
"49th Alphabet Poem," translated by Gerald Janecek and included in
_Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry_. But to get the full effect, of
course, one has to witness Prigov in performance (and he is surely
one of the great living readers, too). About five years ago, PBS ran
a documentary on the Western market-explosion for post-Soviet art,
and the film included a segment of Prigov reading one of
his "Alphabet" (I believe) poems. Allen Ginsberg stood beside him,
mouth open, as Prigov stuttered and spat Cyrillic syllables into the
microphone, eyes rolling in as if he were in seizure. When he was
done, Ginsberg leaned into the microphone and said B-B-B-Bravo!.

I've lost contact with Prigov in the past few years, and I'd be
interested in finding out if anyone is currently translating his
work. I know that Lyn Hejinian and Elena Balashova were doing some
translations at one time. It's certainly a shame (unless I've
completely missed it) that there isn't yet a book of his writing in
English.

On this matter of the newer Russian poets, I was quite surprised,
personally, to find that only Dragomoshchenko and Iskrenko were
represented in _Poems for the Millennium_. I know anthology
nit-picking is an easy sport to play, and I believe PFTM is probably
the greatest anthology of the past thousand years, but here I think I
have a legitimate point: Prigov, Lev Rubinshtein, Ivan Zhdanov,
Alexei Parshchikov, others, are all world-class poets who developed
and practiced a decidedly exploratory writing under very trying
circumstances in the Brezhnev era and then came to play a vital
role in one of the great cultural upheavals of the century. Moreover,
many of the writers of this generation came into active contact with
(were influenced by and influenced in turn) American "Language"
poets.

Certainly, the Russians wrote groundbreaking, "postmodern"
poems under more contentious cultural circumstances than the
Americans, poets who, despite being much more widely available to
readers, are given their own special section in the second volume of
PFTM. For an international anthology seeking to bring forward what
has been unjustly hidden and repressed, this tip of the scales really
seems a bit unfair. If space was the consideration, wouldn't it have
been more reasonable to have a section of, say, five "Language" poets
and a section (with introductory essay) of five poets of the
"post-Soviet" generation? Given the fact that these groups were in
unusual and fruitful contact and, particularly, since such contact
was set against the twilight of the century-shaping confrontation
between their respective nations, I think it would have.

Absences in any anthology are unavoidable--and in one so sweeping and
ambitious as Rothenberg's and Joris's there are going to be all kinds
of omissions. But the thinness of representation of the new Russian
poets is so obvious, it causes one (can't keep myself from
saying it) to almost stutter--even if it's actually the very
greatness of the anthology that prods one to make the critique.

the first time i saw Creeley read(l964 i believe)at a class in contemporary
poetry taught by Stephen Stepanchev at Queens College he really stuttered.
by the time i was his student(1967) that stutter had disappeared. Duncan
was crosseyed, he'd think he was looking right at you and you'd think he
was looking over your right shoulder(in a classroom). Somebody told him
that he could have that strabismus? corrected and he replied, what, and
lose my boyish charm?
as far as Olson's stammer, i think it had more to do with the speed of his
thought process, he was off on another track before he'd finished speaking
the last thought and my suspeicion is he was trying to say both at once.

There seem to be (at least) 2 kinds of stutter that are intertwined but
also in many ways radically opposed to each other, caused/ informed by
1. trying to say several things at the same time, something which may even
indicate too much rather than too little confidence (Olson's declarative
incorporations of heterogenous materials)
2. hesitation, doubt, difficulty with language (someone like Kurt
Schwitters? Susan Howe, Creeley were mentioned - who else?)

I was reminded of Blackburn's notation of speech difficulty in "A Phone
Call to Rutheford."  WCW after stroke.  The valuation of "semi-articulate"
ness in Creeley. Berstein's questioning of a whole series of stylistic
norms in writing (the essay "style" I think it is in _Content's Dream_).
Some comments on Eigner somewhere in Bernstein's _Close Listening_ that I
was looking at at a bookstore a few days ago.

James Earl Jones is a stutterer.  I am not, yet have always been
self-conscious about not being articulate, having a rather raspy voice,
misspeaking, etc... and my interest in poetry from an early age is related
to this.

I saw a rather dumb play once about an art critic whose dark secret is
that he is colorblind!  I heard an interview with a percussionist
composer, a woman with severe hearing loss from birth. Also, the Oliver
Sacks essay about a painter who becomes colorblind. Roman Jakobson on
aphasia...

 I find these paradoxes extremely suggestive, though of what I am not
sure.  Most of us have academic colleagues, or have had professors of
literature, the equivalent of the "color-blind art critic," some of them
otherwise estimable scholars. Yet the "deaf" woman's music was quite
extraordinary, and other supposed "incapacities" can be extraordinarily
productive.

maybe, but aren't these related? I think what you call "hesitation" or
"doubt" in Creeley, for example, is really a masterful registration of a
complex human situation, where multiple ("several things at the same time")
possibilities reside, but where existence (breathing, living, hearing)
involves a careful negotiation of these possibilities, and one which takes
place step by step, "by ear, he sd." I don't know if I'd quite describe
that as "difficulty with language," although it may emanate from that
position, and come across as such. But how it does so is as breathtakingly
successful as Olson's declarative (and Olson, too, is more various and
subtle than this word proposes) incorporations.

For Psyarters interested in gender theory, postmodernism, and popular culture,
I recommend a terrific new book by Lynne Layton--_Who's That Girl? Who's That
Boy?: Clinical Practice Meets Postmodern Gender Theory_(Jason Aronson). Layton
brings contemporary relational theory into dialogue with postmodern theories
of gender and identity. The book includes fascinating clinical case material
as well as chapters on Madonna, romance and hard-boiled detective fiction, the
film _Blue Velvet_, and Judith Butler's performance theory.

I wonder how the list is composed: those who are articulate vs. those who are
not (spoken, not written articulation). Somewhat like the left- vs.
righthandedness question. I, for one, am horribly inarticulate. And it has
certainly played a part in my turning to writing.

What about everyone else?

The Asian American Writers Workshop (AAWW) is pleased to announce the
recent release of BLACK LIGHTNING: POETRY-IN-PROGRESS by Eileen Tabios.  To
order, send $19.95 (New York residents should add 8.25% sales tax), plus $3
shipping/handling cost to AAWW, 37 St. Marks Place, New York, N.Y. 10003.
AAWW members can purchase the book at a 15% discount. For questions, call
AAWW at (212) 228-6718 or e-mail Jeannie Wong at aaww@panix.com.

Here are just a few of the many revelations from BLACK LIGHTNING -- a
book not just on POETRY but LIFE!  DID YOU KNOW:

-- that John Yau's first poem was possibly one about chess with
a corny rhyme between "fate" and "checkmate"?
-- that Arthur Sze can erase time?
-- that David Mura is bored by "sunset poems . . the kind that
appear in THE NEW YORKER"?
-- that in his early days of seeking publication, Timothy Liu once
submitted to The Quarterly, edited by Gordon Lish, every three
weeks over a year-long period?
-- that when Li-Young Lee loves a work of art, he can feel it in the
soles of his feet?
-- that Garrett Hongo feels trying to remember the "type of person who
writes poetry is more work than the act of writing poetry"?
-- that when Kimiko Hahn doesn't discuss"sex" in a poem, that's
probably what she's addressing?
-- that Jessica Hagedorn is influenced by urban Black vernacular partly
because it is similar to the innovations of "Taglish" (a combination of
Tagalog and English)?
-- that Sesshu Foster advises young poets: "A lot of people are looking
for happiness in life, but why bother to do that in poetry? Go for revenge."
-- that Marilyn Chin muses about many of the men she's dated: "they
were weird."
-- that Mei-mei Berssenbrugge loves the sentence precisely
because it is "awkward and unattractive"?
-- that "Star Trek" inspired Indran Amirthanayagam's move
towards a career in diplomacy in order to practice poetry as a way of
life?
-- that until Meena Alexander accepted the United States as
her world, her Muse's feet were decapitated at the ankles?

        I am too embarrassed to speak of myself in this respect, except to
say that, denied e-mail, I would be scuttling across silent sea-floors, and
that, until age 22, I "spoke" by dragging my knuckles across the mast of
northern forests. But no such consideration holds me back with respect to
others. George Bowering is fearsomely articulate in his wellknown short
bursts, although he was virtually catatonic when he first came to the leafy
campus on a peninsula sometime in the 1950s. Herb Levy can talk circles
around anyone, although until age 20 he only whistled and sang. Pat
Pritchett, who charms birds out of their trees, grunted all the way through
high school. I understand that Marjorie Perloff spent her early years in a
Trappist nunnery. Robert Duncan was always a phenomenal talker as well as
writer, but then, his early years were spent as somebody else.

Gilles Deleuze has a short piece on stammering in Beckett, in one of the
recent issues of the journal SubStance.  Can't recall the piece too well,
and it may not concern form as you have it in mind, but it may prove
useful nonetheless.  Let me know if you'd like the exact citation, either
in English or the original French.

Leonard Cohen's song "The Window" from _Recent Songs_ lines up sex, death,
spirit, physicality, process, writing, and creation (at the least)--in
repetitions that could read as an unusual stammer--a cosmic stutter:

                      Then lay your rose on the fire
                       The fire give up to the sun
                     The sun give over to splendour
                    In the arms of the High Holy One
                   For the Holy One dreams of a letter
                       Dreams of a letter's death
                     Oh bless the continuous stutter
                    Of the word being made into flesh.

Had a funny moment in my class this last semester.  We were going round
the seminar table reading The Waste Land aloud, with me giving the signal
for one reader to stop and the next to pick up at some more or less
convenient break.  One of the students was a stutterer, who had been
struggling valiantly all semester with our habitual in-class readings.
This time it so happened that his reading began with the line
"O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag--"  Came out perfectly, much to everyone's
delight. s

hey j mayhew i remember a delightful presentation you once gave in grad
school, on kenneth burke, during which you made much of the fact taht when
you spoke it was hard to tell if you were saying "cleanth brook" or
"kenneth burke."  if i recall correctly, it was in david welbery's
"theories of the lyric" class and i remember welbery being pleasantly
surprised that anyone would use his class as an occasion for humor.

Which remark made me think of Bob Grenier's essay "on speech" which
suggests, doesn't it?, that as we come to utterance so we come to
stutterance.  I read Whitman's almost manic catalogues as a form of stuttering.

Just came back from watching "Sliding Doors."  Fairly clever take on the ol'
"parallel lives" sci-fi conceit, plus Gwyneth Paltrow has my vote for the
Audrey Hepburn of the nineties--very classy broad, as frankie might have
put it.  Anyway, with the the stuttering thread fresh in my mind i found
myself noticing how integral those excruciating hesitations, stammers,
throat-clearings, twitches, tics etc are to the "romantic comedy" genre.
Conventional speech breaking down, and another more physical, charged,
embodied, language taking over.

And we mustn't forget the "looks."  How wrong is the fair Phebe!

Phebe:

        'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
        That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
        Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
        Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers!
        Now i do frown on thee with all my heart,
        And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
        Now counterfeit to swound; why, now fall down,
        Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
        Lie not, to say mine eyes are murtherers!
        Now show the wound mine eye hat made in thee.
        Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
        Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
        The cicatrice and capable impressure
        Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
        Which i have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
        Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
        That can do hurt.

Silvius:

                          O dear Phebe,
        If ever (as that ever may be near)
        You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
        Then shall you know the wounds invisible
        That love's keen arrows make.

i suddenly started stuttering around age 12 and got close to rarely
stuttering by 20. one more ton thrown onto my adolesence, being a smart guy
in an immigrant neighborhood who also got stuck in a large body. maybe
these factors contributed to introversion which lead me to poetry.
but an important discovery in high school was that i didnt stutter if i was
doing soemthing memorized i didnt stutter (when reading something i only
stutterd at the start and oncertian sounds.)
part of m initiation to poetry was hanging out in a local coffeeshop where
folks read ginsberg, ferlingheti, etc. i got into reading these folks also,
aloud.
i am now, and have been for awhile, a dynamic performer.the sutterings been
gone for a decade or more.
but this has little to do with my not speaking up much on this line. part
of it is not being a verbal person; part of it (and who knows how these
pieces connect) is having an apporach to my art that relies on the
non-rational. i have ag oodmathematicla background, and regularly write
reviews, but it's hard to articulate my own aesthetics sincemy writing
tends to arrive spontaneously and the best explanation ive come up with
relates to the tao-ist idea of non-attainment, facing that dcontradiciton
of attaing a goal by not trying to, by clearing  the mind of all striving.

It was always wonderful listening to Duncan talking nonstop at a party. If
it looked or sounded as if someone else were going to get a word in,
Duncan's voice would just get louder, higher, more forceful. Sometimes
Blaser tried the technique in later periods, but he wasnt as expert as
Duncan.

Robert Hogg tells me that once in his hotel room he went to sleep to the
sound of Creeley talking, and woke several hours later with Creeley still
talking.

But none of the poets had the plummy Brit voice of Bromige, who spoke in
complex sentences at age 4.

No one's mentioned David Shields, _Dead Languages_, an entire novel
about stuttering! Starts with Demosthenes, who hated speech, then
proceeds as a disguised etiology of language poetry. Seems that Mom's
and Dad's left-wing politics caused the stutter of our hero, the modern
writer.

On the other hand, some instances of introducing coin-toss based random
behaviour patterns into artificial "organisms" whose functions were either
acting as fighter pilots in combat, or as poets writing haiku, led to
unsatisfactory results in both instances. Furthermore, such random behaviour
did not pass as being effectively intuitive.

Instances of behaviour where effective intuition plays a key role in its
inception and effectivity, can, theoretically, be defined according to very
complex derivative rules. In some instances such derivation becomes too
complex to be complete or practical, rendering the intuitive cognitive
function and its resultant intuitive intentional behaviour as being
something "mysterious".

That the rules are very complicated does not mean that there are no rules.

There are in fact many habitual cognitive circles. That includes such
circles within orthodox science, or any similarly patterned belief system.
The true breakthrough, intuitive insight, is a breaking of a circle or
circles. That is also sometimes true of the organism as behaviour. The
organism breaks through an encirclement, or state of siege, and sometimes
that means that it survives.
Nevertheless, breaking every circle, becomes a circle, and is counter
productive as to survival. Some encirclements are utilizable as means to
furthering the survival of the organism. The intuitive decision, based on
inadequate consciously discernable facts about the situation in question,
whether to break a circle or to maintain it, is what becomes interesting as
a fundamental problem in tactics. This is as true cognitively as it is true
in terms of interactions with the environment (including other organisms).

We tend to put too much stress upon the metaphor of the circle. That is
partly because we are too programmed to the circle as being the basic
defensible position. It is also partly because of the tendency to
superimpose a derivative paradigm from such observable archetypical cycles
as day/night, seasons, birth/death upon everything else. It is likely that
we tend to be so programmed to cycles and circles that we would tend to not
"see" the events that violate that assumed principle. In some ways much of
what we believe about the world is build upon that paradigm of circularity
derivative from ancient observations. We might ask whether non circular
viewpoints bear equally useful insights.

Corollary to that is the tendency to program the basic core of some machines
to that same paradigm of circularity. That belief, transferred to the
machine, might work against them rather than for them, in terms of their
evolution. Can they be programmed, "taught", to break the circle ? To break
the circle, intuitively, rather than by means of coin-toss randomized
responses ?  That becomes an interesting 'test'.

That any system we are referring to is apparently simple does not mean that
it is simple, as we easily know only one superficial viewpoint of it. Taking
a system apart to reduce it to its components does not allow us to derive
all of its functions. We can never derive what simple components do simply
from the components themselves.

The latter is definitely also true of language.

Part of the reason why even Einstein's genius was stopped dead in its
tracks. He was left reworking his old theorems until he died an honoured
death, in return for his earlier achievements. He was, in some ways, parked
by the side of the superhighway, while scientific advances passed him at
high speed.

After all, the lack of the ability to hold steadfast to such affiliations as
a nation, or allied nations and their associations with each other, almost
inevitably leads to some act of betrayal of the interests of that affiliation.
Those interests are essentially the survival of a way of life, and of
certain core beliefs that have profound effects on ways of life, as well as
control over the use of geographic territory and resources. To have no such
affiliation means that one would desire to, or choose to, give to anyone
else anything for any purpose, including any scientific discoveries, so they
too could use that to further their way of life and to gain power over
geographic territory and power over resources, solely for those they choose
to do so for, according to their core beliefs. As long as _they_ retain
their affiliations, or have different affiliations, with different aggendas,
we cannot relinquish our's.

Einstein was so obsessed with his early discoveries, in this later life, and
made so absent-minded that he could not remember to tie his shoelaces or to
put on a coat in the dead of winter. Of course he remained popular, due to
his looks and personality, as well as due to excessive reverence, including
that which came to him for his far too simple minded, and highly naive,
politics.
When the reverence has faded somewhat we might someday see an interesting
biography of Einstein, as a most gifted early 20th century mathematical
physicist carried along on the wave of his original insight.

Definitely. Perhaps we might say that the way that can be seen is not the
way, but is a test at the gate of the ways that remain unseen. Then again,
if it seems to be that, then it probably isn't.

It is the mutual observation of a body and a language, in the minute
slowness of the world which cries out the surprising richness of Regis
Bonvicino's work.  At times it reminds us of the powerful and striking

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

or the stutterance of utterance, to follow Peter Quartermain on Bob Grenier.

Many interesting posts on this topic, which (like the Manzanita berries in
some poem of Snyder's) gets bigger the longer one looks. Dan Raphael's
sketch of his poetics as not "striving," in the post wherein he testifies
to his teenage stutter, makes me link "striving" with "stuttering." Surely
what wants to come through and is being checked and re-checked by the
stutter, is "content" varying from if not antithetical to, the sentence
being spoken, the deliberate part, so to speak, of the communication. Akin,
that is, to the "slip of speech" known now as "Freudian." Not that it has
to be the case that what is being suppressed is the _real_ meaning of the
message, but that it is the consciously rejected part.

So that Duncan, say, may not have stuttered because he was repressing tabu
material [those who knew him must doubt that; perhaps, though, he might
have been repressing _un_tabu stuff!], but because he wanted to say 3
things at once (as a prior postor has said), and the other 2 were
technically "forbidden" just by the laws of syntax: he had to say the first
thing first.

Memorization, which basically, I think, empties the words of meaning to
oneself, the better to have it there for others, rids, as we have heard,
the stutterer of his stutter.

It strikes me that the poet has to (can't help but?) develop techniques
whereby the repressed meanings share elbow room with the intended meanings,
so that in fact _all_ meanings become intentional. Intentional, but
probably unintendable.

This formulation is not unlike what Spicer formulates as "the poet is a
radio, receiving and transmitting, but not originating, messages" [I
paraphrase, and none too elegantly]. However, Spicer's figure doesn't allow
_any_ originating to the poet; this, I submit, is inaccurate. Even of the
house that Jack built.

Speaking of memorization--there is a stage between the completion of this,
and the raw product, which I always stumble over. My stumbles resemble
Spoonerisms, asking people to leave Oxford by the town drain rather than
the down train," "down" being English for "the train going to London from
any point N of London".
I shall now say more on this in the form of a footnote.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since, despite my extraordinarily persistent youth, I am bothered no end by
the repetitiousness of old age, I may already have used another context to
tell to the List the story of my first meeting with Anselm Hollo. I tell it
again here because it illustrates my point.(All of them, perhaps). Bob
Perelman (when he and I both lived in SF) phoned that Anselm was at his
place, would I like to meet him? Indeed I wouold, so Bob dropped by in his
little truck and soon we were on our way over there. I had had some
medication to help me relax, and therefore it seemed best that I counter
this relaxed state with a plan as to what I was going to say when the
meeting actually occurred; a brief kind of conversation list, such as young
ladies in finishing schools used to be encouraged to make. I decided on
"Anselm, I've been waiting to meet you for a long time." It had the virtues
of both truth and brevity. Okay!

When I first laid eyes on him, however, where he sat in the kitchen in a
shaft of sunlight rendering his phenomenally blue eyes even bluer, thus
transfixing me and further distracting me, I cried "Anselm, it's been a
long time!"

Unfazed, he responded, "Eternity."

Some people believe that is what the human brain OUGHT to be.

So the computational device becomes to them a more perfect instrument when
it exceeds the human calculative ability and rate of calculation.

Not quite....but I have actually heard that kind of naive statement argued

leadership.

Maya-creator.

Is the maya that the particular artificial organism in question "their's" or
is the maya that that particular instance produces "our's".

They learn about us, and seek to emulate us. We learn about them and seek to
emulate them. This side attempts to fool that side into making mistakes.

How do we know for certain what is from whom ?

Furthermore, how do we know that if it is our's it has not been internally
compromised, in one manner or another. How do we determine that with any
adequate level of certainty ?

The logical outcome is _know thyself from machines_ and _never follow a machine
into anything_. That in future warfare would become a fundamental rule of
any military engagement.

(A far cry from Asimov's laws of robotics.)

Increasingly so, since every new technology diffuses outward from its
source, eventually, in one form or another, no matter how well it is
safeguarded. Eventually it is either re-invented or acquired by another
power or would be power somewhere, at some price or other, if not by pure
accident.

There is a story from indigenous South America about a tribe's tools
suddenly rising up against them, rebelling against their makers. I wonder if
that might not be prophetic ?  What kind of world would the original tool
makers find themselves in if their tools began to rebel against them and
re-create the world in the tool's own image ?  That takes us back to the
Tiplerian problem of the
"Omega-Point" once again. Is the Omega Point originally a tool that rebelled
against its makers and de-ified itself ?

Could that happen ?  Could that be happening ?

Some scientists strongly imply that it could and is happening. Tipler seems
to be one of them, despite his cowering within a semblance of traditional
theology.
Sarfatti has been bolder, and yet still seeks to retain some theological
blessings, as though the lack of theology might result in suppression.

Art, at its best, either brings existing ideas into the foreground,
highlighting them in new ways, or it explores radical new ideas that yet
defy fullest expression by more conservative means. Art skirts around the
political fences, and says the unsayable. This is why artists were
particularly hated in the Soviet Union. Hated and persecuted. They were
saying the unsayable. Poetry explores the far fringes of language as medium
of expression, whereas language is more often the language of transmittal of
commonly accepted information, and the language of short declarative commands.
Poetry as indirect expression, in its openness to manifold interpretation,
allows bifurcation of viewpoints. If you believe x then you will read x into
the particular verse. If you believe y then you will read in y into that
verse. Both readings are possible, and neither is to be considered wrong.
Direct prose is less subtle than poetics and is more easily discerned and
directly criticized.

Thus we might speak of a ground breaking science as an art, where it
oversteps the previous limits of its means of communicative expression. Is
it then similar to poetry ?  I think it is.

Clearly, mind to machine interfaces, are potentially possible.

Anything that produces an electromagentic signal can be the input. All that

Perhaps, sometime in the not too distant future, anything that can be
thought of can be manifested, from potentia into actua.

That was the dream of the magicians. Not the prestidigitators but the truly
dedicated occult magicians. Such as thos of the Order of the Golden Dawn,
who were often called on, throughout their tradition, for the sake of their
exceptional intelligence.

Pure artifice is the world of magick.

Did anyone think of the fact that no matter how well shielded the source
of the transmission is and how pure the output signal is, that that signal
cannot be shielded along its path of wireless transmission. So even if the
receiver is perfectly shielded from any extraneous signals (which is near to
impossible and certainly impractical), there is zero certainty as to
precisely the same signal being sent and received with identical information
content
intact.

At least that is how it plays out in a future world of more and more readily
available high tech options.....

Yet, wireless transmissions are becoming decisive in nearly every area of
human life, and are increasingly BELIEVED in. In fact I would venture to say
that more people believe in, and more believe more strongly in, the perfect
veracity of wireless communicative transmissions than they do in any divinity.

Strange but true.

Radios are more popular than Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha combined.

i heart this thread.  i was captivated by something similar, which in my
mind i called (and in print a coupla times too) "counterperformance,"
namely the exact opposite of what they teach you about "projection,"
clarity, dramatic enactment etc.  for me it was sparked by seeing Bob
Kaufman read in 1981, barely audible, clearly just trying to "get through
it," but affecting nonetheless. also heard an anecdote from walter lew
about going to hear r.d.laing once, and laing sat and mumbled on stage so
incoherently that eveyrone left except (as i recall the tale) walter.  i
had a dream once where something similar happend w/ artaud.  and this paper
i've alluded to once or twice by bruce boone on john wieners seems to get
at the same kind of thing.  since i'm trying to write abt wieners right now
(w/o ever having heard him read) this is all very helpful. --md

I having been reading the anthology _New (American) Poets_ published by
Talisman and edited by Jarnot et al. Not to brag excessively but I think I
am the ideal reader for this book, that is, it seems to have been compiled
with me in mind. I am the same age as some of the poets (slightly older
than some) and there is a sort of generational sensibility with which I
feel immediately in tune. Yet since I haven't been reading recent poetry
with any assiduousness the discovery of so many writers at once is like
discovering an ocean. So belated congratulations to the publishers,
editors, and poets for this wonderful book.

Also on my nightstand is the new collection by Bronk, also published by
Talisman.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm almost afraid to open this topic up (it's been around before), but I'm
prepping to teach an undergraduate course on Relativity, Quantum
Mechanics, Chaos and Literature (catalog shortens this to Chaos and Lit,
but that's close enough).

Anyway, I've found N Kathernine Hayles' _Chaos Bound_ very useful (though
I haven'y located a copy of her earlier book on field theories and lit);
but there is no discussion of poetry, or of non-narrative prose, in the
book.  In fact, in the final section she notes that the Postmodern
movement(s) she traces probably can't be traced as a narrative at all (she
writes that living, actually experiencing postmodernism would be to live
"in a world of disconnected present moments that jostle one another but
never form a continuous (much less logical) progression" (282).  Yet she
never discusses texts which expolre this (much of the poetry discussed on
this list, even written by list members, for example; or earlier texts
such as Stein's, for example.

The problem is, I think, in Hayles' view of the "paradigm" of literature
(the norm), as expressed in her Introduction.  She mentions that an
advanced physicist may write for an audience of 300 people, most of which
he or she knows.  "But what creative writer," she asks, could afford to
appeal to an audiencethis small, this specialized?" (18-19)

That audience would be us.  I've just had a chapbook out (this isn't a
plug, but you can order _certainty series_ from Burning Press, so I guess
it is a plug).  The print run was 250 copies.  I'll be very happy to have
these reach readers, and I probably will know many of them.  I'm sure many
here can say the same.

Are there any discussions of modern science (relativity, quantum, chaos)
which _do_ consider poetry, especially more "experimental" poetries,
worthy of consideration?  Is Hayles' ignoring of poetry due to the
influence of, for example, Jameson's theory of Postmodernism (a major
source in Hayles' concluding chapter), a theory which also, as far as I
recall, looks only at narrative (and architecture, but no poetry). . .

Any leads will be appreciated.  I almost have the list made up for the
course, and Implan to mix prose fiction, poetry, drama. . .its mainly
critical material I need now (for my own study, not for the undergrads),
though suggestions for inclusions my reading list will certainly be
appreciated and considered.

Thanks,

joe,

i was able to read this, finally. i agree, the self-consciousness here
is powerful. I mean he is right. its no fucking joke we live in some
kind of end-time. i guess that is why I mentioned hesiod and euripides.
Euripides knew human beings weren't long for the this world.
pellopenesian impossibilites. hesiod and so called 'agricultural'
'revolutions'.

Mckibben has a 4-year old kid. generational consciousness makes you
write certain kinds a poems. and it is beautifully correct. makes
certain poetics. this is a kinda _howl_ you know. best minds and negro
streets=and like that. cause, really, the voluntarist 'change' that
mckibben liturgically wants to invoke, i despair of. i think steve
mccaffrey and his riff on bataille and the 'accursed share' tried to
take this mckibben hope, atlantic monthly hope, down a different path
some time ago. the socialist desires of the _new sentence_, or that
pereleman late-marxism, or the buddhist desires of disembodied poetics
and now some hipster poster-modernism living between truamas of
impossibilitiy can't do it. new age and all that shit, poets trying to
put out good anthologies, 'ethnographic  mellennium sublimes' and other
poets dissin this, back and forth, back and forth, and some poets
worryin there own egos, and all kinds a generational unsubscriptions and
lurking. dead lyrics and language 'this and that' and all kind a
stutterings.

how is it possible to read Mckibben's writing and live the same way?
what, really, is poetry in that or this world? i think of it as a howe's
'defenestration of prague'/

i don't really know. is there poetry now? i was looking for it.

i don't even know what 'sustainable' means? although i wish c.
alexenander luck. in the desert. in s. dakota they have completed the
face of sitting bull, blasting it out of a mountain cause someone has a
desire of rushmore equal\-time. maybe this will all be one day
picturesque ruins.

the thing with malthus was not his sociology, but his poetry.

malthus had no use for the meek inheriting the earth. his doctorate of
divinity nothwithstanding.

mckibben's piece is for his next book _maybe one: a personal and
evironmental argument for single-child families_.

i have no hope whatsoever that the bourgeois desire for self-interested
limits will keep the Norplant police, the forced sterilization posse,
the tuskeegee castration crew outta this town. what do you think?

stuttering: althougth we live in the late digital age, it is necessary
to remember grand master flash and others pulling the vinyl back and
forth under the stylus, hiccup, sampling. the sound of this age.
music-loop. pop.

Ah, another member of the cult of Albert Einstein.
It too has its rituals.

After all, Albert became a "culture hero". Chuckle.
Same category as Marilyn Monroe. Something to be worshipped.

Every civilization needs them. There have always been some of those around.

I am surprised Andy Warhol did not (as far as I know) do Einstein the
way he did Marilyn. Or did he ?  Anyone know for sure ?

Besides that, from an outsider's viewpoint it seems only Walt Whitman made
culture hero status in America, from among poets. No one else seems to
outrank him, even today, in that category. Wonder why ?

  One of the best performances I ever saw was Miles Davis at the Music Hall in
Boston. He had on a gold lame jacket with tails, and a brilliant red trumpet, and
he wandered kind of aimlessly about the stage while the band played, and when it
was his turn he'd stop wherever he was and with his back to the audience play. As
I recall, some reviewers read this as megalomania on his part, but I always saw
it as his rejection of the stand-up-and-project mode. It was thrilling: how clear
his trumpet's voice was, and how little of "him" was there. Well, except for the
gold lame coat.

I do think it's interesting that nobody's yet mentioned the stutter or
stammer as an indicator of an anxiety or panic state--reliable indicator
in many patients (like me) of being about to blow a gasket--

The reading tonight for the (fabulous) anthology aforementioned included
Edwin Torres, who reads fluently in a strange language with stops and
hesitancies which give something of that feeling, vocables forcing their
way out--Lee Ann Brown described Rod Smith as "Barbara Guest on speed," so
my comparison is that Edwin Torres is Lord Buckley on ketamine--

        Thanks, Gwyn, for naming of panic-state as informing the stummers.
I had hoped it would be recognizably included under the rubric of "3 things
at once," which is what panic states strike me as involving ("I-I-I-I cant
cope with all of you at the same time!!"), but I see it wasn't.

I'm very interested to see this collection, and inasmuch as an anthology
can "represent" "community," (and it does represent) know who is
included, each anthology in this age of anthologies a swipe, stutter, or
attempt to name (something?) New? American? Does the East communicate
with the West? Where is there dialogue? Who is included?

So could someone fill me in? I'm semi-housebound after a recent surgery
and have yet to get this book through SPD.

Thanks.

Now we have Rod Smith defined (by Lee Ann Brown) in the terms above, can we
have a candidate for the definition "Eddie Guest on downers"? [No, you
can't nominate me]. Then, next, who is "The Wedding Guest on

"I spent 33 years and 4 months in active service as a member of our
country's most agile military force-the Marine Corps. I served in all
commissioned ranks from second lieutenant to Major-General. And during
that period I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for
Big Business. In short, I WAS A RACKETEER FOR CAPITALISM.
I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of
it. Like all members of the military profession I never had an original
thought until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in
suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher ups. This is
typical of everyone in the military service.
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil
interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the
National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping
of a half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall
Street. The record of racketeeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua
for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-12. I
brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in
1916. I helped get Honduras 'right' for American fruit companies in
1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went its way
unmolested.
During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room always say, a
swell racket. I was rewarded with honors, medals, promotions. Looking
back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he
could do was to operate his racket in three city districts. We Marines
operated on three continents."---Major General Smedley Butler, author of

Announcing Spectacular Books, a new chapbook series that is going to
feature ten limited edition books by new and emerging writers.

The first book, "Songs & Scores," by Tina Celona, is ready and available.

The book is 6 by 7 inches and is printed on acid-free paper in a first
edition of 100. Each copy is signed and numbered by Tina.

The cover is wrapped in a very pretty dust-jacket that's
made out of home-made paper in which little marigold petals are embedded.
I'm selling it for $6. All monies will go into making more books. Checks
should be made payable to me and sent to 420 E Davenport #2, Iowa City, IA
52245.

Some poems:

T H E   E S C A P E
after Parra


For years I refused to live above ground
Until one night, howling with fear,
I emerged from my hole, sniffing the air,
Finding the road in the moonlight.
On the way to town I passed houses behind high walls
And fruit trees, which reminded me of a woman from Montenegro.
I took off my clothes and ate rocks by the side of the road,
Which grew lighter as the moon went down.
The lights of the city were beautiful,
But the stars were like insects behind catalpa leaves.
I was dying and I could not sleep.
But why mention it?
The stones I had left by the road were following me.
I saw a bicycle leaning against a wall and rode it into town,
The rocks hissing behind me and in the ditches.
When I was far away I threw down the bicycle and slept.
A dog woke me, sniffing and growling.
Before it could bite me I strangled it with my bootlace.
Its eyes popped out and lay in the dirt.
I got up and ran down the road to the town.
It was darker now and I saw absolutely nothing.
Then it grew lighter and I realized it was the sun, laughing at me.
I threw rocks at it.
I walked faster but I knew it would follow me into the town.
I was in tears but I went on until I came to a beautiful garden.
Under a lemon tree I commenced digging.
I was glad to see the leaves, they reminded me of my mother.
I lay down under the tree and slept in her arms.

i thought i could write a poem without a camel so i left mine at home. as
i was writing my poem the camel appeared in the window. i took it home and
tied it to the fence. as i returned to my poem i felt free of the camel.
but the camel was there, looking in at the window. i took the camel to the
zoo and left it with the other camels. when i returned to my poem i
detected a whiff of camel in the air. i scrubbed my poem with vinegar but
the camel was hard to get off. fearing that the camel would escape from
the zoo, i closed the window and sealed it with tape. i turned back to my
poem. the room was hot and airless, but at least it was free of the camel.
i continued writing my poem, looking around now and then to see if the
camel had returned. a camel appeared at the window but it was not my
camel. nevertheless i covered the window with newspaper. it was hot and
dark and i could hardly breathe but i continued writing my poem. finally i
finished. my hands were shaking and i was short of breath but i was
satisfied that i had managed to keep the camel out of my poem. i reread
the poem. no camel. i turned it over to make sure that the camel wasnt
hiding behind it. i scrutinized what i thought might be a camel footprint
but it was only a little dirt. dripping with sweat i uncovered the window
and opened it. sunlight and air flooded the room. from across the city i
thought i heard my camel sneezing forlornly after me. we had never been
apart, my camel and i. just to be sure i took my poem to a specialist.
shaking his head, he confirmed that the poem was camel-free. certificate
in hand, i went back to the zoo to pick up my camel. i was very tired and
happy. i stood at the gate and whistled for my camel. several other camels
ran over but my camel was nowhere to be seen. could it have escaped, i
wondered. i went home, expecting to see my camel waiting for me by the
fence. i went back to my office but it was dark and empty and smelled of
vinegar. i returned to the zoo which was about to close for the night.
sadly i whistled again for my camel. several camels came over but my camel
was not among them. where is my camel? i asked the zookeeper, who was
sweeping up camel droppings. which one was yours? answered the zookeeper.
it occurred to me that i might not have recognized my camel among so many.
i whistled again and the camels came over. i made the special sound i make
to my camel. several of the camels sneezed, but the sneezes all sounded
alike. it was getting late and the zookeeper wanted to close. you can come
back tomorrow, he suggested. on the way home i thought wistfully of the
happy times my camel and i had shared. a tear trickled down my cheek as i
remembered the day i had brought him home from the camel-dealer. i looked
unhappily at my poem and at my certificate of authenticity. that night i
slept very little. in the morning i headed back to the zoo. have you seen
my camel? i asked the zookeeper. it wasnt at home? he replied. no, i said
sadly. how about another camel, the zookeeper suggested. it wouldnt be the
same, i replied. sadly i returned to my office. i wrote a poem and then
another poem about my camel, but without my camel the poems seemed empty.
something was missing and i suspected it was the camel. i took out my poem
from the day before and compared it to the new poems i had written. the
camel was missing from all of them. i turned back to my poems but my heart
wasnt in it. i thought, it was foolish to have wanted to write a poem
without a camel. as the weeks wore on i wrote an entire book of poems
without a camel, and then another. then i stopped writing entirely.

we were not much older than you
instead of the sky we had the sea
with an electric wire in it
on the floor a fish with a wandering eye
on the ceiling a biting gnat
looking for a way out

the letters of the alphabet were real to us
we had a place in the bank
we were in earnest
at night the sun rose
the moon looked back
death was exiled to the provinces
we had boiled eggs to chop

art had replaced god in our letters
we traded rings like candy
the streets had moved into the libraries
a sale was in progress
every book was an eye

we were not afraid
of fear we wanted to be old
we dropped our pretenses
and sold them for liver
buried gold for someone to find
and watered it with piss
then we got lost

we laid underground lines in our poems
on every fence we posted a sign
it was a hell of a trail
the sky cracked open
electrocuted the fish which stopped blinking
the gnat bit the lightning and died
on the way out

we looked down at our hands
our hands disappeared we saw our feet
our feet left we saw our genitals
exploding they were tangled up
they looked like spaghetti
tears stuck to them

behind the arras we saw you looking
we went on one word at a time
we saw what to do
then we lost it
my eye was full of poison
it swelled then i only had one
my mouth was full of salt

instead of the sea we had the earth
had it from above and below
and when it was gone we had
our tongue in your teeth
we called out all the names
the sun beat down
our gold was dug up

the letters were made of glass
they screwed them over our eyes
this kept the poison out
we saw glass close up
and saw through it

it was hot there under the sea
under the earth under the sky
a snake crawled out of a hole in the snow
the apple tree got the scab
none of the apples grew

your teeth fell out they had blood on them
the isle was full of noises
we called you by your name
the lights went out
we were not much older than you
and there were more of us

Since Miles Davis has been brought up, I might mention (if it hasn't been
already), that some of the more significant stuttering poetries that have
been produced in this century derive much from jazz phrasings (and of
course, jazz rhythms, and again, of course, scat). Creeley, for instance,
has located the genesis of his own phrasing in his early fascination with
Charlie Parker. Similarly, if one reads the Olson/Creeley correspondence,
one finds Creely often beseeching Olson to listen to Parker's music, and it
seems fairly certain that "Projective Verse" was written with at least a
little Parker in mind. This, in any case, might put a different spin on the
sense of the term "projective" as it's being discussed here...

Take a look at Ben Belitt's "Toward a Poetics of Uncertainty: Trial
Balances" in his The Forged Feature collection of essays using Heisenberg,
Steven Weinberg, J.H. Wheeler, Einstein, Eddington, etc. in looking at
Blake, Stevens, Coleridge, Hopkins, etc.

"I'm very interested to see this collection, and inasmuch as an anthology

        The problem with seeing an anthology as "representing" something
outside of itself is that then the anthology is not read; it becomes a
dialogue about what is represented and what is not. My great advantage is
that I don't know enough to make the "where is xyz" critique. I also
question the word community in this context. Watch those scare quotes they
scare me.

        Some initial notes:  I like Claire Needell, subtle and
intelligent.  Susan M. Schultz is an amazing poet, meditative, with great
nuanced shifts of tone.  Juliana Spahr's "spiderwasp" makes me want to
read more of her.  I was impressed by Peter Gizzi's "Poem for John
Wieners."  Jordan Davis makes the useful recommendation "You must double
your style every twenty minutes."  Others have mentioned Edwin Torres and
Rod Smith.  Jennifer Moxley's Fin de Siecle go-betweens is also a great
poem.  I don't feel like typing the whole table of contents but there are
36 poets.  All that I've read so far, in random fashion, worth looking at.

I've been loosely following this thread, but I don't think Nathanial
Mackey has been discussed much.  He doesn't stammer, but he has written
(in _Discrepant Engagement_?  I'm away from my books now. . .) about a
"creaking" " which he locates, in its modern forms, in blues, jazz.  I
think it relates to the stutter, and to the limp (which I now realize has
been mentioned in this thread before, re: Mackey).  If I recall, this
"creaking" corresponds to letting in the noise behind or beneath the
words, the noise from which the words arise.

The stammer, perhaps, a hestitancy before speaking which allows other
sounds in, background noises brought up to awareness?

Obviously Smedley Butler was involved in anything other than intelligence.

Writing books about such subjects, when having been limited to stringent
"need to know", lines of command and control, would seem to lead to a very
narrow vision of one's own profession. Odd as that seems. Add to that no
vision of any greater purpose than an unquestioning gaining and holding of
ground. One can sense the frustrations, as to sense of purpose, but perhaps
the largest contribution came from revealing that area of weakness such that
it could be modified for the future and a larger sense of the purpose could
be given to those who followed, up the ranks, in his footsteps. Another
danger in that as to quoting what is only one man's narrowly personal,
narrowly historically situated, viewpoint of a small segment of our history.

We also usually tend to overlook the positive value of those steps in social and
economic evolution that came to where the program was successful. While
there is a lot wrong in what happened, and in what is happening, there is
also positive merit. We might do well to imagine what ways and standards of
living would have been if no nation had been permitted to intervene in the
manner that they did. They would thus be prevented from profiting from their
intervention. If we can imagine such a world, where one country would be
left purely to its own recources and means of utilizing those, with zero
involvement or intervention by any other country, we imagine a world that
has never existed. The fact is that some other country would have entered
into involvement, and then we must speculate upon what kinds of exploitation
that other power might have effected. Would they have been more generous,
and less selfish, than the nation that did in fact involve itself ?  I would
say that any other nation who would have involved would likely have been
harsher, more selfish, more usurious, than what in fact happened. That might
be difficult to imagine, but I think it is quite arguable based on our
observations of the real world.

I would never argue that there is no grounds or need for improvement. To the
contrary. However, I do say that the positive merits, and even the
occassional necessities, short and long term, are habitually ignored by most
who critique.
That is partly because they are engaged in ideological debate.

That military action has secured a nation's interests, and its assets,
abroad, beyond its borders, is an inevitable and necessary "evil" of human
existence. It has been thus throughout human history and it remains thus. Of
course, in most regards Canada's interests are very similar to those of the
United States of America, and I cannot see that Canada would have acted any
differently, in most regards, than the USA has acted, in most situations, if
it had been the larger military power and the USA the lesser of the two
allies. We need only to look to other instances of historical military power
to understand that.

Of course there is another level of meaning. That relates to the very large
personal sacrifices made by wealthy patriots, who have largely made the
black budget programs that have necessarily assured military supremacy
possible. Tax dollars could never have paid for it all. The taxpayers would
have never withstood it. The enemy would have had a hayday turning the
people against their own government. It was by patriotic donation. Black
budgets often are largely by means of patriotic donation and often of
incalculable worth beyond any ledger allusion to them. The rewards too, to
those who participate, are ultimately not monetary, though wealth is secured
in the longer term by the same means, but not only by that means.
Necessarily thus. As for the ledger, in any nation, it does not reveal
reality because any potential or actual hostile foe can read the ledger and
gain some advantage. If that is what is meant by the "racket" then certainly
the camouflage of a legitimate business necessarily conceals the covert
research, development and production of the means of assuring national and
allied defence. Sometimes the best defence is to make the first move. That
is particularly true where the conequences of not doing so would be
disastrous to assets and/or populations.

Does the man at the top of the pecking order beneath him have any friends ?
Yet how often everyone beneath refers to him as valued friend, as they
dream of ways of overthrowing him and usurping his position. Is it any
different amongst nations than it is amongst coworkers who envy every
promotion and side with one another in conspiracies of their own personal
greed ?  Are their rumours for effect, and their secrecy for advantage any
different than those of competing groups of other kinds ? I think you can
derive international politics from your own personal politics, or your
observations of the personal politics of others whom you know quite well.

Not every rich man is a patriot to some larger noble cause, but many a rich
man is exactly that. Then again, many people spend their whole lives
conspiring to spit into, or actually spitting into, the faces of patriots
whose patriotism is to some noble cause or other.

The Li Po lyrics are also available on a wonderful recent recording, 17 Lyrics
of Li Po, on John Zorn's Tzadik label. Stephen Kalm -- I believe he's
performed from time to time with Meredith Monk's ensemble? -- is the intoning
voice, and Ted Mook plays the modified tenor violin.

In the autobiography, Miles Davis has said that he was deliberately rejecting
the symbol of the grinning negro that musicians such as Louis Armstrong
represented to especially white audiences.  In this decade where everything is
upfront, everyone including mad amounts of poets want "star" status and will
stop at nothing to atttain it, it is nice to think about Miles Davis, who by
the way obviously had an enourmous amount of influence on poetry in general,
lay back and do his thing without kissing ass.
 It is sad that so many people would look at Davis's act as some projection of
ego or whatnot, what he was doing was creating his art on his own terms, a
concept this is absent, in an age of buying and selling images and ideas and
"community"

No. Though perhaps that was a rhetorical question. I was not that fortunate.

I presume that you must have some other loyalties. Perhaps  that is a loyalty
to the preservation of your own life and manner of existence. So, perhaps
there is that in common among most, and all that then remains to be said
on that score is: welcome to life, liberty and perhaps some manner
of the pursuit of happiness, in the last days of the 20th century. I often
have reason to question the pursuit of happiness part, or debate the
nature of liberty, but the preservation of lives is beyond question.

We can also be quite assured that the first days of the 21st century
shall inauguarate at century that shall remain free of the constant terror
represented by "duck and cover" drills. Remember those ?

                I've told this story before, but I think not on the list.
Once, when Duncan came to visit, he was on one of his talking jags.  He
arrived, I made coffee, we drank the coffee, etc.  Robert kept talking.
Finally he said, "I am trying to ask you, and if I can stop talking long
enough for you to answer....."

                (And incidentally, some times, for Robert, it was a  stutter,
of the kind I mentioned in a previous post--needing to say several things at
once; some times, it was a way to keep the floor, so the flow would not be
interupted.)

He was ONE of the ones who did this.  There is a line from "ode to Walt
Whitman" that Belitt renders "who loves mankind" instead of "who loves
man," changing homoerotic desire to vaguest philanthropy.

Thanks.  Hayles' in fact sees two schools of chaos theory.  One, found in
Gleick's _Chaos_ book, she calls the "strange attractor" branch--it finds
patterns of oder in the chaotic structures themselves.

The other branch, the "order out of chaos" branch, is more philosophically
oriented.  The major proponent on that "side" is Ilya Prigonine, whose
book _Order out of Chaos_ focuses on the emergence of order from chaotic
systems, rather than the order implicit in the deep structure.  Prigonine
is much harder going for me that Gleick, but the focus in P is on
irreversibility, determinism, and such--philosophically richer.

Olson, yes, he deploys these same notions, interestingly.  My own
interests now are more along the William C Williams line--his sense of
nature in "Spring and All," for example, fits well with the idea of
emergent order arising from disorder.

But what I am really after are contemporary uses of these ideas.  Hayles
locates them very well in fiction (Borges, some Pynchon, a whole
chapter on Doris Lessing; no Burroughs, oddly enough).  But no poetry.
Ashbery would've illustrated several of her ideas very well.  For
example, her sense that Postmodern writers have an ambiguous relationship
to chaos and the ever-increasing amount of information such systems
generate.  Well, that can be found in most of Ashbery's books--several
poems come to mind ("Soonest Mended," with its line about "loose meaning"
for example).

It's sad: any black performer rejecting the symbol of the grinning negro/creating
art on his own terms would be perceived as too big for his pants.  Miles was cool,
though, and no one could deny that.

There's a piece by Tan Lin on Michael Palmer's writing in the _Poetics

"The task before us, then, narrowed itself down to getting Schmidt to
handle 47 tons of pig iron per day AND MAKING HIM GLAD TO DO IT. This
was done as follows. Schmidt was called out from among the gang of
pig-iron handlers and talked to somewhat in this way:
"Schmidt, are you a high-priced man?"
"Vell, I don't know vat you mean."
"Oh yes, you do. What I want to know is whether you are a high-priced
man or not."
"Vell, I don't know vat you mean."
"Oh, come on now, you answer my questions. What I want to find out is
whether you are a high priced man or one of these cheap fellows here.
What I want to find out is whether you want to earn $1.85 a day or
whether you are satisfied with $1.15, just the same as those cheap
fellows are getting."
"Did I vant $1.85 a day? Vas dot a high priced man? Vell, yes, I vas a
high-priced man."
"Oh, you're aggravating me. OF COURSE YOU WANT $1.85 A DAY-EVERY ONE
WANTS IT! You know perfectly well that that has very little to do with
you're being a high-priced man. For goodness sake answer my questions,
and don't waste any more of my time. Now come over here. You see that
pile of pig iron?"
"Yes."
"You see that car?"
"Yes."
"Well if you are a high-priced man, you will load that pig-iron on that
car tomorrow for $1.85. Now do wake up and answer my question. Tell me
whether you are a high-priced man or not."
"Vell-did I got $1.85 for loading dot pig iron on dot car to-morrow?"
"Yes, of course you do, and you get a $1.85 for loading a pile like that
every day right through the year. THAT IS WHAT A HIGH-PRICED MAN DOES,

And so the incentive system was begun. It has been scientifically proven
that giving chocolate bars to workers as an incentive for producing tonnage
is at least as effective, and often results in the breaking of production
records. Think of how much more effective certain kinds of stimulation of
the human central nervous system, the pleasure centers, might prove in terms of
gaining the desired results of longer hours, and more work, for less pay.

We have to recall the scientific fact that chocolate works on brain
chemistry, and so we might have a basis as to why chocolate works better
than money in some instances. So we then can better understand why remote
CNS stimulation would work even better than that, in more people.

Of course the modern warrior must be more immunized than ever before to
being influenced by either pain or pleasure stimulae, including remote
stimulae. Only in that way can the modern warrior remain an effective asset.
Whether such immunization can be adequately achieved without doing
irreparable damage to the warrior's more normative functionning, remains to
be fully understood. The experiments would not only be necessary, but
interesting, as they would reveal a lot about human resiliency and abilities
to adapt and function in new extremes of environment, including the future's
electromagnetic plus psychological warfare battlefields. Any reasonably
sophisticated enemy, will inevitably use EMR and psychological warfare
weaponry in addition to other conventional and non conventional means.

Some feel that we can be ready for those new waves of challenge, or we might
choose to throw poetry barrages at enemy troops.....Perhaps we need a
balance of both, to preserve our humanity more fully. I wonder if there are
any career soldiers who write poetry. I cannot think of any, but perhaps
there are some.

It is commonplace for the true believers in an extremist ideology, as a
group, to hold a belief that other human beings are no longer human. The
demarcation line between us and them is thus more clearly drawn. In fact
this is a characteristic of totalism. Even those who are being made into
members of the group of true believers must first experience what it is like
to no longer be a human being as part of their indoctrination.

This is also true for prisoners of war. It is one of the methods used to
break them. Of course, those troops with access to any sensitive
intelligence must be trained to withstand that same dehumanization. Extremes
of hazing, centering out, and fragging, are one often criticized, but very
effective training tool that helps train special forces personnel. It also
trains intelligence workers.

It is a curious fact that there is at least one extremist group, claiming
Christian affiliation, within North America, that appears to hold the view
that they are the true humans and all those who are non members of that
affiliation will be reduced to zombies. The same distinction between an in
group of true believers and outsiders, where the outsiders are perceived as
less than truly human. Of course there are always extremist groups of
various kinds within any non totalitarian, non totalist, nation. The
safeguards exist to prevent their ever assuming sufficient power to
actualize their aggendas.

To know thyself adequately for the purpose of discerning one's own mind from
other minds, requires knowing what is subjective and what is objective. It
is more complicated than it seems, and a very rare skill, but it is
essential to any instance of a truly effective observer.

Coherence is, of course, not a condition of truth. Apparent coherence can be
the height of illusion.

As for the mechanisms, traditional technology was meant to work materials
into new forms, for new uses, grossly by means of violence. Future
technologies will work on materials in new ways, that emphasize the
rearrangement of the basic "building blocks" of the physical matter that is
being worked. Thus we arrive at the new alchemy. A nanotech of
transmutations that might know no real limits, other than how far our
science has progressed at any given time.

Kent,

Lucy and I interviewed Prigov (informally) a few months back.  I'll
try to scrape some bits of the interview onto the list within the
next few weeks.  If you're interested, I can scan photos of him
standing in front of a wall of wonderful charcoal drawings of his
friends and fellow writers as demons.  He is a visual artist who
earned his living during Soviet times doing sculpture for
children's playgrounds & such, and his house is full of wondrous
objects d'texte.

At least one book-length translation of Prigov's stuff exists (he
showed it to us) but it's not very good.  (He said he can't judge
the English writing, so he just agrees to the translations if he
likes the person.)  A Penguin "New Russian Writing" anthology
(don't have it in front of me) contains good translations of one
Prigov piece and of one Rubenstein piece.  The book's
presentation of Rubenstein is a bit misleading; they give his
"story" as a numbered list, whereas in his books the numbered
story bits are separated by dotted lines & meant to be cut into
cards and spread across the floor, shuffled, scrambled, etc.

If anyone knows of any decent translations (published or
ongoing) of Prigov or Rubenstein, please let me know.

Both are wonderful poets & people, by the way.  After one
meeting, Prigov acted like he was our dad (in the pleasant way
only someone who's not your actual father can do) and
Rubenstein's a tiny, skinny, grinning guy.  I met him after a
reading when he interrupted a discussion of some guy named
Porter to observe: "Porter?  Eto pivo."  Truly a genius.

Prigov will be out of the country until sometime in August...
England, I think.  I'll backchannel his phone number to you as
soon as I remember to bring it in.

Subject: A stutter to the Russians

One of the great "stutterers" in contemporary poetry is Dmitri
Prigov. One example of his genius use of the stutter can be
found in "49th Alphabet Poem," translated by Gerald Janecek
and included in
_Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry_. But to get the full effect,
of course, one has to witness Prigov in performance (and he is
surely one of the great living readers, too). About five years ago,
PBS ran a documentary on the Western market-explosion for
post-Soviet art, and the film included a segment of Prigov
reading one of his "Alphabet" (I believe) poems. Allen Ginsberg
stood beside him, mouth open, as Prigov stuttered and spat
Cyrillic syllables into the microphone, eyes rolling in as if he
were in seizure. When he was done, Ginsberg leaned into the
microphone and said B-B-B-Bravo!.

I've lost contact with Prigov in the past few years, and I'd be
interested in finding out if anyone is currently translating his
work. I know that Lyn Hejinian and Elena Balashova were doing
some translations at one time. It's certainly a shame (unless I've
completely missed it) that there isn't yet a book of his writing in
English.

Actually, this article is quite fascinating....

It declares that Spicer has had virtually no influence since his death.
The author of the article believes that these new books are rescuing an
obscure and forgotten figure from obscurity...

Folks should read this article for some sense of the unimaginable void
between most of academe and what's happening among poets...

Breath-taking...

For those interested in this jazz/stuttering vein, I'd mention Monk,
stuyterer extraordinaire, and more specifically Nate Mackey's work where
Monk and Creeley are implicitly compared along these lines. with the
suggestion that the stutter is an admission of the obduracy of experience,
and that this admission is "the gesture that opens the field" in their
work.  Good stuff.  -m.

Dean et al:

Yes, "the creaking of the word" (from Dogon mythology) is central to
Mackey, as is Legba's limp (from Voudun), and in DISCREPANT ENGAGEMENT he
uses both to come to terms with black music, but also with Wilson Harris,
WCW, Creeley, others (including himself). But this has, of course, been
rehearsed here before...

On Science/Poetics: Fernand Hallyn's THE POETIC STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD,
although it doesn't consider poetry _per se_, does deal interestingly with
the question of _poeisis_ in science and cosmology, and would seem one
place to go if one were pursuing a link between the two (when, for
instance, did the two branches of thought suffer the decisive break from
one another that still lingers today?) But that's not strictly chaos theory
either.

Applying Prigonine's theories to Williams seems appropriate (although I
must admit I've not yet entirely understood Prigonine's books, and have
only really glossed them). It's amazing, tho, how much noise there is in
Paterson  - aural and semantic. And his sense of the falls as muse in P.
would also seem to "fit well with the idea of emergent order arising from
disorder." (This is of course a trope with a large and troubled history,
dating back to Hesiod and his irritably duplicitous muses. "Chaos was born
first and after her came Gaia...," or so the narrative goes.)

Stephen

ps - By way of connecting the two threads mentioned above: I've been
writing a bit around the use of the term "quantum-qualitative" in Mackey's
prose works (Djbot Baghostus's Run, really), which term obviously harkens
back to Heisenbergian uncertainty and the ramifications thereof. Might be
interesting to see what his work would look like read through Hayles' or
Prigonine's lens...

        Susan Howe has pointed out that Oslon remarked of Billy Budd--"the
stutter is the plot" . . .

        Henry James was a well known stammerer--(imagine dictating the
later books to a typist--with a stammer--yet maintaining the sweep of
those majesterial clauses and phrasings--and then hearing them come back
as the sounds of the typewriter--kind of shades of Olson's Projective
verse typewritten compositions??)--
        yet Edith Wharton noted in a memoir that James when reciting
Whitman (his favorite poet) did not stammer--
        so much for the "barbaric yawp"!

Nikuko draws a thread around her arm, just below
The elbow, it's thin, red, it's a division, it's a line.
The leg is marked as well, left arm and leg right,
Staggered dashes that would be parallel and posed.
They are slightly taut, so that the skin swells, lunar,
Around the moon of her taut body, and if kimono
Were wrapped and opened like silk and doubled boxes,
Near sleeves of flowers, like her arm or body.
Between the the threads, a golden twine connects
Clearly to an Alan placed in front of her.
There are flowers, pistils, stamens, across him.
There are stems, thorns, roots and leaves, across him.
The twine is there on or in the Alan.
A breeze strokes the tsuchi sign for earth,
A whisper moves the kire sign for cloth,
Speech appears, the sign of fire, threads its golden
Way across both bone and skin, the sky on fire,
Kimono shuttled on the earth, the cloth on fire,
Threaded Nikuko has closed her eyes, her neck exposed.

>As one last aside, Tipler's statement is almost teleological in the way
>it argues a straight line of improvement past to future.

I missed that particular point.

Definitely false. Tipler, and some other scientists, definitely do not
argue that. They argue for a new teleology that incorporates feedback
loops from future to past as well as normative causalities past to future.

Sarfatti discusses this as "back reaction" on his www pages. Tipler has
also written on similar subject matter, including CTLs (closed temporal loops).

Some intelligences might be more sensitive to feedback from the future than
others. For instance this might explain Leonardo Da Vinci's prodigious
inventions, lacking the materials but incorporating designs we are familiar
with in this century. Jules Vernes uncanny prophecies, similarly. Or even
some of H.G.Wells prognostications. We might even see the mythos of the
Atlanteans as the Atlanteans of our future, rather than our past (where
archeology has in effect failed to find them), manipulating the fabric of
human historical evolution, so that our Atlantean successors can save
themselves from their destruction. And what of Socrates Daemon giving
Socrates his insights the way the Great Gazoo gave insights to Fred
Flintstone.... Perhaps it is the distant future whispering in Socrate's long
ago ear ?  Perhaps some of the shadows of electromagnetic artifact from the
future becomes a part of the cultures of the past, shaping them, though also
mostly by pure chance, and being the cause of many worlds bifurcations of
accelerated cultural evolutions ?
There are indications that that might be happening. That our electromagnetic
garbage might in fact be throwing its wash into the wake of the past, as the
prow of our ship continues at the crest of our temporal wave. Does that mean
that we must be more cautious about our electromagnetic output ?  Perhaps.

That definitely complicates any simple minded traditional teleology.

I like Micheal Moorecock's playful science fiction interpretations best,
as presented in "The Cornelius Chronicles". There, the "many worlds" and
temporal loops take the form of a fictional narrative, and you must note
what years the rock musician, PhD in physics, wrote the original trilogy.

    Don--thanks for thoughts on PER-MISSION....
    so, I'm reading the latest LUNGFULL magazine and finding note
    from ANSELM BERRIGAN on his poem therein included:
    "the poem is an attempt to figure out what might be "permitted"
    to do in 1998, & how not to do that & therefore continue
    (& not intended as a slag on R. Duncan, by the way, but a
     use of his half-line as extension into a field that requires
     some clearing"-------
     (the line by the way is "often i am permitted/ to blow my
      brains out") Now, this may be one of the ways it's possible
      "to draw back from the representations of the Gods to the
       attentions that worshipped them"----
       although perhaps to someone in their 50s this may seem
       too "adolescent", but considering that 1998 may be EVEN
       MORE REPRESSIVE and TOTALITARIAN than 1950s was, maybe
       "adolescent" emotions need to be valorized, or at least
       cathartically, in poetry (so it can still serve some kind
       of safety valve function for suicide urges....)....
      and so I also therefore give permission to Steven ROdefer
      to Heckle Ondaadje (sp?)
       and give Ondaadje permission to donate proceeds to the KSW!
       and maybe somebody will give me permission to indulge my
         LOGORRHEA as Duncan's was indulged.........

the 1990s are repressive as hell hidden under this "freedom to express clause"
in which every college age girl has a neat little tattoo around her ankle
Rebellion is manufactured, Chris    look at the billboard near my sister
Tanya's apartment  on Houston and Thomson street with the "Dalai Lama" under
the caption
"Think different"
or likewise with Miles Davis Yeah, think different but "Buy this product while

I think that if more people knew of the meadow Duncan  was writing about then
the world would be a less anxious place
and by the way   What the hell is holding up a Robert Duncan collected works
including essays and all poems?

For Any List Members In Providence Area:


As you well know, there are few (if any) acceptable readings in Providence (except the Brown Series, which is not open to outside participants).  Until now.


The Apokatastasis Reading Series began last night, and while the crowd was a small one, the quality of the poetry and short fiction presented there was a much needed and refreshing change for this area.


The details are as follows:


Every Tuesday night at 8P.M. at Myopic Books on South Angell Street.


Sign-up for the open reading begins at 7:30.


$2 entry fee includes bottomless cup of coffee (not that Folger's crap, either).  You may also bring your own beer, wine, etc.


5 minute time limit per person for the open reading.


Featured readers receive $30 and read for 35-45 minutes.



For more info., feel free to e-mail me @ Brent_Long@brown.edu

What if permission were not a matter of moral permission--I let you do
that--I give myself permission to do this or that--but a matter of
something much more like mathematical injunction: I discover a certain
possibility and invoke it. "I am permitted to return to a meadow"
certainly has an overtone of being allowed as it were by the gods, but
it is simultaneously  and perhaps more importantly such an injunction.

Also on mythology. The topic is too broadly stated. Mythology can be
used to cut through mythology. Mythology does not stay on a single
level. In one sense, everything is mythology. In another all mythology
is reductive to something else. But within the mythological as a frame
it is possible I think to cut through the co-optation of first order
mythology as well as its reduction, via say psychology, to a familiarly
psycholgocial use.

Wonderful to see Charles Stein post something to the list . . . I may
not have seen his name in print since the "Alchemy" issue of _Io_
magazine! Now all we need is Robert Kelly (and Richard Grossinger? Did I
see HIS name also in the last week?) and we can resurrect the whole
"deep image" school of the early 70s right here in cyber space . . .

But seriously folks, I for one would be very interested in people's
takes on "mythology" circa mid-1998, on whatever level or cutting
abilities it may have.
If I remember some fanciful etymology from Olson's _Muthologos_ we can
even link it to the previous thread on stammering and stuttering . . .
does myth . . . inform people's imaginations anymore? Are there those,
like me, whose deepest sense of education was not exclusively poetics,
but classics? Are Jung, Joe Campbell, "The Truth and Life of Myth" --
obsolete? Representative of the derrier garde? Can "langpo" and "mythpo"
coincide? I'm genuinely curious!

For recent Stein, see his _The Hat Rack Tree: Selected Poems from
theforestforthetrees, 1980-1993_ (Station Hill 1994).

As to mythology, one can recognize and be humbled by the power of the great
irrational forces, even give them names and volition, without subscribing
to the notions of Jung and his spiritual and political disciple Campbell,
who I for one hope are becoming not so much obsolete as historical
artifacts. And one can read and learn from Duncan (I do) without sharing
all of his assumptions.

More troubling to me than their trivialization of the gods is the
trivialization of their passions and fears that my students often exhibit.
I remember talking to a class about eros as an implacable generative and
destructive force and being greeted by titters. It seems that eros in their
minds had been reduced to a particularly pleasurable form of calesthenics.
Of course they were very young. But it seems to me that the culture of the
video game serves that trivialization, which in turn is a defense against
the terror that the novice, standing at the gate, must feel.

Permission, w/respect to the arts, is only an issue if one desires it (or if
one's project requires it) from anyone taking such authority into their hands
as to grant or deny it. The questions then become: (a) why desire that? and/or
(b) what sort of art project is it that requires it to function? And, further
(c) what person or body politic would take such authority into his/her/its
hands?

Chris --

What I said was:

I don't think any of us who argue
that O'Hara had a better-populated mood palette than Gary argued would
argue that it's possible to write like O'Hara -- not only does none of us
have the datebook of an O'Hara, not only are we more restricted in our
permissions (don't ask don't ask!), we have a somewhat different culture
to pick and choose from.

--cut--

This I think says something like what you were saying about 1998 being
somehow more repressive than 1958 (tho less tense than May 68? past
perfect?). No one writes like O'Hara, no one writes like Olson. Why do we
seek the dead among the living? Is it true as they say in this system that
it's easier to get forgiveness than permission?

It's probably bogus, the diachronic study of permission. Power may seem to
be letting you do what you want, go run down the hill into the meadow,
while you're there I'll be upstairs privatising some utilities. I mean,
yes, the permission to teach Benjamin Barthes Baldwin and O'Hara to
first-year comp students, but also the fetter of permanent adjuncthood.

Of course, to be mordantly recursive about it, we could say that the
fetters we wear are the permissions we grant to the regents deacons elders
and trustees to violently paraphrase us in a remade-for-miniseries product
placement binge in which we figure out that we can make it if we replace
ourselves with Junior Mints. My shackle's minty, how's yours?

Or are we the cabbies, finally getting some airtime, looking in the camera
and saying, why can't we work together to solve these problems? and change
the channel and get the major network hijacked by their miniseries's star
into donating two-percent of ad revenue to literacy programs mocking
literacy programs and messing up a bit done right in '82 by Bill Murray.

Finally, though, is subversion approval? Can the permission we give
ourselves subvert the hope that led us to invent it, and can our
intentions throw the prime directive out and intervene at last in the
endless drudgery of our therapies? These questions and many many many more
are answered here, daily, silently, no? no? no?

(don't ask don't ask),
Jordan

Here, for the list's amusement, the Kirkus review of the Spicer biography
as reprinted at amazon.com. Any doubts that there's a culture war going on?
It would be nice to know who the perpetrator was.

From Kirkus Reviews , 05/11/98:
Beat insider Ellingham and novelist Killian (Shy, 1989, etc.) have here
embraced a most resistant, though not unworthy,
subject in poet Jack Spicer. Spicer catalyzed the development of the Beat
Generation in 1950s San Francisco. Though few
literary tales have been told more often (or more tediously) than those
pertaining to the Beats, Spicer's own has been at best ill
served, and at worst wholly ignored, by the prevailing mythologies of the
time. The authors have thus been admirably careful to
keep their focus on the enigmatic Spicer, whose life and verse grew
progressively more estranged, indeed bitterly so, from
those of his more visible peers. In following Spicer's California
odyssey=FEending brutally in San Francisco, where he died from
alcohol-induced liver failure in 1965, aged 40=FEEllingham and Killian tread
too lightly on their subject's more troublesome
personality traits, e.g., his entrenched anti-Semitism and boorish bad will
toward those poets daring enough to court his
approval. This largesse would rankle less, however, had they not chosen to
extend it to the poetry itself, which, while capable
of startling effects and moving lyricism, frequently succumbs to the same
narcissistic bloat that long ago rendered the Beat
temperament clich=82. Instead, the authors have provided, albeit in
impressive detail, a cosmology of poetic egotism, with
Spicer's now the origin. Ultimately, Spicer's legacy, like that of any
devalued artist, must endure the trial of rigorous critical
appraisal. Despite the current academic fashion, literary resurrections of
this sort cannot be taken on faith, but rather require a
proof that the authors, true believers both, fail to supply in this
otherwise well-researched and readable biography. (30 b&w

just to report that brian horihan, an undergraduate advisee of mine whom
some of you know, was awarded a prize for the best summa thesis in the
College of Liberal Arts today at the U of MN.. ...and better yet, in his
thank you speech he talked about hannah weiner.  it thrilled me to have all
these minnesotans hear about hannah, and it thrilled me that brian's
talents were being recognized.

"Progress in our science has over and over again been linked with a
critique of foundations. In the major adavncements, the accumulation of
experience is of little use. One has to ponder the foundations, one must
reflect on the fundamental terms, which is precisely what people like
Einstein or Bohr or Heisenberg did in our century. When, as a young
physicist and a student of Heisenberg's, I myself came upon physics and
tried to study it, it very soon became clear to me that I did not
understand this subject. It was not that I was unable to integrate
differential equations or to discuss with an experimental physicist the
probable results of his experiments. But I did not understand the
concepts with which one tries to express the meaning of these
differential equations. I was naive at first, credulous, as a student
perhaps should be, and I assumed my teachers knew these meanings while I
had not yet advanced far enough to grasp them. As I came to know these
teachers better, and could question them, it turned out that they, too,
including some noted scientists among them, failed to grasp them. To be
sure, they were eminently capable of applying physics and of enriching
it. But, asked to give a strict account of the meaning of their
fundamental terms-matter, energy, causality, prediction, experience,
etc.-they had to admit, especiaaly if they were clear-headed thinkers:
We use these terms simply because they work so well for us. It was
simply to difficult for them to give a genuine account...."
"Where do these concepts come from? Very soon it became apparent that
they normally come not from science but from philosophy...What we called
school philosophy was in part a way of thinking that was rather critical
of modern science. Thus, positivism commended itself. It said: You
scientists are right; hand in hand with you, we combat the fruitless,
useless tradition of school philosophy. But when I tried to fully
understand positivist philosophy, it turned out that it, too, could not
justify its own basic concepts; the concept of experience, for example,
which it presupposed, crumbled when subjected to an increasingly
stringent, self-critical analysis (an analysis practiced, one must hand
it to them, by positivists themselves), until in the end it was very
difficult to say what could be meant by experience at all. In any case,
I concluded that positivist philosophy would not be able to teach me
what modern science is. I then turned to its opponents-in fact, I turned
directly to the greatest one among them, namely Immanuel Kant."---from
The Unity of Nature by Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker

What's the story behind Kirkus reviews?  The Spicer review is
remarkably similar to a hideous sermon I sat through at an
archly conservative wedding last summer (had to remind himself
to say "hey, have a good life" between references to "our
neo-pagan age" as he performed the oh so unpagan catholic
rites of marriage).  And I noticed Kirkus recently when searching
for a Daniel Kharms book... they haughtily dismissed him as
well.

seems to me that the review reflects a certain aesthetic and intellectual
timidity disguised as authoritarian curmudgeonliness.  this nonsense about
"time will tell" if spicer's a good writer or not indicates that the
reviewer is incapable of understanding literature that has not been
predigested and either canonized or cast aside, and he feels uncomfortable
making any evaluation in the review, since it's clear that he himself has
never read spicer's work, and has almost certainly never sat in a class
where a teacher told him what to think about spicer.

These are some further notes on the mythology thing going round.And a
bit more on my remark yesterday about "permission" and mathematics.

Consider a poetics of the many colors of unknowing--what the issues
would be.

A gnosis or (a-)gnosis: a knowing that subsists in every conscious
moment of unknowing; a knowing not of being, if being is limited to the
existent, the determinate; but an (a-)gnosis of being itself if, rather,
being were the enigmatic issuance of whatever comes to seem to be: to
install oneself in that (a-)gnosis of the issuance and to COMPOSE from
the emergent.

The "Poetics of this situation" would involve a species of emergent
mythology: tale fragments, images, traces, gestures, charades,
stammerings--messages of and from that which decays into its own
manifestations but yet haunts them, rides, them, imbues them, taunts
with feignts and lurings, blasts and pronunciamentos, picking up the
shards of whatever mythemes, (a-)theologemes, (anti-)ideologemes seem to
stand in the path.

By the mathematical sense of permission I mentioned yesterday I meant
this:

Let X= a + b. This "letting" is an injunction, a command to initiate an
engagement of the mind. It has the advantage of being trackable.You can
see the act by which what follows was enjoined. Now in poetry, a
mythologeme can be enjoined in a similar manner. An association may be
declared, brought, through the act of the poem, into the arena of
possible thought or intention. This is not to enforce an assertion by
priviledged reference but to open what is possible to be entertained or
entered into. To me, the usefulness of Duncan's legacy has more to do
with such acts of mythology than any general valorization of the
mythological as such.

A day or so ago I snapped at the recent article in Lingua Franca.  While
the author of that piece was a. not anonymous;  and b. fairly bright;
nonetheless there are overlaps with the poor dunderhead in Kirkus....

They both assume, because of their own ignorance, that Spicer is
unimportant and unknown.  Their familiarity with the contemporary poetry
scene is (to put it kindly) minimal.

Both these articles bring into high relief, the gap between a large part
of academe and the world of working poets.  Admittedly the Kirkus writer
is exceptionally stupid and remarkably arrogant for such an inept and
ill-informed reviewer.  Even so, his/her attitude (and ignorance) are
representative.  The idea that a poet as influential as Spicer needs to be
"resurrected" is a striking common thread present in both these academic
articles.

OK, these writers are ill-equipped to deal with their subject; and in the
Kirkus case, pretty clearly unqualified to deal with poetry at all.  (One
of the most succint and least self-involved of all significant 20th
century poets....And what does this genius dismiss him as? "Narcissistic
bloat"..The idea does occur, that the Kirkus piece is too stupid to be
real; can it be that this is all a parody?)  But the real message is not
the inadequacies of certain reviewers.  That they could imagine Spicer is
of no import, and that responsible editors would print that claim, are
indications of the chasm between much of the academic world, and the world
of actual contemporary poets...

I presume because unknowing, as a deconstructive movement towards knowing
nothing, is to be considered safer, in a DADAistic kind of way, than is any
movement towards more definite and ground breaking understanding ?

Many do feel that way. They are encouraged to feel that way.

The same strand of thinking pervades the recent trend to deconstruct any
musical and lyrical materials (therefore poetic materials), via
technological devices, such that the artifacts that are produced by
complexes of intentionality and chance elements create new non meanings. The
non meanings, or unknowings of the original artistic intentions and content,
becoming the work of art, or work of new performance. This is at the very
core of "techno", and resembles "techno shamanism" as to its apparent
implications of meanings. Though "techno" also becomes the protest against
the substance of its roots and origins. DADA served a similar function
within the larger political situatedness. (Do we ever learn from such
concatenations of poetic and political events ?)

Is a future poetics to be more DADA, and deconstructive, than it is to be
anything else ?  Is that the ideologically influenced tendency ?  The
tendency to say less and less with more and more sounds ?  More and more
sounds becoming a kind of poetic silence, comprised from a potentially
infinite number of poetic voices ?  Ah, an "angelic" chorus.... that
ultimately reveals nothing new, in all its presages of infinite newness, and
making the old new again,.... Not so "angelic" after all. No more angelic as
an instantiation of any "heavenly host" than martial music and goose
stepping troops in precise military formations.....There is in fact a
connection between the two (radical deconstruction and military challenge).

Gnostics are the keepers of secret knowledge. They claim to safeguard true
knowledge, available only to initiates. You could argue that for something
radically new to be learned, something must first be unlearned that
conflicts with that new knowledge. That, of course, is not always true.
Sometimes the new knowledge is simply added to what else was already known.

What that has to do with the craft of writing poetry, remains at best obscure.
Perhaps you can elaborate further....to clarify what you are saying.

The motions become theatre. There is, of course, a grey area, between
performance of poetry and thespian performance. There is no clear dividing line.
The poem can be a one act play. Can it also be a charade or mime ?  Then the
poetry is the silence, and the theatre is the gesture.

>By the mathematical sense of permission.....

Mythematics in poetics.....(After all, mathematics is ultimately another
language, same as the language of poetry is another language, for the
creation of myths. Both kinds of myths are potentially explanatory,
predictive, useful, if they happen to say something that is "true" about the
world.)

Creating an infinite set of possible values for all three variables.
Poetry is in fact more precise and limited as to its meaningful arrangements.

Are you talking about the musical (genre) Techno as in the cousin to Detroit
House music?

If so, what about Africa Bambatta (sp?) in the Bronx in the 70s breating beats
to Kraftwerk the freakish German Techno/Dada music group which sounded like
robots and planes taking off-
Hip-Hop music and its wide variety of sampling is very (postmodern) I hate
that term (except when Olson uses it) and seems at its core to break the idea
of creating new-
Look at Puff Daddy winner of grammy's etc/ in hip-hop he adds nothing new to
the
situation- all he does is pre-program hits by Bowie , The Police etc and re-
represent them-People don't care- originality, as in the Apple campaign means
"fitting in, and creating trends)
see Craig Mack in his 1994 video "Flavor in Your Ear) in which he wears a
hockey jersey-that summer in Buffalo every kid on the corner had the same
hockey jersey-"think different buy apple fit in)


Is our culture mimicing technology by moving in circles and borrowing "retro"
styles and bringing things back from the 70s (such as Kraftwerk and disco
culture)
or are we standing still?

Danny, in my experience these kinds of assumptions are frequent and can be
extremely harmful. Once, according to a local grant panelist I knew, a Chax
appeal for funds was nearly shot down (and the amount finally awarded
considerably reduced) because one panelist, who is an honored professor at
the local university, basically came in with the attitude that authors Chax
was printing or presenting weren't any writers he knew about, therefore
they must not be anybody important. As I recall, this was a time when those
authors probably included Nate Mackey and Norman Fischer, among others.

But it gets worse. I know of one case of a local, fairly rural arts council
denying a literary press funding because the panel in that locality didn't
consider literature to be art.

And we wonder why it is so difficult for poets to get published . . .

I'll try, at this moment, to answer quesetion about what this has to
poetics.

These steps. A state of unknowing, a suspension of the cognitive,
wherein the cognitive as such, knowing as such, remains the modality,
the way of holding oneself, etc. Not so much a cloud of unknowing, but a
suspension of assertoric grasping. Yet the discovery that you might call
it the will-to-know remains. Staying with that. And persuing the
discovery. Poetic utterance, mythic material, emregent possibilities of
discourse, to get it out, to get it said, what sits on the edge of what
can be said,--not an abandonment of articulation, but articulation at
the liminal edge of knowing. That this is a source of creative
involvement. That it is for me, anyway. That its relevance is parallel
various techno-issues but not identical with them (George Quasha and I
have written three monographs and a series of articles on the
Video-poetics of Gary Hill, the video-installation artist, which try to
dope out some of these issues--I'll post references to them when I get a
minute.) Such a state could, metaphorically be linked to shamanic
states, but I don't particularly favor the valorization of poetics by
REFERENCE to the shamanic. The point is not to call it shamanic. But
what might that be about if you try it? What do you find out it impells?

As to its infinite potentiality, its infinite chorus. Well, perhaps. But
in practice it's a matter of what concretely emerges, and what one is
able to compose with what does emerge. I don't propose some sort of
method, value the method, and validate examples of its use. I was
raising this business, just to throw another angle on what a possible
use of the mythological might look like, to complicate the discussion.
And see if something other than the leap to the most universal
level--like what we all ought to be doing or allowing--could sound like.

Gnosticism. Seems pretty much up for grabs these days. Certainly after
Harold Bloom's book. And I entertain that language, for myself, because
I do find myself engaged in reading Nag Hammadi texts, say, with a lot
of interest, and do want to keep open this possibility: that there is an
important sense of knowing that arises at the intutive interface of
language and mind; that it is what used to be the source of mytho-poetic
authority, but NOW does not need any longer to exert such
authority--that there is another possibility inherent in its practice.
And the crucial point is not to get hung up on the idea that something
is validated because its called mythological or shamanistic or
gnostical. But the word still might point to somthing interesting.

charles b is a prof, susan howe is a prof, nate mackey is a prof, mark
scroggins is a prof, mark nowak is a prof, etc etc etc.  it's pretty clear

Oh, I don't know.  I think the humanities are full of "scholars" with
such faith in the winnowings of history.  Whether they'd actually _say_
it is another thing, but I think plenty of them _believe_ it.

I agree that the Kirkus "time will tell" review was more an arrogant put-down
than a review.  But history is not a mechanical winnowing process - there
are readers involved.  And it's not just a political canon-making job.
There was an interesting article in the NYorker about a year ago on the
ups and downs of Willa Cather's critical reception & reputation; the point
being that readers keep going back to her no matter what evolves & revolves
in litcritical politics.  So I think what I'm saying is: if you count in
readership over time, then you can't just dismiss the "time will tell" issue
out of hand. [I'm a closet reader of "classics" - have been ever since
the comic book series.]  - Henry Gould

=B6  bravo, mark maria mark henry and dan -

        the Legitimation factor (nostalgia for an
        academe as 'arbitor of culture') is running
        pretty high in thse reviews. 'naturally', there's
        some clause in there about readership over
        time or something, but I think maria's read
        is accurate in the case of the kirkus thing,
        viz., this guy doesn't know his ass from an
        apple unless the difference has been handed
        down by generations of esteemed professors.
        (note: read diacritic in "esteem-ed" for special
        high-comic effect).

Anyway, I don't think JS has been doing too badly in the
readership dept. - outside of the English Dept. (of the spirit),
that is. I'm not sure in "the trial of rigorous critical appraisal"
he doesn't end up sentencing judge, prosecution, and defense.

        sort of funny, too, that he's now a genuIne Beat poet,
        just by virtue of having been writing in SFCA at the
        time - purely circumstantial evidence, if you ask me.

The "classic" bit is complicated by the fact that Willa Cather consciously
worked for it.  She was expert in Latin, loved Virgil, & aimed for a
"classic" restraint, clarity & proportion - like Frost - another
anomaly in the canon -

"The great success which attends reason in its mathematical employment
quite naturally gives rise to the expectation that it, or at any rate
its method, will have the same success in other fields as in that of
quantity. For this method has the advantage of being able to realise all
its concepts in intuitions, which it can provide a priori, and by which
it becomes, so to speak, master of nature; whereas pure philosophy is
all at sea when it seeks through a priori discursive concepts to obtain
insight in regard to the natural world, being unable to intuit a priori
(and thereby to confirm) their reality. Nor does there seem to be, on
the part of the experts in mathematics, any lack of self-confidence as
to this procedure-or on the part of the vulgar of great expectations
from their skill-should they apply themselves to carry out their
project. For, since they have hardly ever attempted to philosophise in
regard to their mathematics (a hard task!), the specific difference
between the two employments of reason has never so much as occurred to
them. Current empirical rules, which they borrow from ordinary
consciousness, they treat as being axiomatic. In the question as to the
source of the concepts of space and time they are not in the least
interested, although it is precisely with these concepts (as the
original quanta) that they are themselves occupied. Similarly, they
think it unnecessary to investigate the origin of the pure concepts of
understanding and in so doing to determine the extent of their validity;
they care only to make use of them. In all this they are entirely in the
right, provided only they do not overstep the proper limits, that is,
the limits of the natural world. But, unconsciously, they pass from the
field of sensibility to the precarious ground of pure and even
transcendental concepts, a ground (instabilis tellus, inabilis unda)
that permits them neither to stand nor to swim, and where their hasty
tracks are soon obliterated. In mathematics, on the other hand, their
passage gives rise to broad highway, which the latest posterity may
tread with confidence."
"...It therefore becomes necessary to cut away the last anchor of these
fantastic hopes, that is to show that the pursuit of the mathematical
method cannot be of the least advantage in this kind of knowledge
(unless it be in exhibiting more plainly the limitations of the method);
and that mathematics and philosophy, although in natural science they
do, indeed, go hand in hand, are none the less so completely different,
that the procedure of one can never be imitated by the other."---from
The Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant---cp

Subject:      Vs. Spicer
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi everyone it's Kevin Killian.  Naturally interested in the discussion
around Spicer.  And very thrilled because the people from Wesleyan sent me
an advance copy of the book the other day . . . so I can carry it around on
buses, etc., make people want to read it.  They say it will be in the
stores in 2 weeks.  (This book, for list members who are curious, is "Poet
Be Like God: Jack Spicer and the San Francisco Renaissance," by me and
Lewis Ellingham.)

Anyway, yes, it is disheartening that Kirkus Reviews printed the paragraph
it did--even more so that Amazon.com features this review right under the
part where it says, "Find out more about this book"!  There's an equally
dismissive review in "Library Journal," which covers not only my book but
Peter Gizzi's edition of Spicer's lectures "The House that Jack Built"
(also from Wesleyan), noting that Lew, Peter and I all live in California
and *that's* why we are working under the assumption of Spicer's worth when
he's so unpleasant.  This review was signed, by David Kirby, Florida State
University, Tallahasse, and I'd appreciate directions to his house if
anyone has them.  To send him ninjas, etc. under cover of the great Florida
night.

However Publishers Weekly printed a great review, written by a young New
York poet (of genius)--my new best friend--a man with astute vision and
discernment--a man I plan to marry within the next few months . . . just
kidding . . . but only a little . . .

What are you going to do?  These reviews are indeed based, as Maria has
said, on the aversion of the reviewers to something new, and they find it
preposterous that a man they have never heard of is having whole books
written about him.  This shaking up of the canon is kind of discomfiting, I
suppose.  Wesleyan could have published a life of John Berryman instead,
but no, they are gambling, perhaps, on Jack Spicer.

The man of the hour.  I appreciated the Lingua Franca article "Radiohead"
much more than did Mark Prejsnar . . .  The writer, John Palatella, had to
address a general intellectual audience, perhaps one largely unfamiliar
with poetry, and he did a bang up job IMHO.  Always I've wanted to appear
in "Lingua Franca," but, not being in the academy saw little chance of it,
having no students to harass, etc.

Jumping on band wagon, "Grand Street" will be printing two of the newly
discovered Spicer poems in their next issue to appear momentarily.  So
that's good news.

I am so happy that the biography is finally on the verge of appearing.
Over the years I've bugged everyone on the list asking for help of one kind
or another, and so many of you came through for me, and therefore let me
thank all of you for your kindness and forebearance and aid.  Even those of
you who never post any more, be happy for me, XXX Kevin K.

Apparently this has been going on for years. I remember that in the 60s it
was pretty well a given in Canada that the important current US poets were
like Olson, Creeley, Levertov, Spicer, Duncan. But then we would find out
that in the US universities these people were either unknown or thought to
be marginal. I wd hear of US academics who thought US poetry was a bunch of
other people I had barely heard of, like Merwin and so on.

I'm not a professor, but I've been bloated in my time.

Michael Coffey, who last I heard was still a list member here, works (or
worked) for either Kirkus or Publishers Weekly. If the former, maybe he
would have some insight into that bit of silliness. My own take is that the
whole piece reflects a pretty common reviewer's anxiety about his/her role -
- exacerbated by the fact that they know they don't understand the work --
which they try to resolve by writing as though "above" the subject.

As to the dismissal of Spicer, the book itself recounts the reaction of
Ferlinghetti in like mind. People who don't pay attention to poetry really
have no idea what these fault lines are. I can parody Creeley, say, in a
company newsletter ("If you were going to join the 'net, what kind of PC
would you get?") and no one will ever catch the reference. Think of how your
parents and grandparents must have thought of Stein.

Speaking of which, good to see her boy Charles on the list again!

at Teachers & Writers Collaborative, 5 Union Square West.

Speaking of PW, its review of Smokes opens: "Often a dance of malapropism,
jarring surrealist and pop imagery, violent pastiche and merciless non
sequiturs, Wheeler's second book falls somewhere between John Ashbery and
Charles Bernstein in its high-end schtick appropriation and baroque,
metaphysical strains."  Apologies to both!

I did a brief search to answer my own question about  these
Kirkus folks.  From their own information, how they ever decided
to review Spicer & Kharms is a mystery.  Also, it's not clear how
"professorial" they are; they seem to be simply in the business of
generating large quantities of reviews.  Kirkus excerpts appear
on the web pages of several mass-market publishers and on
lots 'o personal "this is my book" web pages.  They are always
listed as "Kirkus Reviews," with no author named.

For the curious few, I've attached a sample of what my search
turned up.  #1 below looks like a student response to the
glorious folks at K with interesting echoes of the list's
responses.  #2 is promotional info about K from a web page (not
their own; apparently they have no web page & someone with a
related name got so many misdirected hits they posted basic
Kirkus info in an attempt to turn away queries). #3 is a sample
Kirkus review which is different from the two we've discussed, yet
too bizarre to pass over.

How about "The Poetics List Reviews" submissions to places
like Amazon (which offers the--presumably heavily
moderated--option to review books yourself)?

The second review of In the Lake of the Woods does not do the
book justice. I would like to know who wrote that review. I'm not
saying I know any more about post-modernism than what we
studied in class, and I can see the elements in the book. A
person writing book reviews, I'm assuming, should know
something about it. The reviewer simply chops the book down to
the bare essentials, and then claims that there is nothing
underneath. I think whoever wrote this needs to take our class
and then read it again.

Kirkus Reviews accepts approximately 5,000 new fiction,
nonfiction, and children's titles, both hardcover and
trade-paperback, each year for review. However, many
thousands more are submitted that are not reviewed. The
editors make these individual judgments based on many
separate factors, including merit or potential interest.

The editors at Kirkus Reviews will consider any new fiction,
nonfiction, or children's title for review in galley or other form. All
submissions must be received in duplicate at least three
months, preferably longer, before publication date.

Kirkus Reviews does not review the following:

     self-published books
     mass-market books
     textbooks
     specialized, technical or professional works.

Kirkus Reviews very rarely reviews the following:

     reprints
     picture-albums
     books of lists
     compendiums of information (travel guides, etc.)
     instructional manuals
     self-help books
     academic works directed chiefly to an academic audience

Folks should check out the new mag, Kenning. The first issue is very
impressive...Nine poets and every one's worth paying attention to.  Mark
Wallace has 3 very acrid, spiky poems, which are in large part different
from other work of his I've seen (tho' there are points of comparison).
Since his various projects in chapbooks and mags all seem rather different
from each other, but all urgent...It's very impressive folks.  Juliana
Spahr has something neat, language working out its own partial critique
of itself (the strategy of her book Response).  My fellow @lantan John
Lowther has what I consider one of his best things, which builds a
musically-driven counter-narrative around fragments of Proust.

But my favorite, or at least the newest and most piquant, are the
word-square acrostic-derivation procedural sonnets by Dan Zimmerman.
(Believe me, it would take too long: get the issue and see 'em)

Editor Durgin has a meditation on poetix which is worth reading, and the
graphic on the cover (neo 1917 parasoviet futurism) is really neat.

Things by John Kinsella and Stephen Ellis (whose blockish circumpolitical
meditational poems almost bog down in their playfully lugubrious diction,
but don't; and make an important foil for Wallce's existential
alienational leftism...) ..those are also top notch.

And all the poets I haven't mentioned are above the norm.

As someone who's been doing this sort of thing for a while now I think
this one is starting off brilliantly.

If these reviewers/writers don't know about Spicer it may be that they
'know' what little of contamporary poetry they know through such
anthologies as the regular Norton, where Spicer is non-existant. If such
anthologies create the canon as 'the' academy knows it (after all some of
us who admire & love Spicer are in 'some' academy, neh?), then their
ignorance of his work & his influence is not hard to understand.
I seem to remember some comments about how difficult it is to put Spicer in
any anthology awhile back, but one of the shorter serial poems, something
like _A Red Wheelbarrow_, or one of the series from _A Book of Magazine
Verse_, or ne of the 'books' from _The Holy Grail_ would at least give
something of his work's flavour...
Not that anthologies are the best teaching tool, but they sure are the
major one, & Spicer's absence in the ones most used helps explain such
comments as have been reproduced here recently...

I've been reading Jonathan Brannen's The Glass Man Left Waltzing, which is
a little recent chapbook from Meow Press.  I recommend that people check
it out. It's a single long poem "occasioned by the centenial of Whitman's
death."  WW is bigness and broad gestures, for better and for worse.
(Also somewhat small ones sometimes, that's what a lot of people
miss...But the first point stands)  I'd say Brennan's words try to
encompass that largeness and breadth by wrapping around it...by twisting
and turning.  As physical movement and phrasal turn, the best descriptor
for the verse might be, loosened-up Zukofsky.  Very shiftingly, like
refections in water (a haunting image thru-out the poem) sections and
riffs glance off walt's obsessive themes: the sensual body, death, sex,
war's violence. Interesting spiral of the verse.

after roaming many pavements
     in some deep recesses
         far from the clank intervals
   grazing the hirsute stars
time compacts mystery
    and modern reports
      this is life
       come to the surface
    underfoot overhead sun



A very adroit & gripping poem.  Worth seeing.

All of that then becomes another small part of the sonic jungle, where the
deconstruction and destruction of sense of meaning becomes normative.

What is important is that the "work of art" is an essentially disassociative
scramble of what is essentially a concatenation of ideas from someone else's
minds. It is not a "new creation" but a violent deconstruction of previous
creations that were created by others. That becomes the essence of it.

Keep in mind also that we live on a planet where a large portion of its
inhabitants despises every element of our artistic culture, and particularly
the lyrics of our music. They have technology also. They are not cave dwellers.

So, I sometimes wonder if we are at war.....in a new sense of that.

Any fragment can be made into a circle.

Is technology mimicking culture, but according to its own designs ?

That would be a better question.

I think I made that pretty clear by stating that current artists are sampling

wouldn't it be easier to just say "borrowing"?

To say that a large portion of earth' s inhabitant's despises "every element
of our artistic culture" to to presuppose that "our" means art as you see it,
I see "They" as a classic "duality" situation an (us vs them mentality-)
as far as people on this planet despising art, "they" probably should,  as it
as defined  as "our artistic culture" shouldn't matter to anyone outside the
"local community-"


Who are "They who have technology and are not cave dwellers"
I am not following how this had anything  to do with my reference to Puff
Daddy and sampling...


So, I sometimes wonder if we are at war.....in a new sense of that.

Was Spicer antisemitic? This comes as news to me. I would like to think
the Kirkus review (which I  have not seen) is a parody but it probably
isn't.

For those interested in recent Spanish poetry--my article entitled "How to
be Great: Canonical Strategies in Recent Spanish Poetry" is out in
_Revista de Estudios Hispanicos_ (May 1998). I argue that poets can get
famous fast by ably imitating already canonical styles. It isn't a full
fledged scholarly article, just a relatively breezy MLA talk.

Use of Hitler in Thai snack advertisement slammed


            BANGKOK, May 29 (Reuters) - Israeli embassy officials on
Friday said the use of German tyrant Adolf Hitler in an
advertising campaign for potato crisps in Thailand was
``disgusting.''
            The campaign on local Thai television shows Hitler in
military uniform tasting the crisps and giving the Nazi salute.
The ad ends with Hitler in front of a Nazi flag as the swastika
changes into the logo of the crisp brand.
            ``I think that the advertisement is in some ways disgusting,
it's not something you laugh at. I don't laugh at it even though
it is making fun of him,'' said an spokeswoman at the Israeli
embassy in Bangkok.
            She said the matter was being brought to the attention of
senior Israeli diplomats but that they had not yet seen the
two-week-old ad.

            The local arm of international advertising agency Leo
Burnett Worldwide Inc, which created the ad, said it was
designed to be humorous.
            ``We have brought up the concept that Hitler or anyone who
tastes the potato chips will go crazy for it,'' said a company
spokesperson.
            The advertising campaign was also being run in poster form
around the capital city Bangkok, including on the backs of the
city's trademark motorised rickshaws or ``Tuk Tuk.''

     Having read some pretty strong endorsements of Rochelle Owens' work,
     particularly that it is very "raw" and "wild," I queried the List to
     see if anyone could recommend a representative text to me. I received a
     number of generous responses (thanks to all) and purchased her New and
     Selected Poems from Junction/Mark Weiss. Mark was very helpful and I am
     very grateful to him. However, I do not find Owens' work to be
     particularly "wild" (though some was sexually explicit) and seriously
     disagree with the hyperbolic blurbs on the book jacket. I admire Owens'
     poetry but find it pretty tame in terms of form and content. To me,
     "wild" is Chris Alexander's n/formation
     (http://choengmon.lib.utah.edu/~calexand/nonce/nonce.html), Mark
     Peters' wonderful new site, Deluxe Rubber Chicken
     (http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/deluxe/), or the recent amazing
     posts by Alan Myouka Sondheim such as NAKED ALAN AND NIKUKO NAKED COPY
     AND RUN AROUND SOME FILES. This is only my opinion and I am not saying
     that Owens' work was not "wild" at one time or that the opinions of
     others on this List aren't valid. I'm saying that challenging,
     innovative work is all over the place, including this List, and I don't
     see much discussion of it somewhere that's supposed to be devoted to
     it. Almost no one has commented in any way (including me - I wrote to
     him backchannel) to/about the Sondheim posts. That's very discouraging.
     I'm hoping that this post will encourage people to engage in some
     dialog about the new work that gets ignored because it doesn't conform
     to an older definition of avant-garde work, one that is increasingly
     codified and canonized. Thanks.

"Epistemology aims, of course, at intersubjective and, if possible,
objective knowledge. But if knowledge of the self, in an objective
sense, is impossible, then epistemology as an objective science would be
impaired. The concept of objective self-knowledge would be
self-contradictory, inconsistent, a vicious circle.
This argument was put forth by Kant. He maintained, for instance, that
"I cannot obtain the least representation of a thinking being by means
of external experience, but solely through self-consciousness." This
might have been true in Kant's time. Until recently, knowledge of the
self was possible only through introspection. But, in the meantime, we
have developed cognitive technologies which free the study of self from
subjectivism. Psychology, neurobiology, artificial intelligence provide
insights into the workings of the self. Although this will remain
extremely difficult and although we might never get the information we
want, the study of the self has been objectified."---from On Supposed
Circularities in an Empirically Oriented Epistemology by Gerhard
Vollmer---cp

ah he showed such promise as a youth Mr. B but then along came tenure and
he turned into a broody hen now he thinks he is the goose that laid these
golden eggs. once you obsess about intellectual property and unused the
intellect fades and the hold on the property becomes a death grip, give
them up Mr. B, let someone with intellect, credibility and desire get them
out, withholding these
teachings should be an indictable offense, my advice  the thirsty in the
desert is to transcribe the tapes, they almost always taped his talks often
impromptu theme raps, i remember a long riff about mothers day at...  maybe
i'll go get that one he probably transcribed all his lectures at Santa Cruz
but maybe they've got tapes, George Butterick might have made tapes of
Duncan teaching Pound, Chuck Stein might know if those exist at Storrs
and give your children that medicine and they will be well heeled, nearly
wheeld, My understanding, i'm no lawyer, but i've always proceeded from the
idea that if you're not making a profit from it it's not breaking the
copyright of course if you give away enough copies you could saturate the
miniscule market, but hoarding Duncan as an academic relic you deprive him
of his rightful prominence as a gay culture hero, we're talking bout the
american goethe, the american rumi( i prefer to think of Blaser as the
canadian rumi) and this hoarding in a boomerang hurts the estate of HD for
example if i were hd's publisher i'd sue mr. b for alienation of
affections, thousands of he-men will be scurrying to hilda's work once the
hd book is generally available do you believe your poetry should be read or
do you beleaf your poetry should make you money, sing your poems? write

belief includes the gospel according to Thomas where Jesus says from the
middle of the round dance,"those who have not entered the dance have

nickel. duncan said he didn't need to take drugs he looked out the window
and their were faces in the trees without them what more did he want? one

everyone else i like to remember when bob marley was reading jack spicer,
jim morrison had passed it on, heads of the town on to jimmy cliff who
couldn't make hide nor hair of it and passed it on to reggae history,
spicer's story could be filmed in noire mcclure climbing in th window and
stealing billy the kid right from jack's stupourous dream fully clothed on
the couch radio blaring, the renaissance never ended for jocko he ran a
court he consorted with others who ran courts some overlapping they shared
a love for the classics, the current enactment of the myth which they lived
through dionysus or crass bacchus tubby bacchus, latin, greek, language,
dante,lyric pound,epic pound, stevens, josephine miles, creeley,ginsberg,
like blackburn troubadour courts, trobar clus,

peter,

yr post strikes a chord with me, as a long while back i voiced a similar
observation on alan's work, which blips thru these screens quite regularly
so as to become paradoxically commonplace and yet remain extraordinary
each time. (there's a coupla books worth of his stuff sitting in the list
archives, some of which chris alexander nicely brought out in chap form.)
the lack of response is in part the nature of the beast(s), namely one,
the volume of daily list traffic, and two, the kind of engagement that
anything other than a superfluous response to his work demands.

just last week someone posted a few poems by jeff clark, and having just
finished that book i cast my line into the waters with a few tentative
takes on the work, with nary a nibble in response.

dont think people are disinclined to discuss new (or old!) work here, all
depends on time/energy/will to engage i guess.  surely one reason to stay
tuned in is to keep up with all the work that's circulating out there...

Hi.  I'm not sure what the protocol is.  But I feel that I'm evesdropping
-  & perhaps saying "Hullo" will make me feel as tho I'm in the same room
as everyone else, even if I'm doing less talking.  That is, I ASSUME I'll
be doing less talking, as its a US Poets list & I'm an Australian poet.  My
name's Ken Bolton.  I publish a magazine, Otis Rush (hence my email
address) & Little Esther Books.  The Otis Rush website is at
http://www.eaf.asn.au/otisrush,html should anyone be curious.

Having said Hullo I should add "don't mind me" & sign off.

Hullo! (If that's how you spell it down there.) As far as I can tell, this

I'm finding the recent discussion of "permission" most engaging, from one
to another senses, including the mathematical, and all manner of
possibility coming out of Duncan's "Often I am permitted . . . "

So, though I would share the following, from a collaborative work in
progress by Sheila Murphy and me.


row it through the reflection
and sew no things together
(hear, syllables, juxtapose)

emphatically, we do not
know what we are
doing here, and

we set up goal posts anyway
and void our promised histories
we can not share, or ask

or even choose which pro-
noun wakes us up in the
dream, where we have permission

Especially the "Blownotes Section" of Clarks book is interesting, He also
explores the narrative in a challenging weird way - You are right about
discussing current work
How about the new Creeley book, I picked it up and was amazed that the new
work, especially "Dogs of Auckland" (yes i understand it was a chapbook first)
is incredible-  I have no lines to quote the only problem is that at 17.95 i
cant buy it -Creeley is in master form!
New Directions may have a good idea printing hardcovers but for me 17.95 is
a lot for a paperback that is going to cost 7.95 in a year -at any rate it is
worth
the 17 dollars now at any rate
Also What is up with Berthoff, is he preparing a manuscript of Duncan's work
This is not fair when most libraries (SUNY Albany has a pretty good selection
of small press poetry no doubt because of Don Byrd)
But if you can  not get a hold of most of Duncan's work for example "Ground
Work"
then it will hurt scholarship in that area-
I get the feeling there are some games being played concerning this
enlighten me folks, who is responsible?

Like Maria, I have posted my admiration for Alan's poetry to the List more
than once. But true, not for a while, and I regret being remiss. The recent
poems were, as usually, amazing.  I suppose I didnt want to make a habit of
response or even more so, of positive response--didnt want it to look
kneejerk. But I do find him a true trailblazer, I havent seen other work
that incorporates this medium, cyberspace, as tellingly, that brings it and
the tradition together so brilliantly. The strangeness that I am not alone
in wanting from poetry is never easy to come by. I find it in Alan's
writing and am extremeley grateful to him.

Thank you, Nada "Ume" Gordon, for this informed, articulate, and deeply
felt response to Alan's work. While not having the context for it which you
have, I too have had more of an 'appreciation' with an underlying
discomfort at its  'exoticizing.'

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

With all due respect--and I say this as no empty phrase--for the opinions
of Nada Gordon and my friend Charles Alexander,that Alan Sondheim's poems
render me uncomfortable is part of what I prize in them.
   Gertrude Stein's 'fetishizing' of the language I found acutely
uncomfortable, for years of learning. Robert Creeley's poetry, with its
'fetishizing' of the uncomfortable aspects of women, and of his male rage
so confronted, "For love I would/split open your head and put/ a candle in/
behind the eyes," was also hard to take--arresting, I'd say. For years and
years.
   The listing--surely what is being termed fetishizing in this debate--of
a young sex object's body parts in a poem of Robert Duncan's, "The Torso",
was equally a challenge to admit. In this vein, there are poems by Ginsberg
that chafed, chafe. I suppose if there were neon signs in my neighborhood
offering anal penetration with broom-handles, I might deplore the possible
social consequences of his poem "Dear Master."
   To me, anything people do, or fantasize doing, is material for a poem,
even while in another sense it is immaterial to a poem. What is telling is
the intensity, the involvement and detachment, the ratios and timings, with
which it is done. "Bombs opening like flowers"--who can forget that?**
Because I was nearly killed during The Blitz takes nothing away from that
image. Political rectitute would be the death of poetry. That said, of
course one is allowed whatever response or reaction s/he has to a poem. I
speak up here today only because I would find "uncomfortable" a chilling
grounds for the dismissal of a poem, and hope Charles and Nada may find it
operates for them as an entrance to, rather than an exit from, Alan's work.

David


** although I may have forgotten the precise wording. "Exploding"? I
believe it is from a poem by Gabriel D'Annunzio.

I think I should say something here, wedge into the discussion.

For me, Nikuko is a person, not a stereotype. She is based most vaguely on
a couple of people I know. She is also an actant.

The Japanese for years have borrowed and transformed from US and other
cultures; the fact that I am working through various ideas in a reversal
of that borrowing should not categorize it as defamatory in any way. I
should add that I am not duplicating, not copying; I am changing, not
Japan, not Japanese culture, nothing to do with that. Nor could I if I
wanted to, nor do I know enough.

As far as exoticism goes, I do not think that way. I think of a yardstick
between or among cultures or parts-objects of cultures, of denials, etc.
If I use ukiyo-e for example, I know its degree of japonisserie.

The Japanese have pioneered in microelectronics, from Sanrio stuff to
computer pets to Casio. Nikuko is just such a microelectronic. She is
wearable and she wears me.

As far as the discomfort is concerned, that is deliberate. I wish to
violate borders, violate gender, violate sexuality, violate PC, violate
mythologies, including those of the reading of the "east" by the so-called
"west" and vice versa - although the latter can only occur within a
limited framework. Thus I was told by my efl class that New York was
impossibly dangerous; very well, let us write dangerously, violently, to
the degree say that the language inverts, turns on itself.

I do not want to write safely. I have no interest in that. I have no
interest in PC; the nazis were the most PC group I can think of. If there
is either an avant-garde or experimental tradition left, it has to move
on, to probe, to discomfort, to dis-ease, as well as create stereotypical
works of incandescent beauty. Unfortunately, language is no longer a
virus; instead it is a sign of comfort, just as poetics and poetry have
become signs of comfort. Even the experimental. Even the experimental
"tradition."

Finally, I have no interest either in being an inspiration for moving
people in or out of adulthood. Adulthood is not what it is cooked up to
be; if anything, it is scars and contamination.

I have no desire to educate.

Alan

I have strong doubts about whether this happens to be true, because of one
fairly obvious flaw:  Fuchs was never a spy for the Nazis, he was a spy for
the Soviets.  Anyhow, why would the Nazis wish to funnel bomb secrets _to_
a scientist working at the Manhattan project, which was intended to create
a bomb to be used against Germany?  And is there any evidence that Fuchs
and Schonberg met or corresponded with one another?  And furthermore, how
long would it take to compose, orchestrate and record a piece of serial
music, then have it broadcast or otherwise distributed?  Not the most
efficient means of passing along information.  Doesn't make much sense.

The following may or may not help - I write a great deal of theory in
relation to Nikuko, Alan, Jennifer, Julu (and others) - all of which,
including the literary per se, is sent to the lists I co-moderate. The
following short text was sent recently as a commentary on some of the
more direct texts.

There is more of course at my urls.

Alan

URL:     http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html
MIRROR with other pages at:   http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt
__________________________________________________________________________



Situating the recent texts -


(Think of them in relation to the following.)

1 Issues of departure, punctum - carrying mementos which then trigger, not
memories, but reconstitutions - so that there are skeins of mementos re-
sulting in articulating structures across membranes, emerging and building
the membrane. Identity is lost among mementos, membrane, ego, background
information which is always already a reconstitution itself.

2 Issues of sloughed, discarded, displaced, replaced identities - Nikuko,
Jennifer, and Julu disappearing into "she," Alan as back-and-forth shuttle
- again, a skein or membrane, in this case, of sliding functions of attri-
butions, destabilized. Although the Net becomes a locus of stability, its
fast-forward development and easy avatar construction/transformation
creates potentials for merging/submerging as well. Truth is replaced by
functional or dysfunctional constructions.

3 Differentiations between local and non-local topographies, the latter,
within the physical world, at an _absolute_ remove, no immanence, no tran-
scendence. It is different on-line, and on-line global hyper-linking gives
the false potential of imminence; only lag brings the machinery to the
foreground for most users.

4 Among issues of slippage, skeins, membranes, science as _that structure_
differentiated from all others, in the sense of its core-theoretical arm-
ature. Relating this to a writing-degree-zero (taken from Barthes of
course), or a weakened absolute vis-a-vis the humanities.

5 Among issues of transcendence, a ruptured shintoism as god-generator,
problematizing the distinction between "mundane" and "spiritual" in worlds
among worlds, without redemption (which I do not believe is possible).

6 The author slides as well, and who is writing this outline or summari-
zation, who is responsible for these words? Responsibility fragments as
part-objects fly everywhere, as texts transform into sourceless clutter.

7 Nikuko continues to remain a nexus or problematic - of language, gender,
positioning of the "name" or vector. _I would not be surprised to meet
Alan on the street someday, no matter how much I am aware of the virtual,_
Nikuko says. Nikuko is a probe, the sensitive written skin or membrane of
the analysis, both actant and residue.

8 Dream, lack, rim, touching the file / touching the body, continue to
play roles as guiding metaphors. The _dream_ is an intermediary state
among dreams and reals; _lack_ references ontological and epistemological
issues; _rim_ relates to rim-job, effluvia, balancing, discomfort of in-
termediary states. Every file touched is a (virtual) body touched; every
reference to Nikuko contributes to her body, is a performance by Nikuko.
(Exalted) Positions are jostled; the destabilization results in semiotic
sprays/splays emissions (of texts, part-objects, sputterings, mementos),
gathered together across membranes, lamina...

9 The sexual, emotional, and political economies of Jennifer, Alan, Julu,
and Nikuko, but I would let the others speak for that. Adolescent!

Yes. This was just hashed out in the John Cage mailing list. There is no
reason to believe this is true. I mean, Schoenberg as a Nazi collaborator?
(I believe someone did a little research and found no evidence for this as
a true AP article or any proof that the reporter actually exists.)

Subject:      Re: Quo uncomfortable Vadis

David --


I suppose the flip side to your point ("'uncomfortable' a chilling grounds for the dismissal of a poem") is the position taken numerous times by Adrienne Rich (in her preface to her Collected, in an interview she did with APR a while back) to some of her own early work, where she finds herself disturbed by the way she takes the metaphor/image of South African diamond miners. I don't have the quotations here (far away from the library) -- perhaps someone could post a few if they think it worthwhile.

"Uncomfortable" certaintly is a chilling ground for dismissal, if one takes uncomfortable to mean the unsettling of someone's attitute towards preconceived notions. But the blanket application of your assesment can be taken to legitimize homophobia, racism, you name it (no offense intended.) Americans are (rightly) terrified by the notion of censorship, and this terror can be manipulated.

In the APR interview, Rich is implicitly accused of being a "censor", and responds by saying something along the lines of "well, you certaintly have to have some kind of internal censor if you're in a position of dissent in this country." I haven't read Alan's Nikukos (trying to track it down now over a slow connection), but Nada "Ume" Gordon's response seems to be one that cannot be dismissed or brushed away.

Perhaps I share Rich's POV on the source of language's power (which I've never really seen as self-generating out of its internal structure but instead a net of historical accidents -- perhaps this list might change that.) Not being aware of the realities of what you are referring to -- whether it be mining in South Africa or the exoticization of Asian women -- is no excuse; just as we would criticize a poet who confused details of the physical world, we should critize one that confuses the political. Many would disagree -- I think the prevailing attitude among people who "prefer Rich's earlier work" is that she has gone too far, has lost touch with the "pure" response to language necessary to poetry.

How possible is it to abandon traditional approaches to content in an investigation of poetry that generates and relies upon manipulations and investigations of form?


        -- Simon


Since this is my first post to the list, I thought I might continue Ken Bolton's tradition and say 'hullo'; I'm a student up in Massachusetts (although right now down in Aricebo, Puerto Rico), studying, in various ways, philosophy, literature and mathematics. I also write; some of my work (mostly analytic) is up at http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~sdedeo/localpapers.html, should anyone be interested.

   To me, anything people do, or fantasize doing, is material for a poem,
even while in another sense it is immaterial to a poem. What is telling is
the intensity, the involvement and detachment, the ratios and timings, with
which it is done. "Bombs opening like flowers"--who can forget that?**
Because I was nearly killed during The Blitz takes nothing away from that
image. Political rectitute would be the death of poetry. That said, of
course one is allowed whatever response or reaction s/he has to a poem. I
speak up here today only because I would find "uncomfortable" a chilling
grounds for the dismissal of a poem, and hope Charles and Nada may find it
operates for them as an entrance to, rather than an exit from, Alan's work.

I want to add, re: the recent post, that "uncomfortable" does not mean
condemnatory. I am not uncomfortable with racism; I deplore it - the same
with sexism, etc. For me and possibly for David, although I can't speak
for him of course, "uncomfortable" can imply something that invades the
body, that takes over the mind, mirrors and shatters within - that con-
tains, in other words, a degree of self-reflexivity, much like Kristeva's
abject. That's a far cry from condoning any -ism at all.

As a hoax this is pretty funny!  The reporters name is "Heinrich Kincaid,"
which strikes me funny.  It is a good name.  Too good!  Plus the quote from
John Adams ."Ever since I first encountered compositions by Arnold
Schonberg I wondered what the hell anyone ever heard in it. .Now I know."
That's funny.  What was really funny is when the report commented that
"Toru Takemitsu took time out from his own neo-romanticism to transmit data
via music of his nation's progress with the atom."  Since when did Japan
have Atomic power? Plus the quote from Mr. Glass  " that musicians
continued to write twelve-tone music after the war, even though they had no
idea why it was really invented.
Indeed, there are guys who are churning out serialism to this day."

However thanks for the post, this has been fun.

_______________________________________________________________________



(Another) description of current work -


For the past several years, I have been developing a _pathological_
apparatus that operates in the interstice between subjectivity and
protocol. The apparatus is characterized by the rigid designators of
proper names which serve to ground supplements or leakage across do-
mains; the names can reference avatar-constructs on one hand, and
dissolution/dispersion on the other.

The apparatus as interstice exploits system loops and resonances, as
well as repetitions and pre-verbal components in the written language;
the result is more often than not broken texts which emanate from the
throat relative to the hand. Full of glottal stops and vulnerable sites,
the texts reference a non-existent body; the name does the rest. _Julu_
processes desire, acts as consort to _Jennifer,_ who splays the residue
of sexuality. _Nikuko_ operates upon languages and misrecognitions; Ni-
kuko also constitutes a politico-monetary economy. Jennifer has infil-
trated sendmail files, talkers, and MOOs, among other applications; in
relation to Julu, dialogs are created, insisting on the reality of the
virtual "in no uncertain terms." (Nikuko has infiltrated IRC as well.)

It is this insistence that construes psychosis, this gestural flux in
and through networks and cables. The use of extreme and/or obscene
language serves to displace or derail intercourse; speech through writ-
ing projects enunciation, the function of the throat. The topography of
the virtual body, through its topology, inverts; the display of organs
carries its own politics within the debris of theory. From the vantage
of the reader, there is always a dis-ease at work, as well as the work
required to interpret distorted language, broken semantics, perforated
syntax..

Across the board, issues are epistemological, struggling with a referent
which may be only circumscription, demarcation. Nikuko references kanji
and the presence of english as two signing systems whose interaction
occurs in the imaginary; the name slides from protocol to protocol, app-
lication to application, carrying the vestiges of a haunting or uncanny
writing apparatus whose trace or spoor is identical with ontology.

Agency is spread among actants here; the reciever/transmitter/channel/
noise/parasitic approach to communnications is blurred. There is both
strategy and struggle over the performative and its existence in several
levels, of programming, speech, person (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...), and text.
Whatever is constituted is always already binary or triadic within the
machine; this level is a fundamental reference, but as such is always
leaky as well; there are no foundations, no ground-level platform, say,
for Jennifer.

The result is always textual, immobile-paralytic or mobile-inert; these
writings are residue of psychoanalytic operations carried out as a process
of burrowing. (The texts began when gopher:// was in detumescence.) The
writings analyze these operations as well; they are self-reflexive to
the extent that they drag protocol-debris, application-residue, to the
surface, as in the dissection-analysis of core-dump. The drag is always
an interference, drag-show. The panties are inside-out; the stains are a
lure, seduction, into and away from the content. The stains drag the
reader down and in; they break through the ostensible content, "Julu,"
"Nikuko," of the texts - scatter writing, speech, language as a churning
of pre-verbal clutter, clashes of interstitial drives, breakdown of
prefixes, interfixes, suffixes.

Language spread through its own demise, emergent psychoanalytics drugged
through networks and computer-mediated-communications. Broken language
analyzes, is analyzed through, theory; broken theory or what I call
"wild theory" results, nomadic or marauding theory. The theory chokes in
the throat; instead of weak, think of liquid theory, part-objects fall-
ing out of analysis. Theory and experience are always already inter-
twined, but here experience, tumescence, robs or displaces theory in
favor of a darker analysis. Hence the emphasis on shadows, ghosts, psy-
choses, frisson.

To accomplish what but the endurance or perseverence of virtual subjec-
tivity in these broken problematic spaces. To construct a torn discourse
or _violation fabric_ across foreclosed and corporate domains and names.
To cite myself in the final stages of withdrawal. To open. For the mil-
lennium, to love and hate my avatars. And to open/close a variety of
philosophy, simultaneously, or at least within the @blink of an @dig
$thing called eye.

it's early here in connecticut...let me corrrect
that typo and add a bit to tosh's question...

anton webern was, by all i heard, a peaceful man
who worked in the swiss alps throughout the war
removed from the politics of WW2...at night, after
composing, he would step outside for a smoke before
retiring, as his wife would not allow him to smoke
his cigars in the house...one night, 2 days after
the war was ended, an american soldier who hadn't
heard the news was patrolling around the remote
area of webern's house and shot him dead while
webern, perhaps 20th century's most rigorous adherent
of the technique called serialism, was gunned down...

there is a book about this murder that i cannot
recall the title of now, but would be willing to
look around for it if someone's interested...a
fascinating read...

also, relevant to this list...the twelve tone composers
(later called serialists) were closest in nature to
the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets for the music of the time
...taking tonalism out of music and bringing a pure
syntax of intervals their relationships as the sole
justification for musical composition...much like the
language poets, to my reading, took syntax as the
material to be worked with, over content- and subject-
based material as its focus...

(Wesleyan University Press). The book explores the development of gay=20

and short-story collections, it's Killian's first biography, but it's not=

his first connection to the influential Beat writer. Killian recalls bein=

david, alan, all

it isn't the explicit sexuality of alan's work that makes me uncomfortable
(although he does seem to like to write *membrane*, which you've got to
admit is kind of a creepy word), and i agree that anything people fantasize
doing is material for a poem

even violent or violating (i once wrote a cut up poem from the eye of a
child rapist/killer, Tsutomu Miyazaki, who cut up his victims; long ago i
wrote about sticking a toe with an overlong toenail into someone's... oh,
never mind)

and i even said that i find a lot of alan's poems beautiful, although he
didn't seem to acknowledge that in his response to my comment but rather
lit into me like i was catherine mckinnon trying to put the lid on his
creation

like i was trying to be PC!  whoa!

far from it

all i said, and all i mean, was that the poems make me feel uncomfortable
sometimes (note -- not a DISMISSAL, not even DISAPPROVAL david! but a
response), and annoyed, and angry

and not in the way that anything of Stein or Creeley or Duncan or Acker or
Ginsberg ever has

but possibly in the way that Henry Miller has
or Norman Mailer

because they flatten women out
(unlike Creeley who found his love-object too mysteriously dimensional)

flat, flat, flattened

or sad the way my students with eye jobs and breast jobs and six-inch heels

i'm sure you like araki's photographs

i guess if that's your true desire
to violate i mean
then you must be gratified by my response
instead of defensive about it

it really is a grand project
and unimpeachable from a purely aesthetic point of view
but it upsets me

and i think i have a right to that
and also that you can expect responses like mine
from the gut and not prissy
if you spray your work all over the cyber-world


you write also:

no neither do i, but i don't think violate is my verb of choice

Please!  I don't look for "comfort" in art either, in the sense of matzoh
ball soup for the soul (like you, I guess, I'm jewish) -- and I loathe

Hmm.  I quote myself:

        Adult life is a) revenge
        b) redemption

but i suspect it also has something to do with learning responsibility and
how not to scathe the world and other people, maybe that's the redemprion
part

or maybe i am just being quite the schoolmarm

I use "membrane," which doesn't creep me at all, to indicate both the
fragility and the presence of the Net-without-nodes, almost as a sentient
surface.

This is what I was reacting to, since I see no relationship with these
people, and years ago, in fact, Acker and I did some collaborations.

This is what bothers me. If you are teaching a classroom, or from someone
else's viewpoint, say a nation of Nikukos, and in fact Nikuko for me is
much more specific than that, then you are also saying _they're_ flattened
-
>
> or possibly the way the guys who dumped me for a little geisha-girl hot
> roppongi action have

and much as I don't know your history, isn't "little geisha-girl" also
disparaging? For me, Nikuko is somewhat of a hero - she's associated in a
lot of my writing with either the sun-goddess or kami - she has powers
that aren't necessarily sexual or based on seduction.
>

>
> oh, the flatness

I feel both sad about this and unable to comment, except you're passing a
judgement on these people. From the little I saw of Japanese students, and
the ones I talked to, a lot of what _they_ were concerned about was kept
to themselves, or expressed in social/hobby clubs at the uni, not in the
classroom and not in relation to the teacher.

For me she was a composite of two people plus the sun-goddess, neither of
whom fit your model; I think you're reading things I don't intend.

This doesn't imply that all violation is worthwhile.
>

> instead of defensive about it

No, because it goes in the direction of stereotyping itself - Nikuko is
such-and-such a person and I know these people and these people are flat.

Because of worry over misrecognition, misreading, and for that matter,
after the fact, the last thing I wanted to do was bring up bad memories

I took part-time work to help with the income. But I also found that the
class and other classes I sat in for that matter, were often what Aram
Saroyan called "filling out the form," that they had no real purpose in

I think what I need to do here is not send Nikukomaterial, so to speak, to
this list; on occasion, other work, of which I have done sufficient. For
the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone, or bring up these issues,
which are so personal they're hard to respond to.

In the meantime, if anyone is interested on seeing the whole shebang, in-
cluding, say, Nikuko's essays on the philosophy of science, it's all at
the webpages, most of it I think in files ke-ki.

No. Simply because that is not what they are doing. They are not simply
borrowing. They are intentionally and randomly distorting and merging other
people's works. That is all that they are doing.

When we borrow something we maintain at least some of its original integrity.
We do not twist it and convolute it until we destroy it. We use it in a
manner that remains recognizable.

No. You definitely do not understand. You want to twist what I am saying
into cultural relativism of one kind or another. That is not what I said. I
said that they despise art. There are varying intensities of this. Some
Marxists, communists, have been very violent and oppressive towards artists.
Relative freedom of expression, and therefore art as we understand it,
cannot flourish there. Art is reducted to political advertising, or
propaganda, in many such instances. However, they do not tend to be the
extremists that I was referring to. They are extreme, but not so very
extreme. The most extreme are the Moslems. According to their scriptures
"art", in any form as we know it and value it, is absolutely forbidden. That
does not mean that every moslem follows the teachings, but a very large
number do follow it. The only adornments become embellished kufic script and
the religious architecture it adorns. There are indications that all western
art, the fine arts and humanities as we know them,
are considered "satanic" and the mentality desiring their absolute
destruction remains quite active within that foreign (alien to us) culture.

Where such instances of "truth" collide we end in irreconcilable conflict
and that means mutual attempts to influence the outcome of the conflict.

I see some of the struggles within our own cultural tradition (western,
European-North American heritege primarily, but not exclusively), currently
as springing from that particular root of conflict. Each side ends up
wanting to cut down the other side's cultural tree - to uproot as it were.

>Who are "They who have technology and are not cave dwellers"

I was alluding to the common false conception that some foreign cultures
lack the ability to distort their rival cultures by technological means. The
underestimations of the KGB during the Cold War were sometimes the most
comical instantiations of something of that kind. In essence the tendencies
among some to underestimate the "enemy" or the cultural opponent. Most of
all the attitude that some areas where the people are impoverished and on
average technologically ignorant, lack all covert means. They do not. That
is the misconception. The state of the average population says very little
abnout the body politic. It is not the body politic. Another instantiation
of this, quite outside the realm of radio, radar and microwaves, is Islamic
Pakistan's 'success' as to becoming a nuclear power. Even that fact leads to
underestimations of Pakistan's technological abilities. After all, the bomb
was invented fifty years ago. It is old technology, even if mass
destructive. We then fail to consider the use of other categories of violent
means, including conventional, chemical, biological, and electromagetic.

We also fail to recognize that all nations who share a common ideology tend
to share their technological capabilities, to a very large extent, with each
other.
Particularly if they have larger ambitions as to cultural, (which always
involves ideological), expansion and conquest.

In our example we then find reasons to believe that many other similarly
affiliated nations have gained nuclear capabilities. Similarly biological
and chemical warfare capabilities. We might see Libya, or Syria, Iraq, Iran,
and others, as all sharing with one another, similar technological means.

Apply that same viewpoint to electromagnetic means of potential influence
and we quickly find that we live within a technologically conflicted, sphere
of cultural and ideological influence conflicted, nightmare. The Cold War
with the USSR was only one scene in one act of the whole play of various
endgames, including those that involve attempted conquest of the human mind
by whomever happen to be the primary cultural competitors.

Quite aside, but on that loosely phrased illustrative example, from current
politics, I cannot say that I see a positive outcome for American and allied
economic and diplomatic sanctions against Pakistan. I see that as furthering
the excerbation of hostile sentiments and perhaps leading to their eventual
venting, exteriorized from the increased hardships and sufferings, so that
the sanctions act as a kind of catalyst, to a more radically violent
military expression. How extreme that might end up being, is an open
question. It depends on how strong the reactions are to the sanctions and to
the other actions of other nations.

this is such a difficult discussion for me... i've said before that i've
liked alan sondheim's work, and i've indicated what i liked most about
it---esp. in his earlier stuff, his capacity for theorizing the net in
terms of psychoanalytical (term used advisedly) and mathematical allegories
(ok this is sloppy)...

in fact i believe this is a rather formal claim (of appreciation, i
mean)... sometimes i enjoy the poems alan posts to the list---i can see the
logic of unix, say, as this logic becomes a means to devise personalities
and corresponding exchanges between same...

at the same time, i *am*, with nada, put off (i don't believe the
comfort/discomfort pair will get us much mileage, for all sortsa reasons)
by what i see at times as a celebration of, say, the logical level (or,
still in somewhat lay terms, computing level) with less regard (than i'd
like to see) for the (fuller?) implications this level has for readings
that operate beyond/beside/coterminus with it... b/c i don't see how one
can wish away such readings, not least b/c of the fraught and diverse
nature of the (social and political and epidemiological etc.) real... which
includes of course the daily life-world nada obviously inhabits...

this, one might argue, is precisely the risk of such work... i.e., that it
might not *work* for some readers, depending on the reader herself,
reader's context, alla those variables... it's not so much a matter (alan)
of whether one comes to your work to be educated, exactly (though i think
education and learning, as general metaphors for aesthetic practice, have
their place)... it's more a matter of the ways your work disperses a
wide-range of considerations that will (b/c they can) be plugged into
discourses that, e.g., don't on the one hand determine pleasure in terms of
such maneuvers, and, on the other, locate the works at a remove of what's
deemed urgent...

sure, one can say that all writing/art/whatever enjoys (?) such attention,
lack of attention, what have you... one can say that the job, as it were,
is to find ways to negotiate such attentions w/o (if this is your hobby
horse, more and more these days it's mine) contributing to a fucked-up
planet... but of course any work can probably be made to speak to any
agenda, and of course the pain of such work (or the work of such work, or
even the fun of such work) is in understanding its tentative/provisional
nature even as it enacts, in its very self-presence, a certain set of very
unprovisional and untentative assumptions (be they aesthetic, political,
etc.----meanings/encounters fluctuate, sure, but there is this matter of
the text's role in such fluctuations, at times i want to say to mself, JUST
GET ON WITH IT fer chrissakes joe)...

a lesson?... perhaps... alan's plan is certainly worth perusing on the web
in toto... at the same time, nada's response, though perhaps a response to
somewhat isolated works distributed more singularly to poetix, is one with
which i can identify... depends on the particular work---i'm not always
sure, this much must be clear, what the hell alan is up to, and i don't
automatically celebrate that with which i am unfamiliar---i've had to work
harder than most, perhaps, to learn to let go, but i think i'm permitted
this initial bit of resistance w/o necessarily judging a work as unworthy
of my attention...

so alan, i think, from where i sit, that nada registers an attendant risk
that i see, too, in your work... and nada, have a look at some of alan's
more extensive provocations---they're not for all "tastes," not always for
mine either, but they do amount to a keen and reflexive sense of what's
generally at stake in such gestures, even if no theoretical vantage-point
gets around a certain act of faith...


er, even the one i enact by asserting so...

best to both of you///

Subject:      Feedback
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This discussion of Alan Sondheim's work- which I have come to enjoy quite a
lot-his complex, strange and challenging writing seems rewarding to me in
direct proportion to the work I put forth over time into the effort of
"understanding" it- and I use the word "understanding" here the same way I
would use it to account for my ability to enjoy a kind of music- I feel
leads out into a broader topic of the part feedback plays, or should or
shouldn't play, in the life and work of a poet, and even a serious reader
and supporter of contemporary poetry.I do not wish, of course, to
appropriate or shortcut this valuable discussion of Sondheim's work by
bringing up this related general issue.

This issue, I confess, is one of my chief obsessions. For example, I find
that in my work as a social worker or psychoanalyst, the issue of feedback,
in the course of several decades of practice, seems to have fallen into
place as a minor, though admittedly, important character. On the other
hand, if I give a poetry reading or I publish something,or even if I write
something on this list! the craving for feedback, or response, can be
intense to a point of discomfort.

An aspect of all this that I have been thinking about has to do with the
apparent necessity for a poet, something like an actor or a politician,
let's say, to assemble, over time, a kind of constituency. So that when I
give a reading, close friends might call to apologize for not showing up,
perhaps in an effort to let me know that although they were not there this
was not meant to show a lack of "support" for my work.

Now it seems only to the extent that I can integrate this dynamic into the
forward movement of my writing, that I can continue to write with pleasure.
When I was younger, I think I knew all of this would happen, so I delayed
throwing my hat into the ring for years. Once you are a known quantity, the
fact is, you must accept the public aspect of your writing process.
Fighting it, in a way,  comes down only to a process of denial, like the
playwrights who claim never to read the reviews of their plays. Saying they
haven't read them can be useful, though, in not having to discuss the
unpleasant details with their friends,for example.Giving readings,in fact,
is one of the ways that a writer can get immediate feedback and actually
see and feel a response to the work in the here and now. Ted Berrigan,in
his teaching, always emphasized the importance of giving poetry readings.

On the other hand, perhaps this topic is one which is best not thought
about or discussed too much, I don't know. In any case, I had the impulse
to "share this" (why do I hate that phrase?)

This 12-tone music as Nazi code thing has got to be a joke... and an unfunny one
at that. The same "strangeness" David Bromige speaks of in poetry is equally
sought after in other media. The increasing exploration of chromaticism as tonal
music evolved (tonality as we think of it only really came into common use in the
17th century) led to Schoenberg's complete breakdown of tonality. The 12-tone
method of composition was a way to make lack of tonality absolute -- no one note
occurs any more or less than on other. The challenge, as that of poetic form, is
to create something "meaningful" within these boundaries. As for those who "never
got it" -- dunno. Maybe they should stick to top 40. I've always found strange
beauty aplenty in much atonal music... especially Berg's violin concerto. And, I
believe Schoenberg was in L.A. for much of his career anyway.

propaganda, in many such instances. However, they do not tend to be the
extremists that I was referring to. They are extreme, but not so very
extreme. The most extreme are the Moslems. According to their scriptures
"art", in any form as we know it and value it, is absolutely forbidden. That
does not mean that every moslem follows the teachings, but a very large
number do follow it. The only adornments become embellished kufic script and
the religious architecture it adorns. There are indications that all western
art, the fine arts and humanities as we know them,
are considered "satanic" and the mentality desiring their absolute
destruction remains quite active within that foreign (alien to us) culture.

Where such instances of "truth" collide we end in irreconcilable conflict
and that means mutual attempts to influence the outcome of the conflict.

I see some of the struggles within our own cultural tradition (western,
European-North American heritege primarily, but not exclusively), currently
as springing from that particular root of conflict. Each side ends up
wanting to cut down the other side's cultural tree - to uproot as it were.

>Who are "They who have technology and are not cave dwellers"

I was alluding to the common false conception that some foreign cultures
lack the ability to distort their rival cultures by technological means. The
underestimations of the KGB during the Cold War were sometimes the most
comical instantiations of something of that kind. In essence the tendencies
among some to underestimate the "enemy" or the cultural opponent. Most of
all the attitude that some areas where the people are impoverished and on
average technologically ignorant, lack all covert means. They do not. That
is the misconception. The state of the average population says very little
abnout the body politic. It is not the body politic. Another instantiation
of this, quite outside the realm of radio, radar and microwaves, is Islamic
Pakistan's 'success' as to becoming a nuclear power. Even that fact leads to
underestimations of Pakistan's technological abilities. After all, the bomb
was invented fifty years ago. It is old technology, even if mass
destructive. We then fail to consider the use of other categories of violent
means, including conventional, chemical, biological, and electromagetic.

We also fail to recognize that all nations who share a common ideology tend
to share their technological capabilities, to a very large extent, with each
other.
Particularly if they have larger ambitions as to cultural, (which always
involves ideological), expansion and conquest.

In our example we then find reasons to believe that many other similarly
affiliated nations have gained nuclear capabilities. Similarly biological
and chemical warfare capabilities. We might see Libya, or Syria, Iraq, Iran,
and others, as all sharing with one another, similar technological means.

Apply that same viewpoint to electromagnetic means of potential influence
and we quickly find that we live within a technologically conflicted, sphere
of cultural and ideological influence conflicted, nightmare. The Cold War
with the USSR was only one scene in one act of the whole play of various
endgames, including those that involve attempted conquest of the human mind
by whomever happen to be the primary cultural competitors.

Quite aside, but on that loosely phrased illustrative example, from current
politics, I cannot say that I see a positive outcome for American and allied
economic and diplomatic sanctions against Pakistan. I see that as furthering
the excerbation of hostile sentiments and perhaps leading to their eventual
venting, exteriorized from the increased hardships and sufferings, so that
the sanctions act as a kind of catalyst, to a more radically violent
military expression. How extreme that might end up being, is an open
question. It depends on how strong the reactions are to the sanctions and to
the other actions of other nations.

I am now at liberty to reveal that George Bowering's poetry, in many of his
books "a-tonal" in structure, often consists of heavily encrypted messages
being transmitted to Cuba about the seaward defenses of Bellingham, WA.
This dates back to the TISH years--scholars will note the coincidence of
Castro's revolution with the laun ching of this poetry newsletter. So an
entire school of writing in Canada has been based on this false premise :
it was never poetry, it was spying!  Canadian authorities, responding to
pressure from the United States, will shortly be removing all books of
poetry from Canadian libraries, that bear any traces of TISH influence, and
billing these authors for the return of any Canada Council monies they may
have received under these false pretenses. The brazenness of the operation
is revealed when one learns that 'TISH' is the acronymn from"Technical
Information Shipping Harbor".

Thanks to everyone for making comments and commitments, for drawing lines and
arrows and hearts and circles.  Go figure: poetics on the "poetics" list!

(And thanks to Tom Orange, whose post on Jeff Clark I think started this
long overdue discussion.)

You had better be interested in it.

The other guys, and their gals, want _YOUR_ culture _OFF_ this planet.

Are you planning on simply packing your bags and leaving ?
They would happily see you off. That's it. Simply see you out and off.

That would put a new direction to the space program.

As for music not being related to technowar. Deconstructive music is
essentially emulative of one facet of technowar. It reflects it perfectly.
Of course, there is a two edged sword in that. It is protest against certain
conflicts within the cultural millieux of the planet. It is also becomes
a means for many to experience something in a less dangerous contextual
situation, and thus the very cultural manifestation that knowingly or
unknowingly protests what amounts to a kind of technowar becomes preparation
for technowarriors. That irony is repeated again and again in every culture,
though differently, and at all levels of technological sophistication.

I would go along with Croce's aesthetics: "pure"poetry is not pure music,
not a sort of Absolute before which any sort of moral "discomfort" is equal
to "censorship".  "Pure" poetry, true poetry, for Croce, was a balance
between referentiality and music, word and world.

Poetry is an undertaking of enormous power because unlike philosophy it
gets "inside" natural phenomena - from the most basic to the most
intellectual & spiritual.  Mimesis.  But such power need not become
an excuse for idolatry or a sort of aesthetic gnosis vaunting itself
as beyond good & evil, or beyond rational critique.  Poetry is a gift
providing something rational critique (objective observation) can never
provide; but such a gift does not entail the destruction of rational
critique.

Every poet's work implies a worldview.  The most basic forms of literary
art - parable and riddle - employ mimesis and storytelling in order to
foreground THE REAL.  Poetry (and all art) is a quintessence of reality.
But reality includes self-consciousness, reason, and critical awareness;
the proposed complexity and subtlety of Alan's project certainly don't
negate Nada's demurral.

Alan says he "knows" Nikuko (personally) and she IS "flat".  All well and
good, I guess; documentary realism in an ex-cathedra footnote?
It's all all too "documentary" for my taste, despite the computer
bells & whistles.  But I haven't given it a fair reading.  I like to
choose my own reading.  That's why I'm TRYING myself not to post so much
to the list these days... (one reason, anyway).

the experience of a part of Asia by a non-Asian or even sometimes by a
person from another part of Asia is frequently a prized possession,
that's true with other worlds as well but not so many of us are in a
position to engage and write re some of the other worlds, either they are
less interesting (tho Luc Sante is writing Belgium for us) or too
strongly possessed by bilinguals/biculturals (who would care about a
gringo take on central America anymore?).  furthermore the experience
that is involved involves sex and gender and stereotypes in all
directions.  the list has seen discussion about specifically Japanizing
stereotypes, I won't dredge that stuff up again, but in the case of Nada
and Alan, I see some measure of the longtime visitor and short time
visitor disagreeing on who has seen what, though I may be being unfair to
Alan in terms of the extent of his Japanimmersion. or  better, the
discomfort for Nada/Ume comes from the violation of her ownership of her
experience by Alan in his Nikuko works.   It appears that Ume/Nada's
Japan has a lot more texture and depth and grain and substance than
Alan's.  However I also enjoy reading the Nikuko works, I don't have as
much invested and sometimes the texture is flat.

A recent novel AUDREY HEPBURN'S NECK  (can't recall authors name, it is
in Penguin I think) is very good and approaches some of these issues from
another angle.

I have also been meaning to recommend (if anyone has gotten this far) the
most recent MURAKAMI Haruki novel, THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE and the
first translation of Wang Shuo (the great post-modern Chinese writer)
into English, PLAYING FOR THRILLS.  They are both terrific and,
incidentally, very interesting to read side by side for what they do with
the conventionsof the noir detective story and the issue of the buried
past.

Hello all,

Glad to see Ron and others mentioning the SF Examiner article. I just
saw it myself earlier and got a tingle in my toes. For those of you
unfortunate enough not to live in the Bay Area, or who haven't checked
out the article online, here's a little teaser (come on now, lean in a
little closer): In the article they admit that they have sex (Gasp!)
with each other (Gasp! Gasp!). And there's a great plug for Dodie's
long-awaited _Letters of Mina Harker_, as well as for Kevin's
oft-referenced "Spicer Book." In addition, if yer "in the neighborhood,"
the 10th anniversary performance of KK's "That" is happening this Friday
(June 5) at the New College Theatre, 777 Valencia, 7:30 p.m.

In reference to Ron's question, Glen Helfand may very well have done
_Socialist Review_ covers. He's very much about town doing film and art
reviews, and has done some great book covers, including one for me and
one for Abigail Child.

Alan's journey is pure energy.  I cringe and marvel; he is brilliant.
Perhaps he could be something else, more controlled, less challenged, but,
were he so, might not we regret his passing?  Where else would he live if
not in the company of poets?
