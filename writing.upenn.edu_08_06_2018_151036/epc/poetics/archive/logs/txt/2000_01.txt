George,

I can't imagine only reading one or two books at a time -- even though it
sometimes takes me a year to read a book "cover to cover" when surrounded by
all its peers.

Here's my list
The Letters of Mina Harker, by Dodie Bellamy (just finished -- last book of
the millennium for me and a total dazzler)

Frank Lima, Inventory
Laurie Price, Except for Memory (great underappreciated book)
Ron Padgett, New & Selected Poems
Cole Swenson, Noon
Charles Bernstein, My Way (don't expect to finish this until 2001)
Philip Whalen, 0vertime
Rod Smith, Protective Immediacy (best ear of his generation)
Charles Tomlinson, Selected Poems
Edmund Berrigan, Disarming Matter
Pamela Lu, Pamela: A Novel (John Ashbery meets Catcher in the Rye)
Walter Mosley, Blue Light (It wants to be Samuel Delaney sooo bad)
Phillip K Dick, Valis
Annie Finch, Eve
& its secret twin...
Lee Ann Brown, Polyverse
CD Wright, Deepstep Come Shining (great!)

Ron

Dear listers:

The enquiries about the anthology of contemporary South Korean poetry that
featured in my list of end of the century readings have been so
overwhelming that I feel the following information should be made available
to you all:

PO&SIE is a French magazine edited by Michel Deguy and published three
times a year. Its list of "international correspondents" include listmember
Pierre Joris, Clayton Eshelman and Christopher Middleton. The South Korean
issue came out this Summer and was guest-edited by Claude Mouchard and Kim
Hee-kyoon. Full details of how to subscribe to the magazine are available
from:

Editions Belin
8, rue F=E9rou
75278 Paris Cedex 06

They also have a web site at: http://www.editions-belin.fr

Hope this is useful--all the very best to you all,

Michel

Raise both hands, palm upwards, hunching the shoulders inward, the fore-
head also raised, including the eyebrows. Accompany this with a slight
smile. Point across the space with the index finger of the right hand at
the other. Raise and lower the head in his or her direction. Now bend your
body forward, holding your hands concave/convex (the left hand arched away
from the body, the right hand arched towards the body), draw them across
your limbs, one after the other, slowly lingering. Following this, place
them across your chest, as if you were wrapping a blanket. Then extend
your arms away from your body, with your hands horizontal, mostly flat
with your palms downward, and raise them to a height indicating a great
pile. Sweep outward with your right hand, indicating negation. Now you
have the attention of the other. Look intently at her. She will look back
intently at you, but you must attract her attention to your hands. The
indexfinger of your right hand should then touch her chest, approaching
her in a closed position, except the forefinger should be crooked against
the end of the thumb, with the whole configuration upright and the palm
outward. Now move your hand slowly horizontal, and look intently at her
again. She will look intently at you again with her forehead raised and a
slight expression of consternation, her forehead slightly wrinkled, her
eyes half-opened. Now speak to her slowly and say, "We don't want your
clothes." She will understand your gestures to refer to the great amount
of clothes she has offered you.

Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell by Deborah Solomon
(recent cloth remainder)
Some of These Days, Poems by Philip Whalen (Desert Rose Press). This is an

as flesh) by Clifford Burke, interpreting Whalen's work in his ironic regal,
18th century 'love the language' best.

Exhibits
Man Ray photographs including the "Woman with the Glass Tears" (which, by the
way, for those who want to know, is the first million dollar photograph).
Fraenkel Gallery, 49 Geary St., SF. A total knock-out room of about 12
photographs.

Carleton Watkins at the Met; Daido Mauriyama at the Japan Society and the Met
(NY)

Degas to Picasso (a mis-named show) of the relationship of photographs to
primarily symbolist painters and sculptors. A smart, well thought out show
with very fine pix and pieces at SFMOMA.

Just to add my voice to Michel's: The Korean poetry issue of po&sie is
indeed excellent, and especially useful in that while starting with the
great modernist figure, Yi Sang (Who is also in vil I of JR & my MILLENNIUM
antho) as it features a number of younger Korean poets based in Paris & thus
not well-known in the Anglo-American axis, such as Woo Jong N, Kim
Chang-kyum and Kim Hee-kyoon.

        Po&sie generally is an excellent mag and anyone having some or enough
French should check it out. Deguy is a superb editor, poet and essayist.
Just before typing my list of end-of-century readings I had finished his
lastest, so didn't include it, but here it is: Michel Deguy, _ L'Energie du
désespoir_.

Laura Riding, "Progress of Stories"
Geri Halliwell, "If Only" this memoir by the former Spice Girl is
much better than I thought it would be
James Schuyler, "Selected Art Writing," ed Simon Pettet, I got this
for my birthday and so far it's very disappointing, a crack in the
idol for me, I hadn't realized how awful a book could be when the
writer has nothing to say & yet curiously fascinating because it just
goes on and on and on
Russell Ferguson, "In Memory of my Feelings: Frank O'Hara and
American Art" this is the catalogue from the LA MOCA show which I
missed, another birthday present, beautifully done and Ferguson's
essay not bad for a kind of primer into O'Hara, tho' very basic of
course, I got the feeling he wrote it for people who don't know much
or care much for poetry
"Mary Butts Scenes from a Life," this long, long biography of Butts
seems to be taken most directly from Butts' unpublished diary so we
hear every little thing about her that the diary knows . . .
Unquestionably strengthens my take on Butts' novels and poetry (at
the same time you think, what an awful mother and b, if you or I
smoked 20 pipes of opium a day we'd be awful parents too)  Result,
for my birthday I wanted maybe 4 or 5 pipes of opium, alas, did not
get
"Teller of Tales the Life of Arthur Conan Doyle" finally a biography
that does make sense of  Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism and
the paranormal, I enjoyed this one a lot
"Period," Dennis Cooper's fifth novel, this one comes out in the
stores in March but Dodie is reviewing it and I'm reading it over her
shoulder, very challenging and difficult

"Dusty in London," the so called "lost" recordings of Dusty
Springfield now available on CD from Rhino records, what can I say,
she is so strong and affecting, yes, another birthday present

On another note, we sent out 135 copies of the "Atlanta" issue of our
zine, "Mirage #4/Period[ical]," after the flood of e-mail requesting
them, to the various characters on this list, and to date eight of
you have written back saying you've received it.  This reminds me of
the way Lear mistakenly felt Cordelia ungrateful, and how, before, I
always faulted Shakespeare for making him, Lear, so quick to jump to
sorry conclusions.  In any case, you wonderful eight people have
warmed my heart turning it into a beacon of light and hope for the
year 2000.  You know who you are!

Subject:      Bowering's reading habits//my reading list
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

[note: a partially completed version of this post left here unexpectedly
during a senior moment I was enjoying fifteen minutes since....my
apologies]


Bowering tells us that he cant read more than two books at once. I believe
it, because he is like that in other important ways. Those of us attending
the Moosehead Conference in the previous century, will recall that GB never
left the side of Rachel Loden and Maria Damon, day or night, despite the
blandishments of others present. To my view of these matters, this
near-singlemindedness does him credit, and I say this mindful of the sneers
of such as Jay Gutz, Sasha Mudd and Dwight Cork, idiots fumbling at the
bride's door.

/////////

The only reason my list of currently being-read-by-me books is a bit longer
than GB's, is that I forget where I have laid a book down, so begin to read
another until I can find the first. I am not proud of this procedure. I
simply report it. Also, some of my reading is intense, some, desultory.
Here's a quick & partial list:


=46UTURES, by Ken Edwards.....brilliantly conceived novel that holds the fee=
t
of high finance to the fire of human idiosyncracy.

PETRARCH'S LYRIC POEMS,, ed.Durling....Of use in my current series of poems.

THE POEM ITSELF, ed. Burnshaw. ... : this book is endemic to my reading, as
from time to time I like to tweak the translationese out of this
considerable range of Modernist poems. The extensive prose trots make this
easier.

AUTOCRATS & EGOTISTS, by George Bowering. . . .Not, as some contend, a
history of the friendship between GB and myself, but of each & every Prime
Minister of Canada. A hard book to put down, & an easy one to find again,
as it occupies a quarter-acre, and has a suitably garish cover.
  {
HOTEL IMPERIUM, by Rachel Loden.....Have been re-reading ever since I read i=
t.

VALGA KRUSA, the novel by Charles Potts....My umpteenth time thru this
neglected classic of street- and lounge-poets, revolutionaries, & deadbeats
of the Bay Area 60's...a must if you want a fuller picture of those times,
espec as seed-bed for the poetry of the succeeding decades.

CALL ME LUCKY, by Bing Crosby, or possibly "by" B.C......the official
autobio, loosely strung collection of anecdotes, some more amusing than
others, with the odd historical jewel. A re-read, as I recently turned up
this classic paperback---I owned one just like it decades since, that then
vanished--in a bookcase stuffed with unsorted such items in a local
bookstore, while hunting for Ellery Queens for my father-in-law's xmas
present.

THE GLORIOUS POOL,by Thorne Smith. A glad addition to my collection by this
author, whose risqu=E9 novels entertained my father (& thus my subteen self,
surreptitiously) & continue to divert me, tjhough as much today for the
elegant sentences & unremitting word-play, as for the erotic charge, which,
after all that's interposed itself, seems mild indeed. However, the
fantasy, a pool to restore youth to any still headstrong enough to dive in,
may tickle a reader's  fancy even today :

=46OR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO, by Slavoj Zizek......Just why you enjoy th=
e
buttons on your couch, as unfolded by this Slovenian Lacanian. (Or perhaps
the couch-buttons crop up in this author's EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO
KNOW ABOUT LACAN BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK HITCHCOCK, or his book THE SUBLIME
OBJECT OF IDEOLOGY. For those of us who hold that a joke is consciousness
[though not vice versa], Zizek is an alluring writer. I first found him on
the bookshelf of

Clint Burnham, whose THE JAMESONIAN UNCONSCIOUS i started to read during my
recent stay at Bowering Manor, but was unable to finish as the Master of
the Manor conducted one of his random suitcase searches when I was nearly
out the door. I must order it from SPD.

____________

During my stay there, one evening I watched, in company with GB and his
daughter Thea, a Danish movie that contained the following joke :

Q : Why does an Irishman as he is going to bed place on his bedside table a
full glass of water, and an empty glass?

A : Because, when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he might be
thirsty, or he might not.

**most recent _the temple_

I am teaching a practicum on love poetry at UCLA Extension six weeks
beginning January 11, ending February 15 (with a recap, naturally).  It
is an alternate approach than the currently-popular "Artist's Way" sort
of thing.  For example, we'll be talking about Bellen, Ronk and Genji,
also Joris, Carson, and ideas of eros, in addition to Petrarch, Dante,
et.al.

For more information (registration open until January 11, the first
class):
http://www.ucla.unex.edu/writers
http://www.unex.ucla.edu/catalog/Catalog2.cfm?course_title=Love%20Poetry%3A%20Reading%20the%20Classics%20and%20Writing%20Your%20Own&course_number=X%20423%2E92&quarter=Winter&year=2000&heading_code=N00329&dept=Poetry

Jerrold Shiroma has also included an e-chapbook of mine in the derive
section of Duration Press.  called "The Last Canto", it's my translation
of the last canto of the Divine Comedy and some fun with nouns.  PDF to
come!
http://www.durationpress.com/derive/daly/toc.html

I hear that Bruce Andrews is doing the Inferno; I could be very
interested in doing a (probably electronic) anthology of the Paradiso
with an author and tranlation technique per canto.

In an unlikely result, I am "January Fresh Poet" at
http://www.freshpoetry.com.

May I second the Godard Interviews?  I'd also like to add the new Italian
anthology that came out from Sun & Moon which I don't think has gotten nearly
enough attention.  And Scalapino's New Time, though I know it has been
mentioned.

By the way, Ribot #7, the last Ribot, is available from me, Standard
Schaefer, 1307 Stratford Ave., So. Pasadena, CA 91030 (please note: this is a
new address).  You may write checks to Ribot.

This year's theme was music.

The issue costs $10 dollars and includes the work of George Albon, Douglas
Messerli, Carl Martin,  Nick Piombino, Jacques Debrot, John Lowther, Ray
DiPalma, Raymond Pettibon, Diane Ward, Leslie Scalapino, Aaron Shurin,
Timothy Liu, Avery Burns, Devin Johnston, Brian Lucas, Sheila Murphy, Norma
Cole, Catherine Wagner and many many others.

As I said, Ribot is through.  The magazine that I edit, Rhizome, is likely to
do only one more issue.  However, a new composite international journal is in
the works to be edited by Paul Vangelisti and myself.

Best,

Standard

There's what I mean: there are 15 books, some of them long or dense. Say
you manage to get five hours of reading time a day (and some of it is taken
up by newspapers and magazines)--you wont get more than about 20 minutes
per book. In my house that is called browsing.

book can be found on the Granary website; SPD will distribute.

_The Arcades Project_, Benjamin, Can't wait to dive in

    I was contemplating the other day this thought: when did the word "baby"
develop into a sexual one?  When did mates start using it for terms of
endeatment because it seems to be rotting with connotations of pedophilia.

All y'all purists should note that it's NOT read by Ashbery , though.

Alvin Lucier's setting of John Ashberry's Theme, for four readers
heard through unusual resonating chambers, can be heard as part of
this week's Mappings, my online new music program, available all week
at <http://www.antennaradio.com/avant/mappings/index.htm>.

When Ashbery provided the text to Lucier for this composition the
poem had not been published. I'm not sure if it has subsequently been
printed elsewhere.

Zephyrus Image (aka Hermes Free Press & Spring Creek Typesetting) 1970 - 1982
was one of the San Francisco's most active pre-Regan era Presses. The late
Holbrook Teter (on linotype) and Michael Myers (crow quill pen and linocuts)
executed extraordinary political, literary and ecological broadsides,
pamphlets and books. Variously elegant, exquisite, funky they were fearless
in their use and play with typefaces, found materials, curious paper stocks
combined with an in-the- face intelligence and satirical wit. Corollary
influences of the time included Coach House Press and Impulse magazine in
Toronto and Flux. Most items were passed out for free at readings, bars and
public events.  Project collaborators and writers included William Wiley,
Robert Creeley, Ed Dorn, Tom Raworth, Lucia Berlin, Stephen Vincent, Bill
Barich among several others.
Yours truly has been working with this extraordinary archive for the past
couple of years.  871 Fine Arts (the bookstore and gallery) at 49 Geary St.
(Fifth floor) in San Francisco opens the Zephyrus Image show (graphix and
books) this Thursday evening from 5:30 to 7:30. The exhibit will be up until
April. You is all invited. By the way, on first Thursdays most San Francisco
galleries and the museums are open for the evening. After Zephyrus, go down
to the fourth floor and check out Fraenkel Gallery's  gathering of incredible
Man Rays plus lots of other goodies in all the other galleries in the same
building.
Hope to see you there,
Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Well, if  you are willing to get off the net and read some old-fashioned
books, I would recommend Walter Redfern's *Puns* [1984] and a collection of
essays edited by Jonathan Culler, *On Puns:The Foundation of Letters* [1988].
 Both published by Blackwell [I don't know why].

These are both good.

If there is newer literature on puns I wouldn't mind learning of it. I've
been out of touch.

Got to go along with George Bowering on this, I'm a one book kinda guy.
Right now it's Woody Guthrie: A Life by Joe Klein, though I'm always reading
manuscripts of my friends poesy, with new stuff from Ike Kim currently in
the hopper.

I used to keep a stack of poetry books on my nightstand, like 10 or so, and
randomly flip to a page and read one poem in each, crossing out the title,
before heading to bed. Think I'll supplement my Sportscenter habit and end
my nights this way once more.

as ever,
David

I've heard (and found it true so far) that if you reinforce what you
memorize just enough so that it's still in yer head at 3 checkpoints -- 3
days, 3 weeks, and 3 months after the initial memorization -- then it's
there for life. I still have stuff in my head from back in college ("Leave
me not wild and drear and comfortless / As silent lightning leaves the
starless night!" -- Shelley), like occasionally annoying houseguests who
are still, in the end, better than being alone. ("That is what we love
about art / It seems to prefer us and stays" --O'Hara)

Unless you like rememorizing.

An interview I have conducted with Henry Gould has been put up at
Jacket #10. The piece opens with a fascinating response by Gould
to a comment by Charles Bernstein in his tribute to Barbara Guest
in the same issue. Many other topics are discussed, including
matters relating to the Poetics List, materialism and mysticism in
poetry, the idea of the avant-garde, and so on. I'm sure some of
you will want to take a look!

Happy new century!

Maria,

Yep, I know what you mean about this issue being a bit light on what you
call the "girl end of things."  We've done better in this regard in the
the past three issues.  This bothers me and Valerie too.  Sadly, the
last few months we haven't had many submissions by women that fit our
"no workshop poetry, no language poetry" mandate.  Next time you run
across a woman who writes interesting poetry that can't be assimilated
to either of those two paradigms, have her drop us a line.  9 Campus
Circle, Lake Forest IL 60045.

(Note that Brooke Bergan, Dubravka Djuric and Kymberly Taylor have work
in Samizdat #4 -- Masha isn't the only woman here this time out).

Or there's the parody method--writing a parody will burn the original into
your brain for life--at least it has mine, in the case of Hopkins.

Just thanks to everyone for listing what they're reading.  I'm
amazed/impressed/inspired by how many people are reading so much hardcore
philisophy, and wrote down a bunch of stuff for my reading list for 2000.

Over the weekend I read Wang Ping's Of Flesh and Spirit and found it very
moving, really rich.

I tend not to actually read 8 books at a time, but try to have my nose in
one novel while also browsing through new journals, and reading over
breakfast magazines (Utne Reader, The Atlantic, etc.), plus doing school
reading.

i always like the what are you reading thread    actually  reading
several books magazines etc at once  is  do-able  i think someone
mentioned  something about this
it  makes reading  very different  of course  than  when you read one at
a time
indeed tho  it spreads out  the material over a span of time

i've finally discovered the pleasure  & knowledge   of
newsletters...  i've read
the past few weeks    :        an insight meditation newsletter,   a
running newsletter called  "footnotes"  ,  the newsletter from my credit
union in my old home of portland, the gay & lesbian community  center
newsletter  of nyc    the  newsletter for  my unions  both  regional &
national      newsletter for the new york road runners club & of course
poetry  project  newsletter         all   fascinating nonfiction  so  to
speak

&    over christmas   the wizard of oz     (fabulous   had never read
the whole thing, just watched the movie  every year on tv)  jim  fixx's
book on running from the 70's  ( the   drawings of people  are a
kick)     "mac answers"  a book of macintosh  questions & answers, a
picture book version of the jewish folktale  "golem"  with paper-cut
illustrations    several english folktales   ed dorn  selected poems
lots of e-mail   letters from mom     & some recipes


on another front      did anyone else  go  hear  some  of the making of
americans  marathon? i'd heard about it   a few years  ago  & it was
exciting to finally  go there
a friend & i went  on  thurs    to the gallery it was in and
alternately  dozed daydreamt  & paid attention         stein really was
the perfect  one to hear on new year's eve

Everybody is invited to view my latest work on my new web site at
http://www.99main.com/~swmarks. The two works currently on the site are:

Inminutest Inscrutiae -- a visual poem made with shapes and charts as
well as words taken out of an extremely condensed version of an
abandoned short story.

Ghostwriting Collages -- JPEGs of collages consisting of pages from
business books I have ghostwritten and graphics from stock illustration
books.


Come one. Come all.

Thank you,

EXEMPLIFYING the "symptoms of capitalism" I would like to offer for sale to
the highest bidder a one-and-only art object, the 1st semi-official APG
T-shirt.  (Originally) Extra Large.  100% cotton and made in the U S of A.
The APG T-shirt features; crude 'art brut' style renderings of famous APG
personalities and incidents (including the "inflections wars" and
"the-time-we-forgot-to-plug-the-tape-recorder-in"); a subtle work of 'found
art' (a chipotle salsa stain, that if you squint yr eyes looks something
like the visage of Ron Silliman from the cover of his _the difficulties_
special issue); several lines of Real Poetry by Real Atlanta Poets (all this
on a Ciccone Youth t-shirt reincarnated as a readymade).  This is a once in
a lifetime offer folks.   Backchannel all offers.  Bidding starts at $80.


DISCLAIMER: I make this offer on my own behalf and not as an official
representative of the atlanta poets group, the opinions exemplified by this
offer do not necessarily reflect those of the atlanta poets group, the
electronic poetry center, the poetics list &/or its owner(s) and

I had supposed it was due to an (unthought-thru?) equation of baby-bliss
with sexual-bliss.  If you look into the face of an infant (who isnt
indisposed due to a variety of possible causes!) your look will be returned
with one of riveted fascination. Not unlike your lover's face during
lovemaking.  David

I thought it might be a short form of "babydoll," since it was easier for me
to see why one might equate a plastic pretty molded thing with an attractive
woman than a baby.  Unfortunately.  But an online entymology site tells me
that "baby" as a euph. for "woman" first appeared in 1901 (this excellent
site does not tell me *where* it appeared), while "doll" as a euphemism for
same entered the stage in 1904 ("doll" and "dolly" had previously been used
to refer to prostitutes or "loose" women).

I remember workshopping a poem by a woman who'd titled the work "I Feel My
Baby Moving Inside Me"--sounded to me like a disco song title, actually
referred to a rollicking pregnancy.

Personally, I prefer endearments along the line of "flying buttress,"
"forklift," "serving suggestion," & so on.

Keeping within the baby frame, a list of children's books I've been reading:

--the Harry Potters, of course, first in English, now in Spanish, hoping to
brush up on the language and pop culture at the same time.  What brilliance
there is is in the onslaught of small, delightful, seductive details;
concept-wise, they're no match for, say, "A Wrinkle in Time."

--"What Hearts" & "The Moves Make the Man" by Bruce Brooks, exquisite
"children's" novels that kick the butt of most fiction written for adults in
the past, say, 20 yrs

--"The Scrambled States of America" by Laurie Keller.  Kansas is bored &
wants to mingle, throws a party for the states (great pictures of states
doing the limbo, trying to spell Connecticut while addressing an invite,
complaining about their hairdos, etc.).  At the party, the states decide to
trade places.  Clearly, Minnesota gets sunburn because she's forgotten her
lotion in relocating to the Area Formerly Known as Florida...etc., etc.  A
great first book by this author & illustrator.

--"The Snark-out Boys and the Avocado of Death," Daniel Pinkwater.  Out of
print for years and finally back in an inexpensive book containing 5
Pinkwater novels (& called "Five Novels").  Classic.  As another fan said,
"It'd be worth it just for the description of the potato."

--and scads of picture books.  I keep a list of the exceptional ones, so if
anyone needs recommendations for kids (or selves), I'm your man, your baby,
your flying buttress.

I know workshop poetry when I see it, but what are the boundaries of
language poetry?

A serious question.  I'll be interested in what people have to say.

Thanks for the alert on Pinkwater.

Fat Men From Space one of the great books of all time.  Hope it's one of the 5.

Hi everyone,

I guess I have two categories of reading: "project related" and "for
pleasure" ... except it's all really "for pleasure," finally. The two
projects are (1) things read for a comic book biography of Jack Smith I'm
doing and (2) the pre-Socratics. The lists for either of those would  be
"too much," and probably only of interest to people already interested in
either subject. So, instead, here's the non-project-related stuff, at least
what I've read since December (there's a lot, but many of these are
chapbooks and/or comic books)

David Bromige, _My Poetry_ (still working on this one; it's wonderful)

Sean Cole, _By the author._ (very fun book)

Jordan Davis, manuscript (like best the longer poems here, "When I Was the
Subject," esp.)

Kim Deitch, _Beyond the Pale_ (one of the most bizarre and wonderful of the
underground cartoonists of the 60s & 70s; Deitch never uses brushes or nib
pens, so the drawings look extra flat ... it adds to their oddness)

Tom Devaney, _The American Pragmatist Falls in Love_ (also fun; reminded me
somewhat of Michael Lally, so I just photocopied some Lally for Tom, who
hasn't yet read him)

Julie Doucet, _My New York Diary_ (I reviewed this for Rain Taxi online:
http://raintaxi.com/doucet.html  so I won't say anything about it here,
except to say Julie's one of my current favorite cartoonists)

Betsy Fagin, manuscript of poems-in-progress (this was really fine work,
though she's still futzing with it)

Steve Fagin, _Talkin with Your Mouth Full_ (Brandon mentioned this one; I
read some, not all, of this book hoping to find out more info about his
film, "Tropicola," a movie about Cuba I saw about two, three years ago. The
book was published prior to the film's release, though it's mentioned in a
few places here.)

Phoebe Gloeckner, _A Child's Life_ (I just interviewed her:
http://www.jps.net/nada/gloeckner.htm  so I guess this is really
"project-related" ... issue #2, by the way, is still in the works, though
you can see what's up there already, if you like: http://www.jps.net/nada)

Ted Greenwald, _The Life_ (not sure that's the exact title; it's a Big Sky
book, not long, that I read twice, I loved it so much)

Aaron Kiely, _My Money_ (pretty wonderful, reminiscent a bit of Greenwald's
stuff)

Carol Mirakove, _Walls_ (really nice chapbook; saw Carol read not too long
ago at Zinc; she interviews Hoa Nguyen in Readme #2:
http://www.jps.net/nada/nguyen.htm and there's half a dozen poems from
_Walls_ as well: )

Laurie Price, _Except for Memory_ and _Under the Sign of the House_ (another
"interview" reading assignment: http://www.jps.net/nada/price.htm ... I
agree with what Ron said about her work, and was really thrilled to see her
read at the PoProj marathon)

Dori Seda, _Dori Stories_ (One of the great "personal" underground
cartoonists; unfortunately died young. This collects all of her cartoons,
and reproduces some of her paintings and sculptures)

Chris Stroffolino, _Stealers Wheel_ (re-read this while working on a cartoon
about Chris for Rain Taxi; I love Chris's writing)

Tod Thilleman, _A World of Nothing but Nations_ (yet another
interview-related reading, though I'd read this book -- my favorite poetry
book of 1999 -- before: http://www.jps.net/nada/thilleman.htm

Probably there's more, but I'm at work & don't have everything at hand ...

Have fun,

I think the term "baby" in reference to a lover is just a natural term of
endearment -- in love, we feel protective/possessive/responsible for our
lover, just as we would towards an infant.  Besides, babies are adorable,
soft and often naked, so there's a natural comparison.  But I think the
sense of ownership -- one owns a baby, cares for it, provides for it --
probably led to the original usage from a man to a woman. Now, of course,
women call men "baby," too.  Oh, and there's also the thing about babies
being "sweet," and we use all sugary substances to refer to lovers:
honey, sugar, sweetie-pie, etc.

I'm actually really interested in studying pedophilia and the way it comes
up in our culture, but I don't think this is a case of that...especially
since most pedophiles prefer children, not infants.  If someone called
their lover "Little Girl" or "Daddy" or "Pre-Pubescent One," then maybe
there'd be something to go on.

Well, during turn of the century Mardi Gras in New Orleans, black
prostitutes dressed up as babies, which was considered pretty exciting
then, because -- of course -- they were showing their _legs_ in public.
The photographs are really extraordinary and the phenomenon continued
through World War II. I think there is an interesting sociological study
of this in Sam Kinser's 1990 book, but can't find it to confirm.  Hence,
perhaps "baby" as a sexual term.

Isn't there another year left of the 20th century? And therefore a year to go
to the new millenium also?

Here's some books I read in December:

Goya, Jean Francois Chabrun
Goya: The Disasters of War, DeSales/ Faure (mostly pictures)
Language and Politics, Noam Chomsky (interviews)
Capital of Pain, Paul Eluard
English Poems of George Herbert, George Herbert
Roderick Hudson, Henry James
Mesh, Clark Coolidge
Boston Common, M.A. DeWolfe Howe (local history; author is grand-uncle of
Susan
and Fanny)
Nationalism and Culture, Rudolf Rocker (one of the best books I've ever read)
also a turn-of-the-last-century anthology of Dryden, Byron, and Pope

or i might have called it "loose ends"---not entirely sure where this is
coming from, or for that matter where it's going, i.e., to whom it's
addressed in its entirety... but away we go...

---first, the few remarks i've seen hereabouts re _poetics@_ (ed. joel
kuszai), esp. vis-a-vis reference to kent johnson's piece on the poetics
list meltdown (which latter appeared a coupla issues back in _skanky
possum_)... since i've been (i guess) a primary "player" wrt the latter
"event," at least insofar as what i posted at the time, and what folks
posted me; and since the meltdown occurred, what, a calendar year ago; and
since i don't wish to dredge up all sortsa old biz:  let's just say it
SMARTS, still... i believe in fact it still smarts on all 'sides,' in all
'camps,' what have you... there's no way to get around the fact that
*everyone* involved said things they probably shouldn't a said (incl. moi,
and i apologize to one and all)... there's no way to get around the fact
that many of us miss (e.g.) henry gould, no matter what (if you will)
orneriness henry evinced... there's no way to get around the fact that many
of us hold charles bernstein and joel kuszai in high regard, no matter what
editorial (if you will) mistakes may have been made (b/c we view said
mistakes AS mistakes, and as democratic in character)... i esp. enjoyed
kent's interview with henry in the recent _jacket_---and this in spite of
the fact that i thought henry indulged in some oppositions that were as
provocative as the ones he attributes to charles (i don't find, personally
and e.g., that keeping one's rational brain intact need detract from more
spiritual and/or irrational poetic endeavor---and yes, i'm using shorthand
here...)...

[and btw:  would someone be so kind as to forward this post to henry?...
thanx in advance...]

there is (and this pace henry's musings re poetry in said interview, which
of course are not to be confused with his musings re poetics, or regarding
the poetics list---re which latter he chose, to his credit, not to beat to
death, as in 'dead horse') an ideological issue at stake in *any* public
endeavor, this list no exception... i might argue (i would) that i value
most highly that poetry that reaches beyond (e.g., and to pick yet another
point of recent contention around here) economic class issues by reaching
*through* such issues... i trust my construction here is not untidy---i
don't esp. enjoy writing that takes for granted ALL sortsa things, not
least of which is economic class... at the same time, if said writing does
not try to locate the (ever-changing) human and social and ineluctably
mortal aspect of life on planet earth (which of course includes all sortsa
spiritual inclinations), i'll probably walk away disappointed... but let's
not confuse things:  posting our little diatribes (mine esp.) to the
poetics list may only occasionally approximate a purely textual act... as
in this post, *this one*, which, however un/poetic, is meant to be rec'd
not as a poem, nor as conceptual art, but as an (what was it someone once
said about my posts? 'overweaningly earnest') appeal to other sentient
beings (strangers incl)... what makes alan sondheim's work intriguing
(regardless whether i respond to it aesthetically) is that his effort is
directed at redirecting the nature of *this* transaction... and when i aver
that this is not what *this* post is about, i would expect at least some of
you to work at least a quotient of this, my intention, into your receptive
grids...

all of which is to say:  ideology as such is, in addition to other things,
a matter of writing history, and history is, among other things, a fairly
messy affair requiring both the view from near, and the view from afar...
and there are numerous histories of this list (and others like it) yet to
be writ, which will no doubt require some real finesse, along with some
real re/searching...

---on a related note, this question of 'what the poetics list used to be'
vs. 'what it is now'... it's a question that mark p raised, i think---was
it three weeks or so ago?... in any case, as mark stated then, it DOES
appear as though the poetics list, at least under joel's careful editorial
eye, was more coherent, enabled a more sustained and focused conversation
c. 93-95, than it does today (even setting aside the new moderated format,
IF the latter may be set aside)... at the same time, i would like to
observe that the list had at its inception *many* fewer subscribers (and
fewer of these were women, as i recall)... yet in fact starting out small
is a good way to begin *any* list, in my view---preferably with some effort
directed at establishing a reasonably wide spread of social 'types'... ergo
my advice (if i may) would be to begin small, private or semi-private, in
anticipation of the inevitable splintering, spin-offs, disagreement, and
lack of focus that will likely follow... but in any case the point here is
that there are many more folks in these regions today than five years ago,
and that these regions are likely over time (not "naturally," but b/c of
our social conditions/displacements) to experience migration (of people, of
ideas, of alliances) that lead to a somewhat different form of
engagement... hence that us "old timers" (yuck) are bound to find ourselves
encountering a "new" and somewhat uncomfortable set of parameters (and
let's not forget that the internet in general has contributed to and is
symptomatic of all sortsa dire as well as sanguine developments lo these
past six years, both of private and public ilk, as both joel and charles
suggest in their intro/preface to _poetics@)...

also (and charles can back me up here) i anticipated a poetics list
meltdown a full six months before it happened... and my suggestion to
charles at the time (out of the blue, as it were) was to try to hold a
poetics@ f2f conference, to help allay what i took at that time to be
increasingly irreconcilable online differences... i say this NOT to credit
mself with foresight---i say this by way of indicating that there is only
so much (grief, frustration, hurt) these spaces can handle (imho), and that
sometimes a simple handshake [w/wink] can mitigate what would otherwise
require screens upon screens of typeface... now:  charles did not have the
time OR resources to hold said conference, and neither did/do i... but it's
worth considering the latter in terms of futures... hence i post it here,
by way of a proposal, something to chew over, perhaps collectively...

----finally, i feel compelled to render a precis here re, i guess i would
call it, institutional power:  i have of late, as many of you are aware,
fallen into what for me is an unprecedented position of academic good
fortune---a tenure-track job, teaching a 2/2 (for the uninitiated, that's
two courses/semester), at a carnegie I research institution... if you wish
to read just how lucky i have been, a full(er) account is available at

http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pmc/v010/10.1amato.html

and when i write "lucky," i write this in spite of having pulled every damn
string i could pull to land this job... and in spite of having had some
relatively powerful strings to pull... but fact is, there are just SO many
talented folks out there, some on this list, who deserve this job more than
me...

moreover, i'm teaching poetry workshops (lordy) as opposed to (primarily)
professional writing, which latter kept me busy for the past nine years...
i'm teaching b/c, to be candid about it, i believe it to be the best
alternative to just plain writing for a living (which is not to say i don't
bring a certain passion to the learning situation)... yes, i have to
publish in order to keep this job---i'm up for tenure (again) in two-three
years, and i need another book to cinch same (i.e., setting aside teaching
and service)... my writing is, therefore, completely bound up with my
44-yr-old sense of professional self, and my bread & butter... hence my
poetry undoubtedly reveals my institutional, professionalized status, in
ways i can *and* cannot imagine...

now, some would observe that this is not the most desirable way to conduct
one's writing life... that it would be far preferable not to be beholden to
ANY institution, least of all of the academic variety... that in fact my
work as a writer and thinker has in so many ways been "corrupted" by my
academic-institutional status... that if i were a laborer, e.g. (and my
choice of manual labor is hardly unmotivated), my work would somehow be
"purer," less complicit with the status quo of our (what was jacques's
convenient formulation?) 'left of center suburban-professional' world...

no doubt this is true, to some extent... and without wishing to fall into
the self-loathing academic/intellectual stance, i *do* in fact have
problems with academics, and with academic life... i have after all gotten
to this position w/o an ivy league pedi(de)gree, and w/o a trust fund... i
do after all represent a growing number of academics who have found it
difficult to find a life that is *not* institutionalized in some
undesirable ways, and who may yet wish to bring to academe---i.e., to our
postsecondary learning institutions---something of the kick-in-the-ass that
such institutions will likely need in order to become truly worthwhile
places of employment AND social change...

now i ask you:  is this really such a mysterious urge?... while i don't
mind being called to the floor to answer for my petit bourgeois longings
and blindnesses, i *do* take some exception to superficial
characterizations of my work as a poet-teacher, or teacher-poet, or
whatever...

ergo, and at the risk of appearing more than a bit self-indulgent, i would
like to submit that this is how i conceive of my new-found institutional
power, as it were... and further, that my poetry, whether directed to
members of the academic or non-academic tribes, and IF in fact it speaks to
my institutional status (and enjoys the empowerments attending thereto) is
conceived, on this end (i.e., in my head) as contributing to the sort of
engagement i've just outlined, (if i may, and this is most personal) one
rooted less in a thirst for knowledge per se than in a wandering toward (it
is to be hoped) wisdom...

just to set the idiosyncratic? record, if not straight, then at least
legible...

        As a small child in the Fifties, my Quebecois relatives used the
word "Baby-doll" to mean a woman's slip
        After the movie Baby Doll came out, they used to make a bi-lingual
sort of pun:  "Qu'elle est belle, ma baby doll en sa baby doll".
        ("How pretty she is, my baby doll in her baby doll".)
        Another pun along these lines referred to Pall Mall, the cigarette
that
was popular for a while among the same relatives because in Quebecois it
is
prounounced "Pas Mal"--"not bad".

        Years later, going to live in France, one found that the French
are endlessly essaying to root out that evil, the influence of
"Franglais", the corruption of French by Americanisms and Anglicisms.

        Often I thought of how In Joual (Quebecois), American and English
words became remade, so that they were a joking code you only understood
if you were (forcibly or not) bi-lingual.

        Among the strong, crowned with power, glory, history, language
becomes a power, a purity, that defines, limits and coerces. Its
weakness is that it must be protected.



        Among the
oppressed and humiliated, language becomes a secret code, filled with
jokes that may one moment ease a wound and at another cause one. It is a
signal of a fugitive existence, recognized and passed on, "signs" in the
street among the billboards . . .

Had a laugh at that one.
Made me think of a legendary Irish tv quiz show, Quicksilver, (often called
Thicksilver).
Some samples:
Q. What was Hitler's first name?
A. Heil

Q. Who is the Ayatollah?
A. A Ceili band.

(Out of respect for those who dislike explanation I won't mention that a
Ceili band alternates waltzes and traditional Irish dance music at a most
enjoyable rustic soiree termed a Ceili.  Likewise I must remain silent
about the Eye of Tullow Ceili band, only begetter of the confusion.)

The above may well be apocryphal, but here's one I heard with my very own
shamrock bedecked ears on Irish radio:
Q: What rock is so light it floats?
A: The moon.

* ...you get my drift. I am aware there are those who think this is a joke
about stupidity; I am not one of these. To me it is poetic, philosphic, and
mysterious. We shouldnt be too quick to leap to disparaging conclusions abt
ourselves.

I have heard many a joke abt the English (as one of whom I was intended by
birth) but never bridled.....Abt Canadians, too (as one of whom I intended
myself by citizenship), and abt Americans (as one of whom I intend myself
by proximity), also w/o bridling. I suppose my trouble is that I don't
identify strongly enough with any national group, to take such offense.
Billy, perhaps you might take consolation in the fact that it was a glass
of WATER.....David

Dear Poetics List,

My own addition to the tide of reading lists is just this;

_Not Me_ by Eileen Myles (She's very cute in the photo!)

_The Collected Books of Jack Spicer_ (Just finished this last night. I
liked it a lot too.)

_Poems_ Pier Paulo Pasolini, translated by Noman MacAfee (In places I can't
get inside it but in other places I can.)

_Selected Poems_ Ted Berrigan (only about 10 pages down but I like this also.)

I bought the bio of Mina Loy also but then left it in a friend's car.

Sincerely,

Marla

"Sting with a spatulate or lamelliform appendage apicodorsally; infradental
lamellae strongly developed, acutely dentate or spinose, the spines
sometimes as long as the propodeals."

(and if that wasn't enough t'get ya)

"Nuchal carina forming a broad uninterrupted curve across the posterior
extremity of the head; posterior surface lacking dark apophyseal lines; on
vertex, median groove absent or ill defined; petiole a transverse scale,

(this miraculous melos is from the taxonomies in the front of _The Ants_ by
Bert Hollander and Edward O. Wilson --- it seems to me that one wd have to
be a bit nuts to NOT read this as poetry ---- thereare many other parts of
the book that have a poetic punch but i think that taxonomies are perhaps
the best things in that respect)

December 1999 issue of ARTFORUM

(it's a "best of the 90s issue" so while there is a lot of stuff inside
there isnt a lot of discussion much of any of it --- theyve had a bunch of
different art critics pick their 10 favorites from the 90s, all of which
have to be covered on one page while another page shows small pictures of as
many as will fit --- there are also two page spreads for music books and
movies --- the things that stuck out for me in the art round ups were all
the bodies, lifesize, almost lifesize, more than life size with looks
ranging between very real to giant g i joe (i'm not sure i really like this
stuff a great deal but i was surprizsed i guess by how many people are
making these things) --- one crit mentions buffy the vampire slayer as an
exemplar of a new acting style --- the simpsons, porn, abject art, color
field paint coming round again --- good for reading in airports)


III.

_The TEENAGERS_ & _THE TWEENS_  by James Sanders

(two chapbook sized volumes, the latter a sequel or sorts ---- i think James
made about 10 of each and that's a shame as this stuff is great ---- the
teenagers features Teenagers (of course), The Blob, Harry Connick Jr. and
the Harry Connick Jr. Zombie, several Evil Robots, Wink Martindale, Robbie
Kenieval and Santa Claus moving thru pool parties, The Match Game, suburban
interiors and exteriors (maybe) --- thru out _The Teenagers_ all the poems
have a large ceasura roughly formed down the center of the page --- here's a
sample from that book (my best shot at reproducing the orthography))

The Future

     How long have      you been in love

   with the blob.       Ive been in love

 with the blob           since age 17.

     Have you ever       met the blob.

No, my mom              says she invited

       him over for           thanksgiving but I

    happen to know         she's lying. How

  do you know           she's lying. She's

    been in cahoots         with the blob

     for years now.        Why would your

   mom want to           be in cahoots

       with the blob.          The blob has

a sparkling personality.        Once I heard

   the blob took           his girlfriend for

   a tour of Napa      Valley. The blob

   won the tour         from being on ~Price

   is Right~. Really?        Yes. The blob

   won the Showcase         Showdown: he bet

11,590 and the       actual amount was 11,600

      so the blob         got both showcases

    because if you        come within less than

  $100 you get          both showcase. Maybe

   the blob just got          lucky? No, darling,

     lucky might get        you by on ~Wheel

         of Fortune~ but             you gotta have

   skills to succeed           on ~Price is

    Right~. Well what            about Plinko or

   that big spinning money        wheel that gets

  you into the showcase          shodown. Seems like

      those are mostly         luck and depend

    very little on             a broad consumer product

knowledge base. Dont      you think youre idealizing

         the blob just            a bit? No, I

        could tell you          tons of things

     about the blob,        tons of accomplishments

    that the blob             has accomplished. If

     youre in love           with the blob why

      dont you call           him up or email

    him or something?        Oh, i wouldnt ever

   dream of disturbing       him. The blob is

   a very busy and         important person. And

  hes very reclusive.        He lives a solitary

 life pacing back       and forth on his oriental

   rug in the fading         blue of winter

 evenings. Besides         he has a drinking

  problem. Its lonely         being the blob you

   know; you never        thought of that,though,

       did you, DID            YOU? ~Fade~.


(the sequel _The Tweens_ has some of the same characters and like _The
Teenagers_ has some artwork and diagrams and such things but it has no
ceasuras instead appearing for the most part as a narrow column full
justified down the center of the page --- "The Future" above is one of the
more linear of the pieces in that volume and this is (maybe) one of the more
disjunct in _THE TWEENS_)


26.

We do double. What is that
moment?  The minotaur will
walk right through us with icy
circles.
     We giggled and soon
           after
water



   slapped

                                   mind
                       at the center.
Our brief instant
of phases like white shoes in
a question
 the cuts the inside of luggae
or a cursor in a sandwich in a
yellow  suspension  of  the
world.
            It was listening
            a tooth
among      strangers.      You
wonder why the Mummy had
a     personal   life   and   the
minotaur to some extent, but
not Harry Connick Jr.      We
describe it as   "the unknown
body".  No  longer  does  the
spectacle of the "either-or"
posture
                    white dust. and
they no longer wagged and
the
  Mummy,  subjunctive  and
foamed with our clear paired
boo boos from encounters.
"Let's go"     A time
blob.  We said weariliy
 in the diner
                    they had to
take shrewd loitering
                   in the immense
perhaps.
We realize time is running
out but some zeros, almost
word for word,
       dialed

                          might blob
resucked into
              like a clown
                              gripped
both

sides of the rim of recent
things with a blank.
     We will strand as much of
him as any other and lay over
everywhere,               and the
neck

       liquid

                         ear apart by
   skipping for joy through the
endured
They told us what we already
knew: that there was no other
minotaur
                               over the
phone,
or that it was public,
      attached to the silhouette
                       of a robot.
      Our soft unformed
      on
 the shag

years.
                           instincts

  that nobody
gown,
at the card table
                     behind      the
Payless
 Shoe Store.  We may
                          never have
seen
  them.   We showed
up. We automatically       the
boney
        goomy                  was
endangered of becoming the
dummy, not yet a match for
it, what we foresaw that the
encounter, clustered by the
minotaur's secret aisles like
baloons of pink jello.     Or
Santa searched the box.


IV.

_Queen of Angels_ by Greg Bear

(pretty cool sci-fi novel with poets, poetry, murder, internal "mindscapes",
voodoo, human reformation, cops/detection, hints of strange sex, vinegar
baths, future social hierachies imagined, art, AI, remote exploration of
another planet, ethical questions about human behavior and the idea of
punishment, all that and los angeles in the 22nd C. --- Bear has some fun
with language as well, using his many coinages without much explanation,
puncuating non-sentences with periods, ending without punctuation sometimes,
letting sentences start and not finish --- a fun read and it was just right
somehow for sleeping on the floor in my mother's apartment)


V.

_Time's Arrow and Archimede's Point_ by Huw Price

interesting so far --- he's concerned to question why so many basic physical
properties are asymetrical, time, radiation, etc and he promises in the
opening that by trying to conceive of a point outside time one cd imagine a
symetrical viewpoint on these seemingly asymetrical forces and he also says
that given this view that many of the puzzling things about quantum
mechanics will become less puzzling and more what one might have expected
given a way to bracket our own temporally biased--asymetrical perspective

"huw price is reader in philosophy at the u. of sydney australia and fellow
of the australian academy of humanities. author of _facts and the function
of truth_ and many articles in journals such as _jou.of philosophy_ _mind_
_nature_"

i hadnt known or remembered that the 2nd law of thermodynamics was based on
statistical probabilities --- and as he presents the issue it does seem
curious that from any state of affairs that the stats wd seem to indicate
that entropy wd increase in either direction past/future -- from this he
moves to say that it isnt the increase of entropy in the future that needs
explaining, its the decrease in entropy toward the past

all of this is building out of work done by others on something called "the
block universe" a theory i was totally ignorant of but which is very curious
to think about -- it grants time full status as a dimension stating that our
sense of the objective present and the flow of time are actually subjective
--- there are also some hints that causality will be looked at in this
atemporal perspective, which is really twisting my head a bit



VI.

_Imagining Language_ ed. McCaffery and Rasula

(i wrote the list about this previously --- it's still great --- probably my
favorite book this year (as last year's was _REVERSIBLE
DESTINY, We Have Decided Not To Die_  Arakawa/Gins --- i still read in this
a lot too) )





music

Becks new one "Midnight Vultures" is sly and funny and great ass shaking
music

vol.1 of the Magnetic Fields "69 love songs" --- good pop songcraft with
kinks

"From Here to Eternity Live" the compiled live CLASH album --- this is
fucking great and for any even small fan essential

Double Nickels on the Dime" The Minutemen's best release, old now but i love
it (d.boon is my hero, r.i.p.)

I come over all mustache-and-beard, once I'd had a butcher's at this chain
and fetter, and had to go up the apples and pears and lie down on my Uncle
Ned. It gave me ideas of deference, aroused my glass royalty, and punctured
my plaster and beam, until in the river bend I found it ghostly expensive
so I hashish-and-pot off a sausage and toast of my own to pound-and-ounce
my imminent removal. Let that dettol-and-bleach them a vegetable Wesson, I
fiddled-and-voted in splash-and-wallow haw humph. But then I thought, Who
was the Jeff and Mutt, who the fish dinner, in the throttles and chokes I
had fungus-and-mold? Was the singer and dancer, he there, or Hi there?

Yes; 1999 was the 99th year of the twentieth century and the 999th year of
the millennium; and we are now in the 100th and 1000th years respectively;
but people become really quite aggressive if you point it out.

thanks for this great post, the use of these words has troubled me for some
time, being a lover of the blues, where baby, mama, honey child, etc. are
used constantly.
but i suppose, as with all words, the intent with which they are said is
more relevant than what is said.

ps what is the url of the entymology site?

Hi Jacques,

Just wanted to say hi and to note your comment on the list, which I thought
very insightful.

> mainstream poetry is fascinating to me in that it is, in several ways, in
a profound state of crisis, while simultaneously seeming to be incredibly
complacent (or "lukewarm" as brian puts it)--a crisis, in other words, as
much *of* as *in* complacency.  for the readers of mainstream poetry--& such
readers have, by definition, a casual relationship to poetry--poems are
almost entirely about "soul making" (thus, bill moyers)--& register the
(fairly circumscribed) dissastisfactions, aspirations, & values of the most
completely socialized segment of the american population (left-of-center,
suburban college-educated professionals).

I think people got confused by "soul-making" -- or at least your one
respondant.  But this idea of the state of crisis in "mainstream" poetry
could have many factors, one of which is that the glory days of this
"mainstream" -- Lowell, Berryman, Bishop, etc. -- still maintained some very
close ties to modernism and its myths, not to mention the figures of
modernism in their presence (Thomas, Auden, Stein a little bit even, the
ever-looming Pound, Eliot, and even Williams for those like Jarrell who
accepted him).  They could derive some excitement from that, and feel a part
of the "age of anxiety" even if in socially unchallenging teaching jobs.
Now, that thrill is to be found in their own peers whom they, by nature,
have to ignore -- i.e. "us," the so-called experimental wing (whose
predecessors took them to task, though not as "citizens" but as artists,
which isn't nearly as effective [this could be reversed -- artists rather
than citizens?).  And we have to ignore them -- ignore people like Ammons
who, though "boring" often, is as much an inheritor of Williams and, say,
the poetics of Thoreau as Howe would want to be, only different.  Anyway,
this is a willed blindness that, until now, has been generally bought into.
Does this make sense?  Though it seems a minor blindness, in that it only
concerns the realm of the literati, it's really, I think, not -- how can we
choose to ignore those who loom so large in our world and yet pretend to
have anything amounting the "vision"?  Even Blake, the most outside,
challenged Reynolds on very intellectual grounds, as did Williams/Eliot --
these are dialectics, in a way, that create the sensation of movement.
There are other factors, of course.

> 2.  alternative poetries are not diametrically dissimilar to mainstream
poetry, but actually share/reproduce many of the symptoms of this
crisis-in-complacency.  this is not, however, necessarily a *bad* thing
inasmuch as it might be more useful & interesting for poetry to make the
symptoms of capitalism, etc. *exemplary* rather than to propose
"alternatives" or "solutions".

Not quite sure what you mean here.  Sort of: that we should take the fact,
the symptoms, of this complacency as a sort of content, especially since
it's a key into larger social scales.

> 3.  for example, silliman's "solution" of a more locally-oriented poetic
strikes me actually as extremely, if unintentionally, conservative.  for one
thing, it would tend, of course, to leave in place the status quo
ideological
& aesthetic assumptions of more ambitiously positioned poetries like
language
(not coincidentally).  this is particularly evident for instance w/ the more
noticeably regional poetic groupings like apg--  which, although it produces
interesting work, is in an extremely unoriginal position vis langpo--or
boston, on the other hand, which is largely frozen in an olsonian aesthetic.
what exp poetry needs is in fact an "outside" -- an alternative, just for a
start, to all the *puffing* that constitutes the critical discourse (for
what
it's worth) that surrounds it.  indeed, rather than the chaos of
proliferating books & presses, the reception of alt poetry & its
relationship
to its audience seems more & more regulated by networks of affiliation
structured by a.) apprentiships by emerging poets to more established
writers
& b.) accreditation/initiation in/by graduate writing &/or english depts at
buffalo, brown, naropa, san diego, etc.

A little lost here when it comes to the conceptual stuff (the analysis seems
pretty accurate): I guess the idea is of the "outside" -- which of course
you put in scare quotes.  I tend to think that the idea of an "outside"
still suggests a sort of purity of vision that, at base, has a metaphysical
foundation, and once having that, would have to be examined deeply and
conclusively -- which any of us are free to do.  I rather like the idea of
there being a constant soiling or corrupting of this purity, that there is
no outside but running among the corridors of the "inside," either as
criminal or mystified adolescent or what-not, is quite interesting, a
possibly anarchic, possibly very invisible activity.  That is, if you choose
to remain "inside" but never create a vocabulary for how you are operating
there -- selectively silent, selectively lying or stealing, selectively
dead-on, etc. -- this may be the closest you come to creating a system that
can't be subsumed.  If you are talking more realistically (i.e. "realism"),
about where a poet does her work, I find I hardly think about that now that
I am out of school, working unhappily, making no money from poetry.
Unfortunately the outside is the inside in this case.  Anyway, where would
you find this "outside"?  Is it something that can be rationalized?

As for the local, I feel like the term is too loaded right now to know what
it means -- I could venture based on how/what Silliman writes, but is what
O'Hara was doing writing the "local"?  Isn't A.R. Ammons writing the
"local"?  Isn't the local in terms of New York something of a tradition now
that becomes commodified (or taken as a sign of "purity"), and couldn't one
say the "local" in Atlanta becomes manifest in the very fact of it's
becoming a sort of ghost double of some of the gestures of language poetry
(in this way, I read Miles Champions' investigations of language poetics a
sign of his confronting the "local" of London -- by creating the
non-local -- a sort of gesture to the ephemeral nature of much language
writing by granting some poems the air of permanent form, hence, satisfying
a peculiarly English need for form that responds to class and other social
issues, the need for "art," while at the same time accessing peculiarly
alien meanings, etc. etc.)

> 4.  poetry, both mainstream & avant-garde, has become a minor genre in
almost
every respect.  it is, for instance, telling that so few of the poets
writing
in the contributors's notes of fence magazine, when prompted to name their
favorite books, mention poetry books.  even the way the word is pronounced
--po *em* --with the stress on the second syllable-- seems to attest to its
anachronism.  perhaps one could/should begin again by writing *pomes.*

This is a depressing thought, of course.  But I don't know how minor it is,
actually -- if we consider it more glorified several decades ago, then why
do Kenneth Rexroth's essays on "Poetry in 1965" and "Poetry in 1970" sound
like they could have been written today?  I think we don't have a heck of
lot of ideas these days, if that means anything. But I wonder what the
proliferation of good ideas would do to poetry -- would it really help.  Is
the idea of the "liberal ironist" (in Rorty's phrase) just not as
interesting as the "ubermensch" -- is there something inherently unexciting
about liberal democracy as we know it?  This sounds like a stupid question,
but I wonder what people are offering as alternatives when they imagine the
world of poetry today as being a bunch of over-tolerant, intellectual,
self-serving, rather unreflective automatons (I'm exaggerating for
effect) -- i.e. liberals -- is this a call for more violent, egotistic,
spontaneous, and intolerant poets?  In Rortian terms again: how to we
achieve scale, the effects of the sublime, without inflicting cruelty?

Cheers,
Brian

Subject:      Re: Questions about Gould Interview
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I read the interview with Henry Gould yesterday, out of curiosity since I
don't know much about him except for a brief essay in Witz (on stanzas, I
think that was him), and because, alas, he has been "banned" from the list.
I wasn't on the list back then, haven't read @poetics nor the archives
(don't particularly care to, actually, since it's only been described as an
unfortunate event, and no doubt cannot be of "objective" interest to anyone
for a
number of years), so I could hardly comment on that. My general question
about the interview, though (and this may be directed toward people who know
Gould very well, care for his work, etc.), is: what does the interview
actually say, i.e. what positive statements does it put forth? I think there
are a lot of interesting gestures within it:
for example (these are based on one reading and having the print-out next to
me right now), the framing of the questions, with requirements to include
names of people or concepts, gave the proceedings something of a
tug-and-pull quality, which was pretty weird but fun, but I suppose a lot of
fun to do (was this done over the phone, in person? that might help). This
sort of activity conveys a tone and mood which has its content -- like a
Oulipian
game of sorts, along with the puns. I
also felt that Kent Johnson was sort of trying to lead HG into some sort of
more direct (say, polemical) statements about the list, about Language
poetry, and about being "banned" -- this seems to me quite obvious -- and
yet HG seemed to want to deflect this, even at the risk of not fulfilling
all of the requirements of the question. This isn't to say that HG doesn't
in fact indulge in a bit of, say, polemic, but that it didn't (when it did
appear) seem to be in response to what KJ was asking. For example, there
was a question about "depth" early on, which lead HG, after mentioning
Beth Anderson's essay "Imperturbable Things," to conclude that if "you
piggyback poetry on the hump of rationalized materialism, you've provided it
with a critical pseudo-answer rather than an answer drawn from its own
(poetic) depths." I think even this brief quote from HG's reply raises for
me a number of problems -- for instance, in the phrase "rational
materialism," what is the meaning of the word "rationalism"? Is there
another type of materialism, say a "mystical" or "spiritual" materialism"?
The word materialism, of course, seems to suggest something along the line
of "dialectical materialism," e.g. Marxism, and from Marxism you go to
Hegel, for whom the word "spirit" had a very special meaning (which survives
into Adorno) -- I won't venture a definition my self, but it has something
to do with the thesis/antithesis dialectic by which historical periods are
able to feel their own movement, their contingency but their approach to the
eternal as well, the eschatological. Anyway, I am wondering if, here, there
is any particular reason to use the term "rational" with "materialism,"
especially if the term is being used in opposition to the statement: "...
Barbara Guest has used no hooks, and this has allowed her to create a
textually saturated and satisfying poetry that embodies the transient, the
ephemeral, the flickering in translucent surfaces that we
call painterly for lack of a term to chart the
refusal of a pseudo-depth of field that remains a ghostly presence in much
of the poetry of our time." It seems to me that this statement is not, in
fact, a statement grounded in any firm sense of the efficacy of
"rationality" -- rationality, as an absolute (grounded either in the
mathematical certainties of Plato's Timaeus or the religious certainties of
Kant, or the abstract certainties of Science or the historically-ordained
certainties of the State), is not being referred to here as referee in
determining the qualities of this "poetic" writing, but rather (in my
opinion) a rather contingent form of humanism, which is to say a humanism
that itself doesn't refer to a higher authority but recognizes the
provisionality -- in some sense, the irrationality -- of its own language.
Is could someone "rationally" praise the "transient, ephemeral, flickering"
qualities of
someone's work -- isn't the idea of "rationality" predicated on
clear terms, on eternal forms for thinking (i.e. "final vocabularies")?
Then there is a description of some sort of "ghostly
presence in the poetry of our time" -- it doesn't seem that a "rational"
writer would want to mention the fact of ghosts (unless religion played a
very firm role in the rational system). Maybe I'm taking the word
"rational" too much to heart, but it seems to be used pejoratively
in this context, and yet it seems to have been a project of poets
and philosophers for some time to investigate this very term (Raymond
Williams devotes three full pages to it in Keywords, right between
Radical and Reactionary, which get less.) [Note: Were the
Surrealists "rational" or "irrational"?] Actually, now that I look at it
closer, I realize that HG seems to build a similar sort of
structurally-threatened platform on Beth Anderson's essay, which didn't
strike me (in my dim memory of it) as being particularly "rationalist" or
"materialist" (but I'll reread it tonight). HG says (writes?):

[Anderson] looked at some "painterly" poems by Stevens, Guest & others from
standpoint maybe similar to Bernstein here [in his introduction to Guest's
reading]. The idea [or the "premise," one presumes] is that poetry is a
progressive force for a demythologized, egalitarian materialism - by
analyzing and rejecting all forms of idealizing/poeticizing rhetoric. I
thought it [not sure which piece of writing he means here] was really
well-written, though I disagreed with its premises all the way through.
Maybe if you take these premises to the limit, as Bernstein tries to do, it
can be understood as "revolutionary": in a rationalist post-Enlightenment
sense, uprooting all remnants of antique, medieval and romantic spiritual
"aura" around language on behalf of the demystified human will. So Bernstein
& others attach themselves to abstract expressionism in painting (doing away
with the "hooks"), to deconstruction in criticism (doing away with the
"aura"), and will round up any stray calves in the field of outsider &
marginal art (even if those strays are from a different ranch) to forward
this project.

[On my second read-through, I realize there's a problem here. In his
summation of Anderson's essay, he seems to be describing the conclusion of
her writing, not the premise -- i.e. that poetry should or could be a
progressive force were it to "analyze and reject.. etc." However, he refers
to this idea as the "premise," which suggests that the idea is that poetry
is, and always is despite its particular features, this progressive force,
and by extension that it always is "analyzing and rejecting all forms...
etc." If it is that latter, then the conclusions based on these premises
haven't been stated. Etc. etc.]

There seems to me quite a lot of ideas to unpack here, but I would like to
ask some questions about what he means. For instance, when he writes of a
"demythologized, egalitarian materialism," is he talking about a state of
thinking, an essentially private state of thinking about the world (i.e.
Nietzschean irony, "god is dead," Kierkegaardian self-creation, one's
attachment to his or her dog, one's interest in wearing make-up to parties)
or a physical social creation, i.e. if this poetry is written, the State
will be transformed into something we can describe as embodying the
principles of "demythologized, egalitarian materialism." That is, is he
describing poetry as a "progressive force" for certain private world-view
(can one be "progressive" about a private world-view, like Jehovah's
Witnesses?), or is he classing it with movements such as Marxism or
Anarchism which sought/seeks to change social structures. If it is the
latter -- one sense, granted the spin he puts on the statements, that it is
-- then is it really the society of the State that he is writing about, or
some other society like that of the "world of letters"? Where is this
"demythologized, egalitarian materialism" supposed to exist? Consequently,
what does the binary that HG establishes here -- on the one
side is the "demythologized, egalitarian", on the
other side, the "idealizing and poeticizing" rhetoric -- imply? It's
probably not
worth while pursuing the term "poeticizing" since, for me at least, it's
always been a very ineffective verb -- it just doesn't seem to mean much (I
guess it's "anesthetizing" with a persuasive edge, such as "He poeticized
what existence in Greenland for us would be like so that I would go there
with him" -- i.e. it seems to suggest adding an attractive exterior to
something that is otherwise mundane or unattractive, the very opposite of
poetry to me). But idealizing raises a lot of issues, at least in
relationship to the words "idealist" and "ideal." Actually, does it have a
relationship to those words -- which suggest the idea of permanence, of the
possibility of perfect good, and the individual striving for it -- or is it
as distant from "ideal" as poeticize is from "poetry"? Presuming that it
isn't so distant (and, if you want, that poeticize is very close to poetry,
or to what poet's are supposed to do), then why is "idealize" held up in
opposition to "egalitarian"? Weren't many of the "ideals" of the Romantic
movement the idea (spiritually confirmed by Hegel later on) concerned with
egalitarianism, the God-given truth (hence eternal) that all people were
created equal, etc? Since we are dealing with binaries, would we find the
opposite of "egalitarian" to be "authoritarian" and/or "hierarchical" (class
wise, meritocracy, "poetocracy") -- if that's the case, then why not just
say it (to avoid confusion)? (I.e. if you're not a liberal, what are you?)
Looking at this a bit closer, I would ask whether one could have a
"demythologized materialism" -- is materialism, or has it ever been,
"mythologized"? If it has been mythologized, i.e. fetishized (though
non-anthropomorphically, as we must assume) as the defining factor of the
movement of "spirit" in history -- is HG then saying that Bernstein and
Anderson have a goal to demythologize this reading of materialism?

There are other parts to this paragraph I have questions about. For
instance, HG writes that "Bernstein and others" attach themselves to
Abstract Expressionism. It would be enough to ask where any substance
exists to the claim that Bernstein felt any particular fondness for Abstract
Expressionism, or whether he felt it was useful to him (he tends to write
more of people like Arakawa/Gins and people in the constructivist/dadaist
axis, as his peers like Watten have stuck to other conceptualists like
Smithson, Burden, etc.). But moreso (and this is trickier, but there is
substance to it): has any literary movement, or group, ever actually
benefited from a relationship to Abstract Expressionism, or even
particularly acknowledged it as leading them to their respective
discoveries? (It seems to me that Ashbery didn't particularly like them, at
least the males, O'Hara was a great fan but used it mostly early in his
development [when he was equally imitating Joyce and thousands of others],
and Schuyler, who was very much into the "cult of paint" of New York nearly
always had a closer affinity to Fairfield Porter and certain types of
landscape painting, as did F O'H.) Consequently, why would anyone want to
"attach themselves to Abstract Expressionism" for the sake of the goal of
"uprooting all remnants of antique, medieval and romantic spiritual 'aura'
around language on behalf of the demystified human will." Was that Pollock
what was doing -- isn't it, in fact, the exact opposite? Didn't the shapes
and magnificence of religious iconography, not to mention the splendor of
the clashes of color that one witnesses in cathedrals, inform much of the
scale of the project, and wasn't putting the gesture of the individual, the
man, in the middle of it creating a "mystification" of the human will all
the more? (This is
thumbnail interpretation right now.) Imagining the Abstract Expressionists
as inheritors of the Surrealist project, is the image of the human psyche
they present more or less mystified? And what is HG suggesting the "hooks"
are here -- does he mean figuration? So is the sum of his statement here:
the Abstract Expressionists did away with using figuration and narrative in
their paintings because they felt they created religious and idealist
subtexts to their work concerning the human will and provided ease of
viewing by a popular audience, and this provided Bernstein and his friends
at the time with the idea of taking figuration and narrative out of their
poems, in their similar goal of doing away with religious conceptions of
mankind and the nature of the will." Well, there are many ways one can take
this (it doesn't sound too bad now, but needs work), but it seems to me that
Freud had pretty much "demystified" the human will -- at least
divorced it from any ideas of elective salvation, indivisible structure,
eternal qualities, "essences," etc. -- and created the context for the
great jokes that we, the ironic artists that succeeded
his and others' battles with metaphysics, can make regarding it, and that
the
Abstract Expressionists -- who were, as the name suggests "expressionists,"
not constructivists (i.e. concerned with the agonic will) -- were not very
ahead in that game, and in fact rendered the conceptual (or "rational")
component of art further "medieval" with their work.

I feel I could go on -- this essay is chock-full of phrases that don't seem
to add up, but probably could with a little work. For example, what's a
"rationalist post-Enlightenment" sense? Does he mean, perhaps, the
particular spirit of rationality (or the claim to rationality) of
post-Structuralists? Is it "deconstruction" that Benjamin claims "did away
with the aura" in art? If the "aura" in art is the sense of its permanence,
it's one-of-a-kindness, it's presence in the eternal frame of a history and
scale of values, wasn't this "aura" being "done away with" long before
deconstruction? Does Bernstein, in this statement, or in his poetry, ever
actually "deconstruct" meaning (or make any claims that meaning is so
entirely textual that it can't be found and kicked around) or does he
"ironize" it (i.e. highlight its contingencies when it is masquerading as
permanence -- "psuedo-depth-of-field")? What's the difference, here,
between Enlightenment rationality and post-Enlightenment rationality, and
does it matter for the sake of this particular argument?

Anyway, I only ask these questions -- rather long-windedly, I confess -- for
the sake of showing that this interview has significance in regards to its
contexts (HG's personal context, for example, in anticipation of his new
book, or the state of poetry discourse as its carried out among "us", or the
state of why we claim not to be very well understood by others, the state of
the list), in terms of larger (or maybe smaller, if you think this trite)
frames of discourse that are of interest to people not personally involved
(philosophically, politically "from a different ranch" [does he mean "race"
here?]), in the way interviews can serve to entertain or project ideas, etc.
I'm approaching it as a sort of Curious George (a touch of mischief, of
course, but really trying to understand what's going on here) -- I'm
not a trained philosopher, kind of a dilettante, and have no doubt screwed
up much of
the above. There's a lot of interesting language in the interview,
I feel, and interesting gestures within it,
but I can't help feeling, myself, that it needs "unpacking" before it is to
be "understood" -- which isn't to say it has to be "rational" by any means
(whatever rational means, of course), just a little more nuanced, so that
it's rhetoric doesn't brush so roughly -- perhaps just "clearer" so the
reader can trust that he's not always going for laughs and easy kills. But
that's just my opinion, I'm sure many of you who know him know what he means
by these things. Any idears? (Please forward this if you'd like.)

Can these two be separated so neatly? As I've been gardening rather than
reading, I haven't the energy to explore this point. Those in the northern
hemispere making "good use of this winter" might respond - I'd also question
privileging intent over 'what is said' - does this mean content? if so,
content and intent are only a piece of the picture. (metaphors come in handy
when you're feeling lazy).

In relation to the 'baby' etc terminology, this attitude seems precisely the
wall many of us have bashed our heads on over the years - people (to be
suitably vague) will claim that because a word is used with the best of
intentions (as gauged by the user)it cannot be offensive. I feel that this
is such a familiar argument I don't need to spell it out.

As this is my first posting to the list since the New Year, I wish all the
best to everyone. I am unsentimental (I think), the new year has no great
significance and 2000 isn't the first year of the millenium, as I understand
it, but, on Saturday, watching more TV than I usually do, the worldwide
coverage of dancers, musicians, acrobats, just people, the spirit that
seemed abroad was unusually moving. I find faith a huge leap, impossible
really, but there were glimpses of what it can be like that day. Already a
memory rather than an experience.

i think you are right on about that, esp in the US women are abnormally

Been reading these last few months:

VEXT, Aldon Nielsen--first book of poetry I took up after several month
hiatus; clicked and clicked and clicked, and I turned on again.  Many
Thanks, Aldon!
MEDIEVAL, Steven Farmer--Here's one brims with substance, authenticity;
will see more and more of these.
THE LAST AVANT-GARDE, David Lehman--Have commented earlier.
PARADISE, Ron Silliman (re-re-readin)--never seems to fail me.
THE LION BRIDGE, Michael Palmer--Selected 1972-1995.  Wow, yep!
FIRST INTENSITY, #12--including Bromige, Ratcliffe, yep.
TRIPWIRE, #2--another purchased "then," readin now, and liking, e.g.,
Bellamy, Cabri, Toscano, for starters.
BLACK BOX CUTAWAY, Susan Gevirtz--Glides on infinite sheets of poise;
"crosstalk," "attentuation," "line noise," no, so clean packets
throughout.
"Eight Untitled Sonnets," by Elizabeth Willis (in HOW2, I
think)--fabulous! Genuine, and genuinely refreshing.
Poetry by Pam Rehm (must go find again, indeed)--amazing sophistication;

again, a quality and depth of "substance," or whatever, too.  Especially

enamored of the discipline to follow/pursue object relations dimensions,

depths, whatever, and through an endlessly intriguing house of
"mirrors."

ive been told by an animal behaviorist that humans are prematurely born,
and that that accounts for some of our mating behavior like kissing, or
erotic attraction to the female breast, which is not found in other parts
of the mammalian kingdom or even among our cousin primates.  this wd
account for all manner of regressive behavior during courtship rituals,
including mutual infantilization through rhetoric.

Okay, I'm one of the silent lurkers here, I admit (not because I haven't
enjoyed the issue, but because I feel I'm still digesting it & didn't feel I
was at a point where I was ready to make any sort of serious "response"--
certainly to the list-- other than talking about it w/ a couple friends.
But I'll take this (belated) opportunity to thank Kevin & Dodie for
_generously_ offering copies to the list, & to definitely recommend the
issue to anybody who hasn't seen it.  The issue underscores, I think, the
importance (which Ron Silliman pointed to) of the local.  Those of us who
are in localities with (that is, in contact with) other poets should
definitely give some thought to the role of the local in shaping (or perhaps
more accurately: being a CATALYST for) both poetry & poetics.  & Perhaps
I'll have more to say on this later....

I write:
I'm curious how you mean "most completely socialized." I think of college
education to be a process of DE-socialization in some ways. While certain
values are passed on, higher education in many fields also includes
considerable meta-knowledge, knowledge which in typical postmodern fashion
creates (or should create) a certain critical self-awareness of one's own
culture and assumptions. A simple example would be comparing high school
history (heros and patriots) to college history (murderers and slavers).
What I'm saying is that, at least in my own experience, college is a place
that breaks down a person's modernist ideas, rather than building them.

I assume, however, that you are refering to those who are more business
oriented (vs academics) and/or who still cling to dead metanarratives like
"the american dream". These are the people who read Jewel...?

I've been reading Bin Ramke of late, and I think my particular fondness for
him derives from the way he seems to be aware of this modern-postmodern
tension. He can take a positivist, modernist narrative or image and slip
under it to find its dark lining. Reading to your child at bedtime becomes a
darkly manipulative act. Science and education become liars. How marvelous.

Hi

Like it or not, this is a joke about stupidity, or to be precise, about a
racial/racist stereotype about the stupid Irish. A long tradition of such
dating back to Gerald of Wales, through Spenser and on to Punch cartoons.
Part of the colonial past. And there it should stay.

A question: would the moderator have allowed this through if the protagonist
were Afro-American? A woman? Jewish? If not, why was this considered OK?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hassen--I'm more inclined to imagine that women shaving has its roots more
in inflating (so-called) differences between the sexes than in returning
them to a little-unhairy-girl state as a pedophilic fetish.  I think that
even a shaved, naive, little-girl-acting woman wouldn't be especially
attractive to a true pedophile: it's just not the genuine article, and
pedophilia seems to be about that first and foremost.  I don't think men
dressing up as babies and getting spanked is related to pedophilia,
either...

A side note: not long ago I had, linked to my site, an essay on the curious
lack of a NAWGLA (when we've got a NAMBLA, which I support).  It was
questions-n-theory based, as I'm not a girl-lover myself (although it did
contain a admiring reference to Judith Vittet, who plays Miette in *The City
of Lost Children*).  Among other things, I was interested in the way that
age-of-consent laws can be used homophobically; I'd just seen on one trashy
news show or another a story about a young (14, actually--not in the
"accepted" "pedophilia" range, which goes to 12, 13 max.) woman with an
older (late twenties) female lover.  The 14-yr-old had instigated the
relationship, was perfectly happy with it, etc., but when it was found out,
the cops were called and spent much of the show giving her the ol' "You
realize what that lady did to you was BAD" and "That woman is a very
confused lady" & "You were taken advantage of, you know" schtick, because
they refused to acknowledge even the possibility that a 14-yr-old could
choose to enter a lesbian relationship.  At any rate, the girl's only care
was that her lover not be harmed or arrested, which the cops of course
promised, just about the time their cop buddies were harming and arresting
the lover.  In my own life I've seen a friend, 24, lose his lover, 16, to
age of consent rules resorted to as a legal means of "trying to make our son
straight" (No Date, Go Straight chimes in my ear).

The NAWGLA site generated tons of mail, none from folks angry about the
site.  I deleted it because most people wanted something more than theory
(My goodness!  What's WRONG with those people who want more than THEORY?
said the academic), and redirected those who had written to more appropriate
(it's all relative) sites.

That's my two cents on pedophilia.  If this becomes a thread, we should
maybe watch it/be careful, as many folks, I imagine, do not want to hear
about this, or at least don't come to poetics to do so.

best,
em

Thought I'd offer some response to this wonderful dialogue of Brian's &
Jacques':

According to Brian Stefans:
>
> Now, that thrill is to be found in their own peers whom they, by nature,
> have to ignore -- i.e. "us," the so-called experimental wing (whose
> predecessors took them to task, though not as "citizens" but as artists,

> who, though "boring" often, is as much an inheritor of Williams and, say,
> the poetics of Thoreau as Howe would want to be, only different.  Anyway,
> this is a willed blindness that, until now, has been generally bought into.

One way to look at what an Ammons is doing vis a vis WC Williams is
through this historical analogy.  In 1851, on the heals of Daniel
Webster's negotiation of the Fugitive Slave Law "compromise," Emerson gave
one of his most vitriolic anti-slavery speeches, in which he made this
keen observation regarding Webster's on-going celebration of "democracy":

"He [Webster] praises Adams and Jefferson, but it is a *past* Adams and
Jefferson his mind can entertain.  A present Adams and Jefferson he would
denounce.  So with the eulogies of liberty in his writings - they are
sentimentalism and youthful rhetoric."

Likewise, Ammons entertains a past WCW - those aspects of his work that
have already been assimilated comfortably by a very large portion of the
culture - the chattiness, the more facilely (as opposed to riskily)
improvisational.  But of course there's still much in Williams's work
which continues to risk something unknown, and with this, as far as I can
see from a work like GARBAGE, Ammons has no truck.  The point being,
Williams is experimental precisely for the things Ammons can't accomodate.
This reminds me of something I just read in Adorno’s *Aesthetic Theory*:

"That aesthetics, in its desire to be more than chatter, wants to find its
way out into the open, entirely exposed, imposes on it the sacrifice of
each and every security that it has borrowed from the sciences; no one
expressed this necessity with greater candor than the pragmatist John
Dewey....The openess of artworks--their critical relation to the
previously established, on which their quality depends--implies the
possibility of complete failure, and aesthetics alienates itself from its
object the moment that by its own form it deceives on this score.  That no
artist knows with certainty whether anything will come of what he does,
his happiness and anxiety, which are totally foreign to the contemporary
self-understanding of science, subjectively registers something objective:
the vulnerability of all art. The insight that perfect artworks scarcely
exist brings into view the vanishing point of this vulnerability"  (AT
353-4).

It’s interesting that when he gets to the aesthetic Adorno appeals to
Dewey, in this context especially since Dewey is such an important
theoretical source for WCW’s experimentalism.  Which brings me to my next
point, regarding this issue of the local.  Brian has this to say in
response to Jacques and thinking of Silliman:

Brian may be right that "the local" is too loaded - i.e. worn out - as a
term, at least for the moment.  But it’s worth pointing out that Williams’
local has very little to do with "local color" – it’s much closer to
Dewey’s "local" which, as a concept, allowed him to a) privilege a
multi-ethnic "American Idiom" and b) to treat "whatever happens in the
course of writing as revelation," as Duncan once put it.  The emphasis
here is on *whatever* - sure, Ammons let’s some stuff in that, say, Donald
Justice of Mary Jo Salter wouldn’t.  But what does that matter to me or
thee when compared to all the possibilities which, in the act of writing,
clearly don’t qualify as "poetry" to him?  This is where Brian’s
speculation about the Atlanta poets’ "local" or Miles Champion’s "local"
becomes really interesting – since the local is en-acted in Champion’s
work (I’m hypothesizing here and don’t know the work well enough to really
say) in that moment when a reified idea of London-ness is dropped into the
muddy stream.

Then:

Hey, I’ve got lot’s of ideas!  And mine are a real pittance compared to
Nate Mackey’s or Kamau Brathwaite’s (read their new book!) or a whole
bunch of others.  The point being: Rorty inspires self-defeating gestures.
I like Rorty well enough but there’s something terribly wrong with his
pragmatism, as compared to Dewey’s or Ralph Ellison’s or, I dare say,
Susan Howe’s.  He makes democracy sound incredibly boring!  Rorty’s
liberal ironist is largely a private, rather than public or social,
experimenter. He doesn’t really allow, except in a tacit, ineffectual way,
for those moments in which, as Ellison puts it, it is necessary "to make
chaos out of no longer tenable forms of order."  His "solidarity" is
entirely to solid.

Brian asks,

No, I don’t think so - just that we not shy away from Adorno’s "openess
of artworks--their critical relation to the previously established, on
which their quality depends" or the implied "possibility of complete
failure."

A pleasure,   -Mike.

Stephen Jay Gould addressed this whole question, by the way, about 2 years
ago, in his book, Questioning the millennium : a rationalist's guide to a
precisely arbitrary countdown.

He concluded, in agreement with Lawrence and Dan, that the real turn of
the millenium will be January 1, 2001.

However, he took the position (with which i agree) that since popular
culture and the vast majority of individuals were definitely commited to
Jan. 1, 2000 as the turning, it would be pedantic and silly not to
acknowledge that it is also "real"  After all, the *whole* thing is
socially constructed, and it starts getting very strange if you imagine
that these things somehow exist out there as "real" phenomena in the
physical universe!

(Don't start me talking:  one of my major beliefs is that units of time
have been fetishized in a very destructive and stupid way:  "the sixties",
"the 20th century", that seventies show, the tranquilized 'fifties, the Me
Decade.....which then extended out into the preposterous and confused
fetishization of "generational" politics: Boomers, generations X, this gen
and that gen.... Jeeez...Many of these things function as masks to hide
much more (in my opinion) *real* human and histoical realities...Such as
class, social dynamics, political commitment..)

As i say,  *don't* get me started!

Oh and by the way:  the Sunday New York Times (which a socialist friend of
mine used to call, "two pounds of lies" as he picked it up with his coffee
and bagel on a sunday morning)  had an article about Cuba on Jan. 2nd,
about how the Cuban government will be celebrating the turn of the
millenium on Jan.1 2001.... The article was really the usual NYT excuse to
fling a lot of putrid right-wing snide mud at Cuba... (also typical of the
NYT, it is a rather stupid article that doesn't mention that this whole
issue has been noticed by lots of people besides the Cubans...)

post scriptum:  recently Erika and i thought to weigh the Sunday NYT, in
honor of our friend john V., and it turns out to be closer to 4 and a half
pounds of lies!!

i really haveta protest just a bit here...

since members of the APG are *extremely* different and individual in their
work and perspectives, this should be taken as just the point of view of
myself, and no one else....

but when Brian writes:

"As for the local, I feel like the term is too loaded right now to know
what it means -- I could venture based on how/what Silliman writes, but is
what O'Hara was doing writing the "local"?  Isn't A.R. Ammons writing the
"local"?  Isn't the local in terms of New York something of a tradition
now that becomes commodified (or taken as a sign of "purity"), and
couldn't one say the "local" in Atlanta becomes manifest in the very fact
of it's becoming a sort of ghost double of some of the gestures of
language poetry"


---that's when Mark reaches for (if not his revolver) at least some modest
attempts to make genuine and care-taking distinctions:

Some members of the APG (remember this is entirely MY reading):

--Randy Prunty is exploring "other sense" poetic modes, as he recently
demonstrated at the New Orleans Review conference:  poetry based in large
part on senses other than sight and sound.  Nothing very LanpPo there.
And he has done some amazing work with pieces to be performed by groups of
readers.  Not really LangPo at all.

--Much of John Lowther's work involves a systematic exploration of modes
of cognition in relation to poetry, (see his long poem on "art object and
art process" in the atlanta mag "108"); and has also been doing stuff with
long narrative forms...Even the "Readings" series (2 sections have
appeared as chapbooks) uses a panoply of sound-based and linguistic
maniuplations for reasons that have *nothing* to do with the politics of
performance and innovation contained in Watten or Andrews... Sure, because
we know each other, i know from conversation the importance for his way of
thinking of artists like David Antin and Marcel Duchamp, who have
influneced his thinking and practice in very NonLangPo directions....But
any careful reader will work out some of the same perceptions just from
paying attention to his work...

--Dana Lustig is closer to the narrative lyric modes of the "NY School"
than to any current that is associated with LangPo.

--John L. has just posted to this list describing and quoting some recent
chapbooks by James Sanders....Boy, is James ever not a LangPo't.  His
exploration of narrative/cinematic modes, his creation of poem-objects and
poem-posters, his use of vizpo graphic elements at an extremely high level
of complexity.... Well, he just ain't, not even close..

--Many other individuals linked to the group, Karen Phillips, Rebecca
Hyman, Colleen Dunne, Brian McGrath, Marla Jernigan, myself, all do work
that is obviously contemporary, but no more "langpo" than tons of other
contemporary poets known to this list, Susan Schultz, say, Jena Osman,
Karen Mac Cormack, Aldon Nielsen........


I invite you to suggest to some of those folks that they are merely "ghost
doubles of language poetry"

Oh, on refection,  i should say this:   i just posted to the list
objecting to the phrase "Ghost double of language poetry"  (used in
reference to the atlanta poets group)

..i realize that the intent of this phrase was probably not to equate us
with "langpo" but to refer to the (undeniable) fact that recently a couple
of other people have used us as a kind of stand-in for Langpo, in
discussions on the list...Ghost double in that sense

So my point was not to impugn the person who typed that phrase (Brian
Stefans?  i no longer have the original post on my computer)..But to
describe how the folks in the group each do their own thing....Because as
long as phrases like this keep popping up offhandedly, they will reinforce
this fallacious "equation" in people's minds...

Dear Poetics List,


Mudslinging seems to be the order of the day.

Dear Atlanta Poets, thank you for inviting me to a
meeting. It was a lot of fun as I said in my post
here.

But I would to tell those of you on this list who have
dropped me notes; I am not a part of the Atlanta Poets
Group. I just live here too, o.k.?

I wouldn't have thought that it was impeachable to
have written something about meeting them and having a
blast being introduced to _Finnegans Wake_ but,
apparently, it is.  I'm not sure that I'm happy about
not having poetry friends to hang out with frequently,
that's just the way it given my life these days.
Still for those of you so intent upon pigeonholing the
APG I would like to ask that you take a moment and
look in the mirror, I think that you'll find that you,
like me, and like these folks in town aren't God's
gift to the future of poetry.

Sincerely vexed,


Marla

final draft on the resolution of art object and art process  {music}
                                for davidantin

note the slow revolution of the cylinders  =20
the variance between them as i ride the pedals
note   the pedal apparatus itself    three wide footpedals=20
as one wd find on a manual sewing machine   but three instead of one=20
each larger than a sewing machine's   broader than yr foot is long=20
you must build up momentum on one first    say here    on the left
then switch to the center pedal while the right keeps on
and you have to pay attention   b/c
if any one stops    after a minute   all motion will cease
pedals   cylinders   rows   all of it
and every element is crucial to operation
now it's easy to imagine the operator's seat not as it is here
basically a tractor seat   you cd imagine it as somehow more =
comfortable
with contours and such and some will construct it this way=20
and one can imagine it taking on baroque levels of ornament
but consider this   the necessary skeleton upon which such impulses wd =
build
at this stage the maker is the only operator
but that will change presently
consider these three cylinders   their vertical axes
unhooked from the gears and without any of their rods one is struck by =
their
seeming uniformity in size    by the pattern of holes that dot their =
surface
there is always a question about this pattern and how determinate it is
this is a complex question
what happened was this ; consecutive telephone poles on north highland =
ave.
were  mapped    roughly   onto one sheet of paper whose length was =
slightly
longer than the outside area of each of the three cylinders laid end to =
end
and flat
this mapping was a charcoal rubbing of the telephone poles=20
one at a time    until all of the available map space   the paper   had =
been
used
the map was then cut into three equal parts and glued=20
one part to the template for each cylinder
where the map showed both corners of a staple from one of these poles =
it got
marked and numbered
from these numbered marks   36 were selected for each cylinder   with =
the
selection principle being   primarily   that the holes drilled wd be =
more
spread out   than   bunched together
this intention was continually challenged by the specifics of the map
now to know all of that isn't essential   I tell you to head off the
inevitable question
the cylinders' revolutions are varied b/c each is driven by its own
footpedal
when it's in action it's difficult to determine which drives which b/c =
the
cylinders don't start until all pedals are in motion and there's the
difficulty caused by the counting gears which have the following
complications to be considered
one count of a footpedal   is equal to 3 motions   forward-back-forward =
or
back-forward-back   and obviously these two succeed one another
each pedal shifts between 3 gear ratios 3:1 3:2 and 3:3=20
these are counting gears in that the operator does not shift them
each gear shifts only when a count of 108 has been reached on its drive
pedal
nor do the gears shift in easily predictable sequence
it wd take a chart to illustrate the shift pattern
suffice to say   that if cylinder X reaches a shift point the =
determining
variables are which gears the other two cylinders are in    and    =
their
relations sequentially to the cylinder that has reached shift point
this somewhat arbitrarily   but equitably   determines that cylinder =
X's
gear shift up
from 1st to 2nd for instance or down from 1st to 3rd
the gear mechanism is quite complex but the operator   having made it   =
will
understand it enough
will even pointlessly know which pedal drives which cylinder
if we're clear about the footpedals  counting gears and cylinders we =
need to
turn our attention to the rods  the classes of tips  the rows  and the
selection of their keys
the rods are relatively straightforward    each is just under 3" in =
length
and something less than an inch around
on one end a screw extends another =BE's of an inch=20
on the other a flattened head something like a nail but with a threaded =
hole
in its middle
the screw end gets inserted into one of the holes on the surface of a
cylinder and twisted tight until it's tight
note   once a rod has been screwed in it will protrude about 2.5" from =
the
surface of the cylinder
if one depresses the rod it'll catch   and then only protrude about =
=BE's of
an inch
press again and the rod'll release and regain its full height
ok   with all the holes   on all the cylinders filled by rods we're =
ready to
begin putting the tips on them
now i neglected to point out that each of the holes   on each of the
cylinders was   after the template was removed   numbered from 1 to 108
these numbers were not applied in any specific order save that no two
consecutive numbers are found on the same cylinder
here's a chart of the tip placement=20
as you can see it's divided into 4 groups of 27 and above each group is =
a
heading
these headings are  'ball and spring'  'brush'  'mallet'  and 'stick'
these designations are only approximate and each tip is a unique item =
not
replicated by any other tip in use
ball and spring tips are what they sound like   they might be a spring =
or a
wire with one screw end for the rod   as all the tips have   and the =
other
end driven into or somehow attached to an object such as a small rubber =
ball
ball of wood   or ceramic
in each case the materials vary   in size   weight   strength of spring
brush tips might be strands of wire or heads of paintbrushes   plastic
bristles   or even just one strand of stiff rope or cord
mallet tips are formed something like a drummer's mallet   but the =
heads of
them might be of felt  wood   metal   plastic  or even stone=20
and stick tips might range from modified drumsticks to just about any
straight and reasonably hard object of the appropriate length
this one is made of a section of rubber tubing
with all the tips screwed in   the cylinders have a pincushion look to =
them
or   perhaps more apt   wd be a comparison to the little barrel inside =
a
music box
amassing a collection of a usable tips and their maintenance is a
time-consuming and careful job=20
they can become damaged and break now and then and they should on =
occasion
be replaced simply so that no tip is always in operation
for these reasons it's useful to have a number of spares on hand
when any tip is joined to a rod   combined they protrude a fixed 5.5" =
from
the surface of the cylinder
this fact is very important   as on the opposite side of the cylinders =
from
the operator's seat these tips must be of just the right length to =
strike
the keys=20
before we consider the variety of keys let's take a look at the rows =
which
hold them and the assembly that generates their movement
the rows themselves are simply strips of metal with small vise grips =
evenly
spaced along them for holding the keys in place
both sides are scored such that these large screws at top and bottom as =
they
turn cause the row itself to move up or down
you can see now why the cylinders are placed this high above the ground
why the operator's seat is so high also  =20
it's so that the rows can pass completely below the bottom edge of the
cylinders before they begin to be raised again
their motion is   as with everything else here  determined by the =
footpedal
that drives the cylinder to which they are linked  =20
initially each row is loaded from the top and they can be loaded with =
either
side down but once operation has begun they move down or up in response =
to
the footpedal
the chart i referenced in regard to the counting gears is again used =
here
but with each of the designations changed
when a shift point is reached by a pedal  a new gear assignment is =
generated

there's also the potential that the row will begin to move in the =
opposite
direction from what it was doing until that moment
as happens now and then a row makes it all the way to the top or bottom =
it
automatically switches direction and proceeds down or up respectively
finally the keys must be considered
unlike the tips their placement is not mandated and their composition =
is in
no way grouped beforehand
the parameters that must be attended to are two ;
that when struck by a key they make a sound ;
that they be of the right size to span the distance between the row and =
tips
when extended
their materials are even more wide ranging and various than those used =
for
the tips
but keep in mind   the keys take a beating   and they must be changed
frequently as they break   bend   and are on occasion knocked out of =
the
grips that hold them
it is essential to have as many spare keys available as one can =
reasonably
accumulate in the event of such accidents
the finding and modification of materials to use as keys is a near =
constant
activity for any operator
and after a time almost any piece of scrap metal or plastic appears a
potential key before it's seen as anything else
maintenance of the gears and their connections to the cylinders and =
rows is
also a task that requires patience and care on the part of an operator
the reward is a music impervious to mastery  utterly singular and
indifferent to predation
a music dependant on an object and yet a music process unavoidably=20
both aspects in this case resolved in what you've just built=20

For my purposes (as editor) I go by what Nataniel Tarn has to say about
it in his essay in Jacket:
(http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket09/tarn-on-paz.html).  Disjoined
syntax as a central trope, or that becomes a mannerism, or
"disjunctivitis."  A bit limited, but it works for me.

I've just read the posts by Joe Amato and Brian Stefans. (It took
me four and a half hours to do so-- I'm somewhat a slow reader).
Seriously, though, they are both extremely interesting-- I suppose
examples of this List at its thoughtful best and most useful.

I just have a couple of points while still mulling over some of the
things said:

First, to correct Joe, my "Buffalo '99" piece appears in the
_current_ issue (# 3) of Skanky Possum, which can be ordered
from skankypossum@hotmail.com

Second, in answer to Brian's question re: the making of the
interview-- it was done entirely on e-mail in the space of a week or
so. I should say that one of the things amazing to me was the
velocity with which my questions were responded to by HG, so it
had the feel (though I suppose such indicates how the medium is
messing with our brains) of a "spontaneous" conversation.

Third: Brian is right that I tried to "edge" Henry into a provocative
response when I asked about his exclusion for the Poetics List.
His answer took me by surprise, to tell the truth. It's a gentle
answer that says something about Gould.

Fourth: And partly in the light of what I just said, Brian's tour de
force of questions (and Joe's post more indirectly) has hovering
over it an overarching and ghostly big Question, which could be
phrased in many ways but which might go like this:
"Isn't it a shame that a person whose life is informed by such
eloquent love for poetry and whose thought provokes such
reflection and response from others is not able to be here to
answer their good questions and thus extend that spirit of
discussion and debate on which real community in writing
depends?"

I can't speak for him and don't know if Gould would feel able to
come back, even though this "place" meant a great deal to him
personally. But isn't it high time to say clearly (without it meaning
that anyone "lost" or whatever) that the "mistake" that was made
constituted a serious, regretable wrong? I know I might sound
millennial in saying so, but I'm absolutely certain that the righting
or not righting of the wrong will be noticed by many poets down the
road looking back.

A comment on baby...

It is interesting to note that the word bebe in French was derived,
according to the Robert, from the English in 1841.  Unfortunately, it does
not give the quotation of first use.  French dictionaries prior to that
date do not include the word in the lexicon.  The English use of the word
gained at that point international currency.  Could it have had something
to do with the industrial revolution and the surge of prostitution? (London
was the world capital with estimates up to 120,000) Was it at that time we
started to use the word "babe" to describe a beautiful woman?  Most women
would hardly have had the time to keep their skin soft and hair washed,
what with taking care of all the babies...

Baudelaire, in L'Invitation au Voyage, seems to forshadow the current use
of baby (babe), "bebe" in the way he uses "enfant":

Mon enfant, ma soeur,
Songe a la douceur
D'aller la bas vivre ensemble!
Aimer a loisir,
Aimer et mourir
Au pays qui te ressemble...

The poem was published in 1862.

Speaking about giggling, what about Japan, where women's social
speech-tones are artificially high, a sort of permanent giggle?

Contrast to many European countries where women are encouraged to have low
speech tones.

hm, doesn't seem to ring as true in my experience. which may be little,
comparitively. how about so-called differences between the sexes is used
more as excuse to secure such practices? but let me ask: are there not
various aspects of the average american male's - and female's - sexual
tastes/practices/desires that seem to indicate obvious pedophiliac
tendencies? but i've certainly not researched/studied this in even a
remotely scientific manner. lol. harmless questions, really, blink.

and this: >> I don't think men dressing up as babies and getting spanked is
related to pedophilia, either...<<
elicits not only a playful smirk, but a related bounce: that perhaps
pedophilia, shaving & even child-like sexual role-play, etc. are indeed
related - may be simple sexual nostalgia?

no judgment re such things on my part, i'd like to point out. this is
nothing by way of complaint or nonesuchdarklycrummyeww things. only
curiosity & conversation.

Subject:      Just Gould
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The occasion for the Henry Gould interview, it seems to me, was his
excommunication from this otherwise well preserved list. And it makes sense
for him to reflect publicly about that. So Kent's provocative questions I
think give Gould space to speak his mind.



Brian Kim Stefans brings up some good questions about rationality, its shape
and form both historically and socially. And I think that he's right to
point out that Gould could be confusing things. For instance, in the
interview, Gould writes:



"The idea is that poetry is a progressive force for a demythologized,
egalitarian materialism - by analyzing and rejecting all forms of
idealizing/poeticizing rhetoric. . . Maybe if you take these premises to the
limit, as Bernstein tries to do, it can be understood as 'revolutionary': in
a rationalist post-Enlightenment sense, uprooting all remnants of antique,
medieval and romantic spiritual 'aura' around language on behalf of the
demystified human will."



There's nothing rational about "uprooting all remnants of antique, medieval
and romantic spiritual 'aura' around language...." In fact, Bernstein, and
some others within the Language tradition, are irrational, or arational
perhaps, for their insistence on foregrounding social and material
assumptions about late 20th century cultural phenomena, at the expense of
historical and psychological antecedents. This tradition of writing also
seeks to subvert and reveal structures of power (of the community,
corporation, individual), without seeking or presenting a comparable sense
of justice. The dispossessed, who could stand a little Lone Ranger styled
justice, are not awed by poetic revelations of power's truculent existence.
Subverting the powers that be, however marginally or inclusively one moves
within its walls, is a nice gesture. But without an accompanying demand for
justice, power subversions merely strip the Emperor of his clothes. He's
still the man in charge. (Cf. Presidente Clinton). A sense of justice
requires a rational faculty and an imagination sympathetic enough to inhabit
opposing spaces.



Not to belabor the point, but Kent's interview with Gould seems to be an
attemt to restore justice, and to reopen an issue unreasonably closed to
debate by those for whom power issues have been important, at least
theoretically. If nothing else, Gould's dismissal from The List revealed how
power is used at the animal level by those for whom we might desire a
greater sense of justice.



Anyway, Brian brings up some other good points, but Henry should answer
those himself. Who knows. Maybe his cyber ghost is listening in.

Bob,

This description does not fit much if not all of the writing of Bob
Perelman, Rae Armantrout, Barrett Watten, Carla Harryman, Lyn Hejinian,
David Bromige, Tina Darragh, Erica Hunt, Charles Bernstein, myself..... It's
like saying that any poem that mentions a painting is a NY School work.

For my purposes (as editor) I go by what Nataniel Tarn has to say about
it in his essay in Jacket:
(http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket09/tarn-on-paz.html).  Disjoined
syntax as a central trope, or that becomes a mannerism, or
"disjunctivitis."  A bit limited, but it works for me.

Subject:      Hunting facts for inspiration
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 5, 2000

Sonia Sanchez hunted facts for inspiration for the inaugural poem.
It took work to wax poetic for Street

By James M. O'Neill

INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

For her latest artwork, acclaimed poet Sonia Sanchez had to do some
sleuthing.
Asked only a week before to craft a poem for Mayor Street's inaugural on
Monday, Sanchez jumped into the task, scanning the two-page bio Street's
team gave her.

But that terse curriculum vitae didn't set Sanchez's creative juices afire.

"A two-page CV," Sanchez said yesterday with a smile, "does not help inspire
poems."

Sanchez had a passing acquaintance with Street. She had shaken his hand at
the occasional ceremony or fund-raiser. And she remembered his days manning
a hot-dog stand at Temple University in the late 1970s, when she was just
starting her decades-long tenure as an English professor there.

But she wanted something more. Searching for the personal, she cornered
Street's friends.

"Too often we don't see the human component of public figures," Sanchez
said. "It's always the gloss."

From lawyer Ron White she learned of Street's aversion to sweets, and the
huge bowl of fruit that sits in his office. "I'm a vegetarian," Sanchez
said, "so I think that's exquisite."

Naturally, that detail found its way into the poem.

From Carl Singley, a trusted adviser to Street, she learned of the new
mayor's political and personal history, his "directness, his knowing what he
wants."

She learned of his youth on a Norristown farm. That sparked Sanchez's search
for a strong image to represent the new mayor in her poem, this man from
nowhere who had risen to power.
And so she made it a point to emphasize in the poem that:
"In this city / where history stretches in aristocratic silence / In this
city / where hope blooms like flowers / . . . a worker's son / has become
the mayor of Philadelphia. / The city is not the same / because a worker's
son / has come with eyes like diamonds, / . . .has come at the beginning /
of the 21st century / carrying the quiet urgency / of a star."

And she wanted an image of nature to symbolize the route his life had taken.

"From a Norristown farm of privation / he crossed cities with hands quiet, /
stood tall as lightning, / heard the propagators of poverty call his name, /
But his legs, tongue caught fire / . . . swam downstream, away from
graveyards . . . / became a mountain. Not a hill or terrace. / Finally a
mountain raining veins of silver / and gold."

"It was like he had been in the valleys and struggled to come out," Sanchez
said. "His story tells us it is possible to do this. He was moving mountains
to become mayor."

Because of the tight time limit, Sanchez wrote her poem at all hours - early
in the morning in her sunlit Germantown study, late at night in her bedroom.
Even when she wasn't actually writing, she was crafting the poem.

"Once you begin working on a poem, the movement continues," Sanchez said.
"When you're cooking, walking, driving, your mind goes back to the poem."

She wanted to touch on democracy in the poem somehow. She penned a line, but
even as she set it down, she cringed. "I had done this little corny thing -
I knew as I was writing it, and I thought, 'Oh, no!' "

Perhaps a quote from someone else would be more appropriate.

But who? Sanchez liked Langston Hughes. She was fond of Philadelphian W.E.B.
Du Bois. She pulled a book of Du Bois' writings off a shelf in her study,
intending just to flip through, with no particular quote in mind. The book
opened randomly, she started reading - and there was the quote that would
help her sew the poem together.

"Sometimes when you're writing, something magical happens," Sanchez said. "I
opened the book and saw the quote and thought, 'Oops, that's it!' When we
write, we are not really alone. We are connected to other people. We always
have voices speaking to us.

"That great genius W.E.B. Du Bois said: What shall the end be? / The world -
old and fearful things. / War and wealth / murder and luxury?/ Or shall it
be / a new thing - a new place and / a new democracy of all races: / A great
humanity of equal men and women!"

Sanchez said that at Temple, she always tried to get students from every
race and background to work together.

"We've got to teach this generation that if the world is to stay alive, they
must learn to live together," she said.

She saw her Street poem as a way to get that message across to a wider
audience. Not just to the new mayor, but to all Philadelphians.
After building up Street as a mountain among men, Sanchez ended her poem
with a challenge of sorts, crystallizing the hopes and expectations Street -
any new mayor, for that matter - engenders from the electorate.

The new slate. The clean start. The pure beginning, like that of an innocent
child:

"Let us accompany this man called John / Street towards a new thing: / the
truth in our children's eyes; / let us wash the feet of this city / let us
sanitize the walls of this city / with peace, racial, social and sexual
justice, / let us inaugurate flint and feather / Steel and silk / country
and cathedral / in this city of heritage."

She knew it was finished after she had read it aloud - she always reads her
work aloud.

"When I read this poem, it felt good. I felt I had gotten across what I
wanted to say - not only to Mayor Street, but also to the city of
Philadelphia."

One pedophilia PS: I wrote earlier that a pedophile wouldn't be attracted to
a shaved, naive woman, because pedophiles want the "genuine article."  What
I meant by this was less a genuine young person than a person genuinely
devoid of artifice (which includes, of course, shaving one's legs) (although
youth clearly IS a priority).  This is why Humbert Humbert is not a
pedophile: Lolita knows she's sexy, & works it.  Plus: girls have hairy
legs, don't they?  Or are they more blindly-kindly called "downy" at that
age?

Re: baby---just thinking of a few interesting places this term has cropped
up and, it seems to me, stuck out a bit: the 90's film "Swingers,"
throughout which women are referred to as "babies," "beautiful babies,"
etc., to the exclusion of any other term, and these are women the men in the
film haven't *met* yet, lessening the possibility of the term's being used
as a personal endearment.  Fred MacMurray tensely, continually, and, I find,
hilariously, referring to Barbara Stanwyck as "Baby" in "Double
Indemnity"--while his character's a total babe in the woods and she couldn't
be further from naive.  Amy Grant singing, in the 80's? early 90's? "Baby
Baby," a song *she wrote for her infant*; in the video, Grant is singing to
a man; when performing the song at, I think it was, the Grammys, she sang to
her (brought onstage) child.

Maybe less relevantly to this inquiry, there's "Wayne's World"'s Garth: "If
she were a president, she'd be Babe-raham Lincoln."  (& what about Babe
Ruth?--yet "Babe," to me, is almost entirely stripped of any but
sexual/romantic connotations: the only baby I've ever heard referred to as a
"babe" was Jesus).  And Toni Morrison's "Baby Suggs," who acquires "Baby" as
a first name because, as a born slave, she's never "properly" named and her
husband calls her Baby.   And, of course, "Bringing Up Baby"--where the
leopard is named "Baby", it seems, solely as a plot device that allows
Hepburn's and Grant's characters to seem to be singing "I Can't Bring You
Anything But Love (Baby)" to, variously, each other and strangers.

"Fat Men in Space" [right?] isn't in Pinkwater's *5 Novels*, but it does
inc. "Slaves of Spiegel" and the happily titled "Young Adult Novel"...

downily yrs,

Subject:      knowing what a joke means
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

George Bowering posts:

>This person is telling an uptight mistaken polcor joke, right?

I dunno, George, that's all geek to me.

Further, Leonard & Billy & whomever can proceed on their interpretation of
this joke as being abt the stereotype of the Irishman as stupid, but it was
never that to me. (I wasnt aware there is such a stereotype until they told
me, even tho the woman who raised me was Irish). I heard it as a joke abt
the craftiness and perspicacity of the Irish (another stereotype, but one
far less objectionable, I should have thought), whereby an "each way" bet
has been placed & either situation has been covered.

I guess I'm too gullible to be told jokes. Like I said, I am sorry that
leaping to a single assumption has brought some Listmates grief. It appears
no alternative was possible. I suppose, as "Dutch" Leonard says, it is I
who am  stoopid, thinking the Irishman was clever. I have always admired
the Dutch for their frankness, broadmindedness, ability to laugh at
themselves, and their civility, qualities not always easy to hold in
balance. I dont think the Moderator, though, ought to be blamed for not
spotting the only possible meaning of this joke.  Possibly he, too, was
unaware of this particular stereotype. Obviously, someone living in Ireland
has the advantage of us auslanders when it comes to their national
stereotypes.

In future, I shall make sure that my jokes all begin "An Esperantese, a
Venutian and a Martian were discoursing in a bar...." --But then won't I be
told that the latter two types are gender-coded?

If Leonard and Billy are correct, obviously the joke would be clearer if it
began, "When a stupid person goes to bed, he places on his bedside
table.....".How come, then, it is actually funnier if it begins, "When a
crafty and perspicacious person goes to bed, he places on his bedside
table....".  Because, you say, the element of surprise obtains in the
latter instance only? But the same could be said of the joke if it began
"When a mentally incompetent person goes to bed, he places on his bedside
table....", for one would hardly expect someone designated as mentally
incompetent to be capable of such foresight and care in execution. Yet when
the joke begins in such a fashion, I do not find it funny.

It was only fear of being thought vain of the country of my birth that
stopped me from altering the joke before I posted it, so that it might
begin, "When an Englishman (or "Limey," or "Pom") goes to bed, he places on
his bedside table.....". Perhaps it is merely personal, but I have always
thought of the English as thorough, if a tad too deliberate. Since in the
Land of Stereotypes, we do not expect the English (unlike the Irish) to be
scintillant, inspired, off-the-cuff, the thoroughness and the
deliberateness will be what we see, rather than the perspicacity and
craftiness. (And stupidity, once one is aware of _that_ stereotype.)

Well, as they say about the sixties, if you remember Moosehead you
weren't there.  Was it the peyote or Bowering, fetching in antlers?  I

Prologos, by Jonathan Bayliss. A novel,

or more accurately, a large book of speculative writing, full of beautifully
complex sentences that run rings around "the life of" the central character.
  To take a few sentences off the back of the book, "[t]he intricate form of
Prologos reveals Emerson's whole Man Thinking (though not according to
Emerson's thought), and thinking as much about woman and children as about
less personal interests.  At the back of the book a schematic diagram of the
Table of Contents maps the normal course of reading ... less patient
"Postulants" (who will naturally be tentative in devoting time to unfamiliar
content) will be guided through [a] "Second Curriculum" as if through a
computer program, in such manner that after grasping the basic story they
can decide whether or not to pursue apparent digressions or abstractions.
If they continue on this path, they will read the whole book in
non-sequential order.  A "Third Curriculum" ... is intended for readers who
wish to make a selective review (or preview) of the "Pythagorean triple"
that represents [main character] Michael Chapman's oddly bourgeois life."
About 1100 pages, and

the introductory volume to a trilogy based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, the
first two volumes of wch have been published under the respective titles,
Gloucesterbook and Gloucesteride, the third, Gloucestermas, being in
progress.  The books chart

the life of the central character's relationship with his locale, town, and
its various denizens in terms of political, social and economic theory,
especially as these relate through mythological and religious "histories" to
the living life of the ensemble momently at hand.  They also give what I'm
told by one who shld know, a very accurate portrait of the late Charles
Olson, here operating under the pseudonym Ipsissimus Charlemagne.  But

Prologos, set in Berkeley, lays the groundwork for all that follows - this,
after all, is a LIFE'S work - and is probably the best place to begin.

Prologos can probably be got through the publisher, Basilicum Press, at 121
Lake Shore Drive, Ashburnham, MA 01430

Subject:      Atlanta Poets Revisited
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Dear Mark and others,
I apologize if my comment made it sound like I was essentializing the poets
in Atlanta with a suggestion that they are, by nature, a "ghost double of
language poetry."  This was a rhetorical mistake -- I was sort of writing
this statement to Jacques, and accepting for the moment that his comment had
value you to it (rather than arguing that value, just accepting it to make
my point).  I'm not sure that Jacques was essentializing in this way either,
but I won't take that up.  My sentence, in this public context, should have
been more like "that we [who is this "we"?] see the Atlanta poets involved
in the APG as a sort of ghost double to language poetry," or something along
those lines, in other word admitting this outside view (I'm not in Atlanta),
the fact that it has holes, exceptions, or could be just a big mistake, etc.
(I'm very close to many of the poets once involved in the Kootenay School in
Canada, who have often been, in reductive statements, called a sort of
tail-end to Language poetry, despite their very different practices;
consequently, as an "Asian American," I have tried to avoid anything
suggesting essential qualities in writing about writers purportedly of that
group -- I hate to use scare quotes [Adorno said it was cheap], I am Korean
American if anyone is, but I don't see how that could determine anyone's
writing, nor do I see how being in Atlanta could.)  Anyway, I thought the
"sort of" and the "some" in the line would have suggested the provisionality
of the statement -- I don't think there's anything essential about, well,
poetry, and my statements on Miles Champion would suggest this (i.e. that
the same poem could have differences of meaning in relation to the time and
place in which it was composed, as well as its relations to predecessor
poems -- contingency).
Thanks for your ideas, though; this kind of descriptive writing seems to me
useful.
Brian

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,

Having first got it on at age 14 myself I'd like to
say that I knew quite clearly what I was doing. Yet I
am bothered by seeing young women agressively
sexualized in magazines and television shows. Why does
it feel better that I was so tomboy that I was
mistaken for a boy until age 17 or so.

I agree with Emily Lloyd's post on whole, but I think
that the designation "pedophile" while representing
something rather loathsome, is an attitude that finds
its object in powerless sexual partners (objects);
college profs sleeping with freshman, 40 year old
business men dallying with 21 years olds...

There is nothing to say that a 14 year old and a 50
year old couldn't make sweet love but the power thing
is disturbing when it becomes a part of the equation.

Sincerely,

Marla


> > The 14-yr-old had instigated the relationship, was
perfectly happy with it, etc.,but when it was found
out, the cops were called and spent much of the show
giving her the ol' "You realize what that lady did to
you was BAD" and "That woman is a very confused lady"
& "You were taken advantage of, you know" schtick,
because they refused to acknowledge even the
possibility that a 14-yr-old could choose to enter a
lesbian relationship.  At any rate, the girl's only
care was that her lover not be harmed or arrested,
which the cops of course promised, just about the time
their cop buddies were harming and arresting the lover

When I die I need you to create my philosophy.
Please do go and read all of the Internet Text before it is taken away.
It can be taken away at any moment and you must save it yourself.
Then when I die you can go back and love every word for its brilliance.
You can harbor words close to your body so you will finally understand me.
All my words connect through underground chambers very close to the truth.
The chambers form hieroglyphs of the mind and my philosophy.
You will find everything you need in these hieroglyphs of my philosophy.
You must take a great deal of time because thought does not come quickly.
Every moment you spend on my Internet Text will be repaid in full.
You will be utterly changed because you will have worked it out yourself.
All truths cannot be uttered by anyone except yourself.
I have opened the gate for you to understand this and other truths.
In my Internet Text you will discover if there are truths at all.
Perhaps you will discover if there are truths in any case.
My own needs will be met if you read and reread my text and understand.
To understand you must save the words and the order of the words.
My own needs are those of surviving through the words I have written.
No one will understand me fully for decades except through concentration.
Concentration and study are the keynotes to this success.
With all my heart I promise you this will all be worthwhile.
You will judge for yourself and realize the truth I have given you.
The philosophy is there within as the greatest gift of all.
Please be successful with my philosophy and save my very words.
This is a hope for tomorrow and I will never know if I am in your heart.
Thank you for preserving my Internet Text and studying its philosophy.

1. In The Attic of the House of the Dead, by Hugh Steinberg   (poetry)  $6
(will retail for $11)
Chapbook with letterpress cover, with poems from the author's *A Book of
Days,* the "March" sequence. This book is currently being produced and will
be ready by January 10, 2000.

        March 28
        the rope of yourself. hair colored. birdnests. your hat. a coat.
        the story of your body as the unraveling of rope. like someone
        who is always leaving. let me kiss your chin. this morning I took
        a walk and I saw a Checker cab. Brittany, this man said, addressing
        his 9-year-old daughter. you will probably never ride in one of these
        again. 5,000 Checkers once roamed this city. now there are two.
        to travel through a city. to hold a kite in your arm. to be like a little
        bird in a shopping mall. to listen to a fountain. to not buy anything.
        because I have enough rope. I’ve been working on this knot for years.
        put your finger here. it will always be that way.



2. The Said Lands, Islands, and Premises, by  Mary Margaret Sloan
(poetry)        $7   (retails for $11)
"Sloan's passion for words -- their lipstick traces and lingering
inflections (as grammar would have it) -- makes for a poetry of
extraordinary pleasure and difficulty. The mind and ear are redirected from
inherited sequence to intentional mutation. As consummate artificer,
Sloan's skill and gift demand an equally rigorous reading. Her first book
assumes the presence of a mature collection and takes American poetry into
its next argument."
--Kathleen Fraser



3. Speech Acts, by Eli Goldblatt        (poetry)        $6   (retails for $10)
"Energetic and engaging work, ranging over *ache* and *embrace,* reality
and dream in a rich, quicksilver language."
--Rachel Blau DuPlessis
"Eli Goldblatt writes realist lyrics; this is not a world that is 'utterly
c hanged,' it's more the place where the question, 'What language does the
poet speak?' is beginning and goal of writing. These poems speak our
languages, with care and pasion.
--Bob Perelman


4. The Closets of Heaven, by Diane Glancy   (fiction)   $7   (retails for $12)
In this novel, Dorcas (Tabitha) is a seamstress who holds the world
together with her stitches.



5. (Ado)ration, by Diane Glancy   (poetry)      $7   (retails for $12)
42 poems by Glancy -- poems of energy and high wit, compassion and deep
thinking.

        Assimilation

           Tell me, if the Virgin Mary has walked throughout all the land,
                why has she never entered the wigwam of the Apache?
                                -- Cochise

        The land divided now by roads \
        the rusted leaves  \  fly.
        Lightning frantic as limbs.  Some upstairs woods
        \  we aim for.  Field trampled
        by hooves of cattle  \  glint of barn  \
        the gusty star flung as a javelin.



6. < a ' s a t t v >, by Peter Ganick   (poetry)        $7   (retails for $12)
"We read < a ' s a t t v > for its physics of the aleatory, its
perpendicular musicology and cabaret of strifes. Theatricalities, though,
comprise only a fraction of the red-shifted meditative forces Peter Ganick
puts into play. Ideolect and bricolage pull together, emanating new
corpuses of behavior with language, 'emitting sociability,' as Ganick has
it, a 'bill world' almost cheerfully acclimating a 'bob world' within its
densely graveled 'klatsch.' Thanks to Ganick we are worlds richer, worlds
ahead, imminent to their launch."
--Jack Kimball



7. & Calling It Home, by Lisa Cooper   (poetry) $7   (retails for $12)
"Lisa Cooper asks big questions. Like what is sense? Or why do men and
women do what they do? Is it nature or culture? And she asks them of
today's saints of everything that matters: Jack Spicer and Gertrude Stein.
She gets no answers from either. But she writes a lot of great poems in the
asking."
--Juliana Spahr



8. Chromatic Defacement, by Phillip Foss   (poetry)     $7   (retails for $12)
"Phillip Foss's *Chromatic Defacement* is a new fin de siecle theater of
cruelty with the roles played by perfumes, echoes, and elisions.
'Coquettish effluvia.' Susan Howe meets Bataille and they have this child
called 'Fetter of Nuance', or, in fact, Chromatic Defacement."
--Rae Armantrout



9. Hopeful Buildings, by Charles Alexander   (poetry)   $6   (retails for $9.95)
"Thinking is the experience of everyday living, and Charles Alexander's
work is a poetry of thinking. But it is experience, not difficulty, that
wonderfully complicates these poems and brings them very close. I hope many
people will read *Hopeful Buildings* and take great p leasure both in its
detail and in the larger construct that the details, perceived, provide. I
do."
--Lyn Hejinian

        from "Inside Moves, Punctual Matters"

        A mustard poultice makes medical history.
        For the record, erase the woeful strain.
        Candidates stump the nation,
                bumper stickers err gramatically.
        Stop. This line makes a turn.

        Make a wish that moves as music.
        Saxophone causes skin to open.
        Take you, for example,
                surround me with stretched limbs.
        Do it again. It never composes.



10. A Reading 8-10, by Beverly Dahlen   (poetry)        $7   (retails for $12)
"Here her true unlike-anythingness, hear her see through, somehow about
*you,* the 'privacy in invention' *becomes* a reading. Dahlen's is a
gorgeous argument, methodical, indexed by an intricate thinking. Historical
and future, desire and emptiness. Simple. Mythical. 'the antithesis of
primal words' is primal too. A reading how it goes out remnants, resistant,
her far and wide a future tense timed swing shift speaks up, generative --
expect something else. 'here was twisting, all kinds of thorniness.'
Careful. A normal heroine astounds."
--Jessica Grim & Melanie Neilson



11. Precisely the Point Being Made, by Norman Fischer   (poetry)        $6
(retails for $10)
"If Gertrude Stein were a Zen monk family man living on a farm by the ocean
at the tail end of the century, she would be Norman Fischer."
--Kit Robinson



12. 3 of 10, by Hank  Lazer   (poetry)  $8   (retails for $14)
"Lazer asserts that poets are 'portals multiply open.' *3 of 10* gives us
something of the story of how he arrived at that formulation. It is a
formulation deeply involved with a perception about mythology, for to think
mythologically is to think chordally, in clusters of simultaneously-sounded
'tones.' That is the kind of thinking -- and writing -- we 'hear' in this
deeply conscious, deeply self-conscious work."
--Jack Foley



13. The Tongue Moves Talk, by Karen Mac Cormack   (poetry)      $7   (retails
for $11)
"Sense is made and remade word for word in Karen Mac Cormack's *The Tongue
Moves Talk.* Exquisite refractory, incessantly modulating, sumptuously
uttering, these poems attain a state of aesthetic grace without recourse to
hooks or props."
--Charles Bernstein



14. Prospect of Release, by  Tom Mandel   (poetry)      $7   (retails for $12.95)
"Memento mori: sonnets. These 50 poems, 700 lines (neither number divisible
by three), confront self, other, identity, loss, history, language and
meaning through the most concrete instance we have of what the
poststructuralists call 'an absent presence' -- the death of a parent. This
loss of apparent meaning (who gave you your name?) doubles (this father
arrived by marriage, already a rhyme for the dead blood kin that came
before), invoking tradition, transmission, instruction . . . These are the
most intensely felt poems I have ever read."
--Ron Silliman



15. Teth, by Sheila Murphy   (poetry)   $6   (retails for $9)
"Not the wrong word but the nonword, word purely as spacer . . . will come
in here, as people like Murphy really like the phrase as a thing different
from a word and prior. What her eye falls on, kites, clothes-pins, record
jackets, gets in but not . . . as diurnal notation, this because t
his-then, but as a religious trusting of the perceptual manifold to be an
Event."
-- Gerald Burns



16. art facts: a book of contexts, by bpNichol   (poetry, prose, visual
poetry, etc.)   $11   (retails for $15)
"He [Nichol] was Toronto's most innovative poet at a time when that city
could claim more innovative poets than any other in the English speaking
world. Whatever mode he was working in, he approached it as though he had
to reinvent it from the ground up . . . probably more than any of his
contemporaries he embodied the joyful spirit of invention, that elusive
center of all the arts in this century. His printed and recorded work bear
partial witness to that spirit."
--Karl Young

the idea of 'threads' in an e-discussion
while it makes a certain sense
also gives a curiously false impression

that we might pick up and 'end' and then
trace back and find the, singular, other
'end' ---- i don't have a new metaphor to offer

Silliman posted a piece about
_@poetics_ wherein he mentions
"the local" in a three pronged post

prong one talks of the misapplied
sense of unity when looking back
at the movements of the 60s

prong two mentions the "simpler"
landscape of poetry when he
arrived on the scene

contrasting it with the landscape now
where there is simply too much
happening for any critical "mastery"

prong three asserts no "answer" and
holds nothing up as a "solution"
instead he says simply

"Both of these thoughts have been
 driving me toward the idea that the local
 is more important now than ever."

Joel Weishaus replies suggesting that locality
 is somewhat antique "a poem that rhapsodizes...
 place seems to me like an Arthurian legend"

now i read that and thought he was saying
that given the big old virtual world, that
a sense of the local was old-hat

but then he says "Now place exists only
 as a myth. And where a myth lurks,
 poetry sounds itself out."

next up Heather Allen, it seems to me,
says some good stuff but also
seems to be responding to stuff i can't find

"Does it [poetry] truly have to be about epitomizing
 a certain standard?"  who said it does? is HA
 psychically predicting posts yet to come ?

i agree with Heather that one need not focus
in either direction (local... and the what? the
self-alienated misanthopicality ? ..) both are open

and it is veritably cool deal that i now have
friends in australia and california and new england
and all over b/c of the web & email

Patrick Herron added a note of caution about
just that sense of making friends, and his point is
well taken, but i've found on numerous occasions

already that folks i've met and liked on email
have turned out to be just as likable in person
only once so far have i had that table turned

Heather Allen addressed Ron Silliman at the
end of her post saying something about how we
"must" now feel "competed against" (by the masses?)

but that confuses me as i can't find much
in Silliman's post to justify this question at all
but that, if anything, should be unsurprising

Patrick Herron also noted to everyone involved
that "the internet is making clear the importance
 of proximity" and i think this is a great point

i may not be quite as suspicious about
the possibility of communicating in this medium
as i ought to be or as Patrick may be

but i do think that Tom Beckett is correct
in everything he says in his posting --- here it is
again, in toto;

                     > The "local" and the "global"
 are __false__cognates.  As the new information
 technologies "shrink" the" world",  the world

 becomes less knowable because it comes
 to seem more abstract and similar.
    And I still insist that what e-mail listservs

 tend to produce is speech
 without social context--a whole lot
 of bad monologues. <

to me it seems to be the dislocation
of the medium  --- i find i want it to be
a forum in the old sense

where anyone can have their say
where anyone can listen, or not
where we're not at each other's throats 24/7

but, lacking the locality, the physical
presence of others, lacking any but the most
oblique and dislocated sense of address

in the short run i'm trying to avoid that here
this post is addressed to everyone whose
posts i am responding to...  But the long run ?

Joel W wasnt swayed by Tom B's post and wrote;
"What world are we talking about? Perhaps there
 are as many worlds as ... minds to perceive them."

and while true that Tom's comment isnt
something one cd prove --- the notion that each
mind makes its own world is a bit iffy as well

each mind as some irreducible untouched monad
---- i don't know hope there cd ever be for consensus
on any of these kinds of questions

nor what it wd matter if any cd be reached
but for those of you keeping track i believe there
is a world out there that we share

a reality that is --- and i take the real to be
that which is what it is regardless of
our thoughts about it (perceptions too i s'pose)

and it's circumstantial evidence sure
but we seem to agree on so much and to be able
to, when we differ, to work towards common ground

        (if that last line is read
         as irony i can only say
        i didnt mean it to be so)

in here someplace is Brian Stefan's post
to Rebecca at _Fence_ --- lots of interesting stuff
i'd like to 2nd the suspicions raised about

"the general reader" ---- that's an abstraction that
i'd just assume do without if i can (tho admitting
that it is hard) --- i like _Fence_ by the way

next up is Jacques Debrot with a post that
many lauded but that i found really quite confusing
when it wasnt being somewhat grandiose

in his 1st numbered section Jacques talks of
the complacency of mainstream poetry the relationship
of its readers to it and it's "soul-making" a/effect

that last bit Patrick H responds to neatly
covering most of my initial troubles with the idea
as dismissed by Jacques ---- then Jacques

adds a characterization of "left of center, suburban
college-educated professionals" as "the most
completely socialized segment of the american population"

does that make sense ?  i mean i hear him
and i think i understand what he's saying, but
i'm unsure where one gets their litmus for

~What socialization is supposed to be~ --- i can only
guess that the society controller-gnomes have
this shit down & their demographics bear him out

but what if you ascribe to the idea that there are
no society controller gnomes ???  or what if you
thought that the idea that if this segment

of the populace was the ~most~ anything it was
the most unable to see that it was in many respects
an anomaly in a large society none of which

can be said to be lacking in socialization ?
---- if this is the most socialized then the rest must
really be fucking up on the old social scale, no ?

but that's a digression, i don't think Jacques
is saying that at all ---- my confusion comes with
him being able to compass the whole enchilada at all

his 2nd point after stating that alt po and mainstream po
aint so radically unlike one another (all po after all)
maybe isnt a point at all but a hypothetical

 "...it might be more useful & interesting for poetry to
 make the symptoms of capitalism *exemplary* rather
 than to propose 'alternatives' or 'solutions' "

is this the proposed sillimanic 'solution' (sic) ?   it
seems that it from where he goes in 3. but i'm still
unsure what wd be so interesting about making

the symptoms of capitalism (everyone knows those right?)
exemplary in poetry --- what fuck wd that mean ?
[see my "In the Spirit of EX-" post for one take]

in 3. Jacques again repeats the "Silliman Solution" :
a "locally-oriented poetic" --- saying "[it] strikes me as
 extremely, if unintentionally, conservative."

ignoring for a moment the fact that Silliman didnt
offer any "solution" , why wd Jacques D. think this ?
"for one thing, it would tend, of course, to leave in place

 the status quo ideological & aesthetic assumptions
 of more ambitiously positioned poetries like language
 (not coincidentally)."  so Silliman's "solution" (that

he didnt propose, have i said that yet ? that he said nothing
about the Local as solution to anything ?) is a pernicious
attempt by the reigning poetic dinosaurs to anaesthetize us

in our abject localism to further shore up any challenge
to LangPo dominance (was there an X-Files on this ?)
the most compelling explanation for this paranoia so far

is by reference to the "rugged individualist" character of
the "american spirit" and the collective fear and suspicion
of groups but as neatly as that does seem to account

for say Jacques' posting a month or so ago attacking
the APG out of (for me at least) a clear blue sky ---
somewhere in the midst of which he said that so

naming ourselves was "naive and self-aggrandizing"
(which may be the title of the 1st APG anthology, by
the way) --- back to Debrot; "this is particularly evident

for instance w/ the more noticeably regional poetic
groupings like apg--  which, although it produces interesting
work, is in an extremely unoriginal position vis langpo"

seeing this the APG legal counsel wrote to the group;
"most of you probably saw this already but [i]* thought
 it was interesting (...)  we're being situated in an argument

 which im not sure we belong in yet anyway- ie im not sure
 we are old enough to have a position (even an uninteresting
 one) yet (and i dont think our stuff in mirage or on this list

 is enough to base an opinion on) good to know we are
 in his head ? plus its interesting to me to associate local
 with atlanta anyway since like dallas and l.a. (although l.a.

 is unique and might not quite fit) atlanta is really
 an anti-locus and always has been all the way
 from the people down to the city layout

 have a happy new year im heading down to the local swamps
 buffy"  --- attached were some legal do's and don't
for the PR Smear campaign that we're launching to link

Jacques Debrot invariably in the public mind with "ill will,
 the worst pretensions of criticism, hate groups,
 pedophilia and tax evasion" --- luckily the T-shirt sale

will easily cover the cost of this (and as a poetic it
neatly exemplifies the symptoms of capitalism, no?)
but to return to the actual words of Jacques post

why wd having some sense of localism in various
location around the country / world "tend to leave in place
the status quo" etc ??  didn't (the Evil) LangPo

start as a local thing in the bay area & in NYC
and then make its mythical meteoric rise to
"acadominance" --- where wd one start if one was

(simply for the sake of argument) jockeying for position
-vs- "more ambitiously positioned poetries" ?
well,... in the capitalism media one strategy wd be

to demonize and dismiss ---- for instance insinuating
that someone like Ron Silliman's avowed interest in
the 'local' was cover for solidifying his own power

what power doesnt really matter --- you just have to say it
and it primes the audience to remember it to associate it
--- this wd neatly exemplify one symptom or stratagem

of capitalism ---- a "debrotian poetic" embodied ?
i should have said "critical poetic" as from what i know of
Jacques' poetry, it, like mine and everyone else's

wdn't get ya 10 cents on any street corner and in the
capitalist world wherein we dwell aint worth squat
(which is part of why i find it valuable actually)

but the what if's multiply rapidly for me; What if
you don't think there is any real poetic status quo ?
What if yr interest in poetry doesn't entail

generational battles ?  What if you don't think
"Language Poetry" describes poetry but
a large and amorphous group of very distinct poets ?

What if you (gasp) actually like the work of
Charles Bernstein, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman
but don't feel that their shadow reaches you at all

much less than anyone need feel they are dwelling
in it ?  What if ...... ????  so, getting back to the posting
Jacques using his omnipovision and a startlingly

small amount of input data (the APG issue of Mirage)
was able to blithely state that we (i am one recall)
are in a 'most unoriginal position vis lang po'

Mark P. my APG comrade has posted some "distinctions"
that he felt were important to share in the face of this
and i'm fine with those i s'pose but rather than

disavowing LangPo i'd like to say that i like many
of those poets and that i was very powerfully effected by
some of Bernstein's essays, Rosmarie Waldrop's poetry,

(is she langpo ? does she know ? should we tell her ?)
by Gertrude Stein (honorary langpo right ? anyway)
Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson, Clark Coolidge  (but is he...)

cataloging gets tiresome after awhile but what i'm saying
is that i liked all that stuff and it hit mea moment when
i was just trying to figure out what i was up to

in an initial and temporary way --- my explanation wd be
that this is good poetry rather than that i've bought into
some sort of post-language group think

(no disrespect to those who've chosen the term
"post-language" --- it's not a name i wd relish
but to each her own)  but of course i'd like to think

i like that stuff b/c its good --- isn't that exactly
what a well brainwashed and anaesthetized localist
poet in a very unoriginal position vis langpo wd think ?

APG false consciousness (from an email) "langpo has
 turned into this big dusty file cabinet that someone is still
 cramming files into because it seems better than allowing

 the 'miscellaneous' box to fill up."  (oh, and did i tell you
that the Atlanta Poetry Group is the official Poetry
Group of the 21st Century ? ..oh... you knew)

Jacques then turns to the boston scene and dubs it
as "largely frozen in an olsonian aesthetic."  ---- i
can only say WOW, to be so knowledgeable

and so willing to share --- i'm sure the folks
in beantown are pleased to know where they stand
just as much as we here in @lanta are

so what now ?  well in spite of Jacques' dismissal
of "alternatives" and "solutions" he has something of
a cure "what exp poetry needs is in fact an "outside"

 -- an alternative, just for a start, to all the *puffing*
 that constitutes the critical discourse (for what
 it's worth) that surrounds it."  --- oops i guess he

does say that this Outside wd be an 'alternative'
--- pity that the omnipovision either doesnt tell him
anything meaningful about this outside or does

but he's unwilling to share with us yucks out in
the sticks -- but then i do wonder what if anything
his post is if not critical *puffing* --- that is

"puffing by exclusion" (i forget the latin for it)
--- Jacques again: "indeed, rather than the chaos
 of proliferating books & presses, the reception

 of alt poetry & its relationship to its audience
 seems more & more regulated by
 networks of affiliation structured by

 a.) apprentiships
 by emerging poets
 to more established writers

 & b.) accreditation/initiation in/by graduate writing
 &/or english depts at buffalo, brown, naropa,
 san diego, etc." [Harvard anyone ?]

there is some truth in this i'm sure
there is a sense in which the critical discourse
mediates between audience and readers

and certainly given my druthers i'd prefer that
this not be the case (enough of critics out of harvard
ignore them!) or at least not be "increasingly"

the case --- but then again i'm willing in to state
openly in the forum that i like Marjorie Perloff's books
i don't always agree with her conclusions

or understand how she makes certain turns in her
arguments --- but i still like them --- is the complaint that
some poets arent smart enough to make up

their own minds ?  and that those foolish enough
to attend a writing or english program are actually
paying to be indoctrinated  ? and if this is true

what should we do ?  if this is how one ought look at it
then the problem seems to be how the smart ones of us
those that realize their cattle status and weak minds

can (in a blessed aristocratic gesture) enlighten
the rest of us (that wd be me) as to the judgements
of our own uberbovines, our own omnipovisonary

cud chewing betters --- a tough one all around
but one thing we do know ---- don't talk to anyone about
yr ideas to help this situation --- grouping is

right out ---- henceforth everything from the barbershop
quartets to the national association of women
must remain pure and individual in hopes a stimulating

an original position vis a vis the flow of hot air /////
and with that i conclude my tour --- other people said
things that i liked and which were very reasonable i thought

but this is already the longest post i have ever made
to poetics and who knows it may even be rejected
and so before going i wd like to say hello and thanks

to all the folks i've met and interacted with here
i'd love to list names but that wd take even longer and
i wdnt want anyone else tainted with APG connections

what i wd like to know about are other listservs
if anyone cd send me info backchannel about interesting ones
i'd also be game to start one up so if anyone

is interested in trying out something like that
on a small scale, lemme know, but remember:
backchannel, as i am, in accordance with

my new years resolution signing off of the poetics list
but keep yr eyes peeled for more APG wanking
"so long, farewell, her feet are stained, goodbyee"

I hesitate to add to this thread because as a scholar I feel a little naked
without my fig-leafed references and footnotes in front of me, but what the
hell.  I'm among poets, if not friends.

But in fact there is an enormous literature among cultural anthropologists on
'magical hair', correlating hair and sexual prowess.  So that shaving
indicates restraint, asceticism, the accumulation of yogic power, or chi, or
chastity, etc.  I think that this association can be found in classical China
and Japan, certainly in classical India, in Greece and Rome, in the Old
Testament, etc. [perhaps only god knows where else, or perhaps everywhere,
else].  I think that Stith Thompson might have quite a lot on magical hair in
his index of folklore motifs.  But I can't go and look [too lazy/busy].

Just for one example, I recently reviewed a book on the erotics of riddling
in which there is discussion of the Biblical Queen of Sheba whose hairy legs
identified her as an awesome, powerful witch [she was also a good riddler,
not unrelated, to be sure]. Of course, there is also the Samson and Delilah
scenario.nearby....

Subject:      the local outside
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

jacques, brian, et al.,

some thots on the outside and the local sparked by yr recent posts; i
relate here some recent poetry-related experiences and the ways in which
i think/hope they tie in at several places in the discussion.

first, i agree completely with jacques on the following:

        "2.  alternative poetries are not diametrically dissimilar to
        mainstream poetry, but actually share/reproduce many of the
        symptoms of this crisis-in-complacency.  this is not, however,
        necessarily a *bad* thing [. . .] "

part of the symptom is an unflinching acceptance of terms in which the
alternative defines itself oppositionally to the mainstream. this
strikes me as fundamental and one of several things that i immensely
dislike about the beach book, namely how if you take oppositionality as a
given, and specifically one pole's terms for positing that
oppositionality, it becomes impossible to discern anything that might
frustrate that oppositionality such as, for example, the fact that many
emerging alternative poets cut their teeth in the much-demonized
university creative writing program, as jacques suggests here:

        "the reception of alt poetry & its relationship to its audience
        seems more & more regulated by networks of affiliation structured
        by a.) apprentiships by emerging poets to more established writers
        & b.) accreditation/initiation in/by graduate writing &/or english
        depts at buffalo, brown, naropa, san diego, etc."

this may be one of the most important facets of current alternative
poetries, but it simply can't be admitted into the discussion as long as
the m.f.a. program is universally opposed. and again i think jacques is
right, the modes of production embraced by the alternative may very well
be much closer to those of the mainstream than the alternative would want
to admit.  thus i'd rather than assume radically opposite mechanisms for
cultural production assume homologous mechanisms and then try to specify
differences from there.

we're approaching a point, if not already there, where the alternative
exhausts its conceptual resources -- or at least the efficaciousness of
those resources begins to wither -- in persisting with a tried-and-true
and hence simplistic oppositionality.  hence, i think, brian's "we don't
have a heck of lot of ideas these days."

second, i'm doubtful that the ideas are going to come by constructing, as
jacques suggests, an "outside," partly because I'm not sure what such an
"outside" would look like or constitute, and partly because of the way
that the disciples of foucault blanchot bataille et al. tend to
uncritically assume some radicality of the "outside."  i think there needs
to be a continual, what, reconnoitering?, between the poles, a movement
to an outside that is then followed up by a renewed view inside...

maybe some "local" anecdotes are in order here.

first, was watching the new year's eve festivities on the mall in d.c. --
on the tube about ten miles away at my sister's in suburban maryland, yes
i succumbed to the insinuations of terrorist attacks but what can i say
from where i was the view the temperature and the food were terrific --
and everyone actually is gathered around the tube as midnight approaches
and spielberg's thing is wrapping up and on comes pinsky to give the
requisite poem-bite, and somebody asks who's that? and i reply without
missing a beat robert pinsky knowing full well that no one in this room
full of intellegent people has any idea who robert pinsky is.  who's he
someone asks and i say he's our current poet laureate.  everyone is of
course astounded at this and they wonder how i know this and someone says
well he *does* work in an english department, and my brother-in-law adds
not only that but tom actually does things like go to poetry readings a
lot.  (end of scenario, enter maya angelou.)

second. my co-worker asks me one morning how was the poetry reading given
by jean donnelly that i went to the previous night.  and i said it was
great, that her work is really terrific, that everyone in attendance
agreed, etc.  my co-worker wants to know more, she asks how jean's work
compares to that of others in the department, and i of course fall back on
the old "experimental" and "alternative" tags.  smartly, she senses that
these are tags and asks further, about poetry slams and is this work like
or unlike that.  no, that's something else, but i try to get into that a
little bit, then the Beats, performance, etc.  then she asks a really
good question, about if there are a lot of women involved in this
alternative stuff, but then work interrupts and conversation ends.

point being, i think, that in either case it's immensely difficult to add
not even nuance or shading but any color at all to the grey morass that
is the general perception of poetry. should more people know who the poet
laureate is, would it increase his fan base if pinsky published in the new
yorker, and if i know who he is am i thereby implicated as a fan and if
not how to explain why i'm not.

what is my responsibility here -- mine or anyone else's for whom poetry
matters?  what are the *real* choices between big group hugs and trenchant
oppositionality? -- neither of which i think are particularly feasible or
desirable.

hence i think the value in making forays through the poles, precisely
to suspend my own predilications and get into another reader's head and
try to identify the appeal. like, third, frank bidart gave a reading at
the folger which i did not attend but a line from which has provoked
endless hilarity among us devotees of the alternative: "the tapeworm
was her soul."  it's a serious exercise to suspend one's immediate
response and try to figure out exactly in what sense of poetry does such a
line register an affirmative.  i can't quite wrap my head around it and
i'd love nothing more than for some to "make a case" for it to me.

fourth. a reading put on in the experimental series at the d.c. arts
center, two poets who teach in a local university english department. both
took an enormous amount of time "setting up" their work.  the first
curiously divided the audience into those familiar/unfamiliar with the
work (which struck us as those with/not-with the university program), part
of which dealt at length with the poet's coming-to-terms with her mother's
terminal illness, the other part being a collaboration with the work of a
local visual artist who deals with domestic issues through the use
of glycerin and lead.  the second poet's work was an extensive foray into
family history, the ancestors who had emigrated here and turned out to be
not all the wonderful people that family legend suggested. this is a real
nutshell recounting and i've oversimplified a great deal. but our
discussions afterward revolved around the terms in which to think about
the work: the "quality of emotion," mode of engagement with another
artform, the de facto validity of history?  none of which anyone
was very comfortable with...

i guess i'm trying to back up brian's
        "idea of there being a constant soiling or corrupting of this
        purity, that there is no outside but running among the corridors
        of the "inside"."
i want pure oppositionalities to be soiled, corrupted.

this applies also to the local (vs. what, global? non-local?). the local
is interesting to me primarily insofar as it extends beyond itself and
thus sullies any pure local-ness it might want to claim.  all the
activities of the local scene here in d.c. might as well take place in a
vacuum if there is no attempt to extend the locality, to get people here
to read from philly, nyc, atlanta, to cross over into and do collaborative
work with the visual arts community, etc.

so i don't know that the local as a framework has been exhausted, but it
certainly needs rethinking.  apparently its langpo residues seem to be
clinging to our friends in atlanta, but there is a confusion i think over
whether that residue is of the nature of the works themselves or of the
positioning of the group as locality.  brian referred to "a sort of
ghost double of *some of the gestures* of language poetry," jacques to
the apg's "extremely unoriginal *position* vis langpo" (my emphases).  so
it's not, as i see it, the work but the positioning that might be
considered unoriginal (members of a loosely-affiliated group of writers
who read and engage with each others work while disavowing any specific
shared aesthetics, etc.; but the means of intervention are certainly
unique: a san fran 'zine picks them up and disseminates 135 issues
nationwide thru a buffalo poetics promo!)

but then again, to continue with brian's turn of phrase, i want an
originality that is thoroughly sullied by the derivative.  duncan was
definitely onto something there...

bests,
tom

OK, so you were ignorant, and as a result you made a mistake.  At such a
junction you have several options - apologize, hide, or explain the mistake
away.  I think the proper choice is evident.  Show some humility, apologize.
  And the choice you made was way off the mark.

Your joke is clearly about stupidity, (two glasses, one full, as options for
drinking or not drinking?  C'mon pal, you sound like Jimmy the Greek with
such a charade) and you could have admitted you made a mistake.  But you
seem to be defending something in the name of, well, what is it in the name
of?  Pride?  Would it be too much to ask you to be secure enough to
acknowledge that either a) you made a mistake or b) you honestly cling to
the notion that Irishmen are stupid (or drunks, as you teased us with in
another post).

How can one be completely ignorant of sentiments like the Irish as "niggers
turned inside out" just as blacks were called "smoked Irish"?  If you can
imagine African Americans would not like to hear that, well, then you may
start to understand.  Or how about names like . . . barks, bog trotters,
boiled dinners, Celts, chaws, chaw mouths, dogans, flannelmouths,
greenlanders, harps, Hibernians, mackerel snappers, Micks, narrow backs,
paddies, Patlanders, salt water turkeys, spuds, teagues, terriers, Turks?

Have you never heard of the time of history in America where Irish and
African Americans were treated equally, but only as equal to each other, and
together both below everyone else?  "Niggers and Irishmen need not apply"?
Or other aspects of the legacy of British oppression of the Irish?  Or the
fact that most people in the South in the US are of Irish decent and NOT of
British decent, as they like to fantasize of themselves as somehow being
related to the deliverers of slavery and aristocracy to the SE US?

From 1695 until 1793, the Penal Laws imposed by your ancestors, the British,
denied most Irish to any education at all.  Enforced law.  Thereafter,
schooling was run by Christian Brthers and Ursuline Sisters.  Not a very
good way to stimulate intellectual growth in a country.

OK, so you didn't know this was a soft spot.  Cannot you just apologize?

And the passive aggressive stuff in implying a contrast between Dutch and
Irish is not a clever tactic - "ability to laugh at themselves."

I was born and raised in america and was acutely aware of this stereotype of
the Irish, as many well-educated people are.

<<In future, I shall make sure that my jokes all begin "An Esperantese, a
Venutian and a Martian were discoursing in a bar...." --But then won't I be
told that the latter two types are gender-coded?>>

And so you add insult to injury?  Where is your compassion, your ability to
fathom?

I did not find the joke insulting so much as stupid and blissfully ignorant.

C'mon David.

Hi Brian,

Please excuse a belated response to one of the points you responded to in a
series of letters I read with interest and pleasure. I refer to the claim
that poetry has become a minor genre.
I'm sure this is the case in Australia, and, to varying degrees, in most
Western democracies. I'm not so sure about Russia or South America (I've
heard of poetry festivals there that draw thousands) or China etc. This is
not an idle point. If we look at societies in which poetry does play a major
role in the life of the people, I think we can understand why it fails to do
so in the West. In a society like that of my Irish forebears some thousand
years ago, the bard had a valued position in society because poetry
fulfilled important functions - history, philosophy, myth, entertainment -
which
today are taken over, in the day to day life of the majority, by mass media.
The fact that the media is so visually oriented exacerbates the problem.
Similarly, the way in which the media dictates the time span of the
viewer/listener's experience might make it difficult to adapt to the
different way in which reading a poem operates in time.
(That point's purely off the top of my head - I could be way off beam.).
The way I see it, it's because poetry has been squeezed out of its
traditional functions (plus, perhaps, a certain loss of faith in high
culture - of which, more later) that it has come to occupy this minor role,
and not because of the the nature of what is written (although I'm not sure
that helps). People will argue that poetry needs to become more accessible,
to reach out to Old Hundred Names, but if large sections of the population
are not reading poetry, it's not because they don't like what is being
written - they don't even read what's being written. Poetry simply doesn't
play a part in their lives, just as it doesn't play a part (except in rare
circumstances) in reality as mediated through the TV and radio.
Trying out another position - if the majority are not interested in poetry,
isn't that also a reflection of the deficiencies of mainstream poetry,
rather than experimental work which is not easily come by. Certainly, it's
not what one is exposed to in schools and I
think most of those who don't read poetry have acquired their dislike of it
in school. (and it can be this strong - as a school teacher, I come across
it all the time and with poetry more than any other aspect of English - on
the other hand, the art teachers encounter no such difficulties in teaching
about Surrealism etc. - sorry, got
sidetracked) This is due in part to the method of approach to a poem which
is taught - close textual analysis - the focus on 'meaning' - (I could get
sidetracked again so easily) but must also be a reflection on the texts
studied - absolute mainstream with Eliot as a token (naturally I'm referring
to Australia here and would be interested to hear what sort of poetry is
taught in American schools - are they any more adventurous?).
Another question - earlier I referred to high culture, and poetry, whatever
the intentions of some of its practitioners, is identified with that area.
In an age when popular culture dominates our impression of the world and the
attitudes of many of its inhabitants, high culture has become the lesser
partner, more prestigious perhaps and, to varying degrees, the preserve of
elites (into a tricky area) but not, well, popular. This may appear as a
decline,that poetry  "has become" less than it was, but high culture is, by
definition, the culture of an elite/elites and thus of a minority. Popular
culture has always existed but it has not always been reported on, so our
impressions of periods of history where poetry seemed in some golden age,
for example the English Romantics (not a personal favourite), may be quite
false. Perhaps, in lieu of movie stars and rock singers, some poets might
have attained fame but did the proportion of people who read their work
differ significantly from the proportion of people who read poetry in
England today? I'm not even sure that can be answered, but I think it's
worth mentioning as many statements about 'the state of poetry today' are
based on some perception, possibly false, about the state of poetry in the
past.
One last point - I mentioned Celtic Ireland earlier as an instance of a
society in which the poet has a unique and important function, if we
consider briefly a contemporary example I think it may lead us to Brian's
question (I can't do it justice) about the sublime and cruelty. I'm
referring to Russia in the period in which it was the USSR (any reports on
the current state of poetry in Russia?) My impression is that poetry
mattered there in ways it simply can't here or in the US or England - again,
it is in part because of the function it performed. Even a poorly written
samizdat poem might
have some force because of the nature of the action.
And this may be where poetry shows its true colours, for it is surely one of
the few resources available to the oppressed. It doesn't even require
materials for its production or transmission, we may make our poems and
teach them to others who will pass them on in turn. Being a little less
romantic, typewriters, roneo machines,photocopiers, even publishers can be
found and the results distributed privately. Poetry, we might say, is the
natural voice of the revolutionary whereas television is the natural voice
of the status quo. If people accept the status quo (mustn't grumble)then I
guess they'll be happy enough with TV.  (This could be too stark - I am not
unilaterally in favour of revolutionaries and opposed to all status (stati?)
quo.)
So, is this where cruelty comes in? do we need to be stripped of possessions
and liberties to realise that we still have poetry? (This has a particular
pertinence in Australia, we had to go all the way to Turkey and France to
experience anything approaching national trauma.) I don't accept the notion
that we need cruelty/egotism/
intolerance from poets, especially in the interests of making them more
interesting, but it may be that we need to experience or at least admit to
the presence of evil in the world if our poetry is to approach the sublime.
A final comment - if we're reduced to an audience that loves poetry for its
own sake, is that such a bad thing?

All the best, Geraldine McKenzie

Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Judy Roitman wrote:
>I know workshop poetry when I see it, but what are the boundaries of

Bob Archambeau wrote:
For my purposes (as editor) I go by what Nataniel Tarn has to say about it
in his essay in Jacket:
(http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket09/tarn-on-paz.html).  Disjoined
syntax as a central trope, or that becomes a mannerism, or
"disjunctivitis."  A bit limited, but it works for me.

I write:
Hrm. I just returned from The Coffee Bean Cafe and Tarn's essay, and while I
agree with much of what he has to say, I would like to give some defense to
the use of "fragmentation", as well as ponder a bit regarding a "postmodern"
poetry.

First of all, I find it amusing that Tarn managed to get through that entire
essay without once saying "postmodern". While the word is enough to make
most (honest) people cringe, I think that there are some important questions
that need to be addressed with regards to the postmodern. Particularly, what
might a postmodern poetry be like, and what would serve as legitimation in
it, what would "vouch for its authenticity?"

While it is arguable that the effects of postmodernism are probably more
prominent among academians than in the general populace, that is the
cultural world I feel I live in, and thus the experiential one which I must
try to "make articulate" as Creeley might say. It is perhaps paradoxical to
try to construct narratives amid a "crisis of narratives" as Lyotard calls
it, but this is what people do, this is a way we read meaning into our
experience.

So why all the fragmentation? Because when trying to articulate the
postmodern, that's one way to do it. Fragmentation of experience, meaning,
culture, etc-- these are all an important part of the postmodern world many
of us live in. Younger poets (myself included) are influenced by media
saturation which delivers its messages and stories in visual and narrative
chunks and fragments. Attention spans shorten. In another sense, actual
Disjunctivitis might be seen as a symptom of an excess of postmodern anxst
over the breakdown of modernist metanarratives. (also: Paz's note of
"imitation masquerading as originality, invention, and innovation" is not
surprising; postmodern society very much into "recycling", the new VW Bugs,
for example)

What I'm saying is that this isn't all just eccentricity for its own sake;
there is a purpose in the fragmentation of language to some degree, or at
least a cause. When such fragmentation become totally inarticulate, there's
a problem. Yet skepticism about knowledge and the ability of anything to be
"true" (or articulate) is at the very heart of a postmodern poetry. It isn't
enough to write typical verse with postmodern subject matter or concerns;
these concerns must be taken up, must be at issue, in the language itself.

Which leads us to legitimation. Self-reflexivity is certainly the pragmatic
"high point" of postmodernism, although many bad postmodernists (read:
"cultural studies") tend to gloss over it.

"But I do feel poems to involve an occasion to which a man pays obedience,
and which intentions alone never yield."
-Robert Creeley, "Poems are a Complex" 1965 (reproduced in -Claims for
Poetry- ed. Donald Hall)

"Poems are like children and have minds and manners of their own, luckily
beyond the control of parents and poets." -Bin Ramke

There comes a point in many poems--some might say all--where the language
decides to say or do something the poet hadn't expected. Bizzare tangents,
uncomfortable realizations. So does one listen to the language, or does one
try to control it? It is my own hope to try to make this "point" not a point
but a constant process of listening. By surrendering some of my intention, I
might just learn something. Death of the author? Not exactly. Just a
realization that the author is a flawed, biased individual who would perhaps
do well to be a bit more humble. One might note as well that this
surrendering of intention to language might account for some of these
peculiarities (such as fragmentation). The style and form of language in
such a postmodern poetry is an important part of this listening.

Thus, postmodern legitimation might include the surrendering of intention to
language, a close styling of form to content (if one can even presume to
separate them), and a certain self-deprecation regarding the author's role
in the poem--a generosity of sorts in which one opens oneself up to being
imperfect and positioned.

What's perhaps most strange is the way in which faith and authenticity
spring not from a belief in the ability of one to directly articulate
through language, but in a belief that language is subversive--"Damn
subversive." as Wayne Dodd gruffly agreed with me--and can subvert our
intentions and take us to something self-reflexive and perhapseven
(gasp)"true." Seeing and hearing this subversiveness, letting the language
in a sense deconstruct itself, is one way this legitimation plays itself
out.

Well, I don't have a brilliant closing for this and it is very late here.
Despite the extensive use of many large, latinate words, I don't claim to be
certain of any of this or to have any comprehensive grasp of the current
"scene" as it were. Hopefully this will server as food for thought and
discussion, though...

-Matthew Blevins, another poet-anthropologist (whose theory is probably more
interesting than his poetry?)

        Listmates, stop the presses. Ignore my recent post, "knowing what a
joke means." The Irish woman who helped raise me came to me in a dream last
night. She told me "That joke, Davey? It's about being stupid." I remember
that I tried to reason with her, gave her a precis of my prior post on this
topic. Might even have pointed out to her it was a matter of opinion.

"You always were a clever lad," she told me, "But sometimes, you were too
clever by half."

"Yes, Mother Mary," I said, submissively.

"You have done that boy Billy an injury. I want you to stand up like a man
and say you're sorry in front of the whole school." I saw we were in a
schoolroom, with tiny desks, and that Mary Murphy was the teacher.

"I will, Mother," I told her. "Don't leave yet---there's so much I want to
ask you!"

"Yes, Davey?"

"Is it really you, or...?"

"What do you think?" She reached over and grasped my arm.

"Thank you, thank you! I have another question."

"I don't have time, Davey."

In heaven---do people laugh in the case of mistaken identity?"

"Only the saints, Davey. Now go to sleep, there's a good boy." I found I
was in my little bed, on Sumatra Road in West Hampstead. Then I went to
sleep. Then I woke up.

I am sorry I hurt your feelings, Billy,,,and perhaps those of other Irish
on this list. Or, and which is a very different matter, stupid persons,
come to that.

This whole thread makes me think of Barry Levinson's latest Baltimore
movie, Liberty Heights. It's the most good humoured, generous treatment
of race, religion and class in the US that I think I've ever seen. It
begins with three young Jewish boys in 1954 facing a sign on a WASP
swimming pool that says No Jews, Dogs or Coloreds. Their response is to
try to figure out why whoever made the sign chose that order. It's
hilarious. But of course some people have no interest in bringing either
humour or generosity to these issues.

As a response to MDamon's last post on 'baby' and the more extraordinary
posts on this subject (MDamon's was not nearly as ridiculous as some of the
other posts, and she protected herself by telling us that someone was
relaying this information to her and that she was merely delivering it to
us). . .

<<ive been told by an animal behaviorist that humans are prematurely born>>

that sounds like somewhat of a misnomer, since prematurity is based on ONE
species' average .   are we humans premature in comparison to chimpanzees?
a human at 9 mos. is not premature just because a chimp takes 12 mos (or
however long a chimp takes).  what the behaviorist said makes no sense.
unless he means something like, humans have begun to force delivery of
babies before gestation is complete.  but even then. prematurity is an
unlikely conclusion.

it might be better to say that _h. Sapiens_ has one of the longest known
neotenous periods, neoteny being the dependance of an infant on its mother
(or father).  which extends our period of childishness considerably, perhaps
indefinitiely.

the god of man is child.

<<and that that accounts for some of our mating behavior like kissing, or
erotic attraction to the female breast, which is not found in other parts of
the mammalian kingdom or even among our cousin primates.  this wd account
for all manner of regressive behavior during courtship rituals, including
mutual infantilization through rhetoric.>>

it may be mammalian, not merely human, since my two kittens like to try to
groom my mouth and fingers when I come home and just before I go to sleep, a
sort of kissing.  they are certainly being affectionate but kissing is
neither limited to the phenomenon of the erotic nor to the lot of humans.

i think 'erotic' attraction, namely, pinpointing what 'erotic' is, is quite
difficult to witness or measure in other species, and challenging to
describe without some first-person experiences, which are by definition
beyond the range of behavioralism.  As a result, I would find a comparative
analysis between species, well, specious.

there may be a more sufficient approach than a behaviorist one to kissing or
mammary fixation or use of the word 'baby.'

or let's say a hammer is used as a tool (a) to build a house and (b)for
murder.  let's also assume some guy named Harry is building a house, hammer
in hand.  Would we say that Harry, having never employed a hammer for any
violent actions, is partaking of a homicidal action?  would we say that a
hammer represents homicidal inclinations even when used to build a house?  i
think the answer is clear.

similarly, 'baby' might be used in two different ways, and there seems no
imperative to deduce that the use in one way automatically implies use of
the word in the other way.  under most circumstances I doubt 'baby' partakes
of some sort of predatory pedophilia, as was suggested earlier in this
thread.

however, i do indeed think that sexuality works in all relationships,
whether lover, friend, or child-parent.  love sometimes becomes immersed in
cooperative living, mutual support, and perhaps even multiple child-parent
type relations between lovers.  why 'baby'?  maybe the sounds in 'baby' are
affectionate, sweet, gentle, and soothing to intimates of either variety --
parent-child and lovers.

i guess the main issue here is whether the meaning of a word at its coinage
is always implied in future uses.  Nietzsche obviously believed the answer
is 'yes,' or at least he built some important arguments on such a heuristic.
  i disagree strongly, as meanings are dynamic.  they shift from generation
to generation (diachronically), and even individuals may beleive at
different times in their lives that a particular word means different
things, or an individual will change his or her use of a word over a
lifetime.  And even synchronically speaking, there may be different meanings
for different people, different usages, etc.  if 'baby' were initially used
in the sense we are talking about as a word of sexual objectification, it
does not mean that most people today intend it the same way.  but new
orleans certainly IS a strange town, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
OK, maybe a bit less humidity in the summer.

Also, the meaning of a word seems to be distorted even by its immediate
surroundings.  So it is plausible that 'baby,' used in some song and sung to
a lover, means something completely different than 'baby' in the same song
but actualy sung to a child.

I find it safe to say, language is very complicated.

And pedophilia is obviously an ingrained aspect of human behavior, even if
in a minority.  But 'baby' said to a lover does not necessarily partake of
pedophilic inclinations.

In my collosal naivete I actually misunderstood this joke, not as
illustration of stupidity, but of a sort of surrealist, magical logic
perhaps characteristic of Irishmen and -women and poets. I propose
revising the joke as follows:

Why did Andre Breton leave a full and an empty glass by his bedside?
etc...

It also reminds me of the story of the monk in China who hires a man to
row him across a lake.  When they are almost to the other side, the monk
asks his rower to take him back, since he, the monk, doesn't want to go
there anymore. This seems illogical to those of us who would say "well, I
might as well go all the way to the other side, since I've gotten this
far." But why do something you don't want to do just because you've
started it?

Marla, I think the power thing is almost always part of the equation (or
in-equation).  I guess age of consent laws happen because "we have to draw
the line somewhere," but it (perhaps/hopefully with lawmakers' knowledge?)
remains flawed (& reductive & potentially harmful) to assume that once a
person gets past a certain age s/he will be able to consent any better than
a younger person (not that *you* assume this; the law does).  Power can come
into play between two same-sex financially-equal identical in ht/wt
same-race partners in their 40's.  Some people are sexually "powerless"
their whole lives; some never are.

I don't think pedophilia, in its "pure" form (it's all relative), is about
attraction to powerlessness.  One can find powerless enough people in legal
age groups anywhere one looks.  I think it is about attraction to children's
bodies, period; I really do.  Anything else is just something glommed on to
pedophilia, the way, say, a fetish or a tendency toward sadism can glom on
to good ol' innocuous heterosexuality.  I do not think pedophiles are
attracted to children because they're "easy marks," or because they're easy
to keep quiet.  Many adults are these things; many kids aren't.  I guess I
think of it this way: when I was a kid, I was attracted to both kids my own
age and adults (celebrity adults, usually).  It does not seem unreasonable
to me, therefore, that one might be attracted to both as an adult (or
neither, or only one).  That pedophilia acted out harms (can harm) children
is not an attraction for "normal" pedophiles...it's a cause for grief, or
shame, or quite possibly disbelief (the pedophile thinks he's "in love" and
that the kid must be, too...perhaps a bit like the de Clarembeaut's [sp?]
syndrome captured in Ian McEwan's "Enduring Love")

As this is admittedly not very interesting, I'll sign off--

I'd just like to say that my own definition of the local is not
automatically one linked by geography. I think that there are other types of
intensive/intended collaborations that might equally qualify. Although I do
think that the face-to-face element of the scene vs. the network really
helps in detoxifying the paranoia which sometimes lurks up in more distant
interactions (the history of this list being a pretty decent example of
same). Reading the history of Black Mountain College, particularly in
relation to people who were not always "present" (Duncan and Creeley both
there only for short periods, Levertov not really at all, Eigner never),
brings up lots of things to think about over just such dynamics.

hello to everyone doing this thread,

brian, you write:

>> . . . But this idea of the state of crisis in "mainstream" poetry

could have many factors, one of which is that the glory days of this

"mainstream" -- Lowell, Berryman, Bishop, etc. -- still maintained some very

close ties to modernism and its myths, not to mention the figures of

modernism in their presence (Thomas, Auden, Stein a little bit even, the

ever-looming Pound, Eliot, and even Williams for those like Jarrell who

accepted him).  They could derive some excitement from that, and feel a part

of the "age of anxiety" even if in socially unchallenging teaching jobs.

Now, that thrill is to be found in their own peers whom they, by nature,

have to ignore -- i.e. "us," the so-called experimental wing<<

i agree w/ you substantially, but w/ this revision:  just happening, by
chance, to see norman podhoretz being interviewed on c-span the other day, it
really struck me how much the various literary circles radiating out from
commentary, the partisan review & the new critical journals identified
*themselves* as being the representatives of the avant-garde in relation to
mainstream culture, rather than in some sense, as you suggest, getting a
contact high from the presence of auden, thomas, etc.  so that when
podhoretz, as i was saying, looks back at the fifties he sees *himself & his
friends* as having embodied "the most radical & advanced political &
aesthetic thought of the day."  i mean, while you & i, for example--almost
w/out thinking about it--would link the nys painters to o'hara and the
others, remember, greenberg was writing about pollock  for the partisan
review crowd which also strongly  identified w/ the aesthetic aims of ab
ex--&, it seems to me, in a much less complicated way than the nys poets.
what changed all of this was vietnam & post structuralist philosophy.  the
lang poets were, from my point of view (it almost goes w/out saying),
absolutely on the right side in both instances.  &, too, borges-wise, i think
it's possible that the influence of the lang poets has migrated backwards in
a way, so that retrospectively, o'hara  looks more av-garde to us today than
he did to his contemporaries  (after all, the reviews he received in the 50s
didn't put him down for being too experimental, but for being too
lightweight).

one of the added complications of the present situation however is that both
the modernists's & the new crits relationship to their audiences was not
nearly as conflicted as "ours" is--we each are writing for elites,  the
modernists embraced that idea--"we" are deeply troubled by it.  it never
mattered, then, for them, in the same way that it does for us, that our
readers are only those who are already, overwhelmingly, in complicity with us
aesthetically & politically.  for this reason (&, from my perspective, other
reasons i don't have time to go into now) the difficulties obstructing exp
poetry's having any cultural relevance at all seem practically intractable.
i tend to be as pessimistic about it as bruce andrews who writes "this is the
most invisible avant-garde" (quoting roughly from memory).

about blake / reynolds, too--this is an excellent case of how outside/inside
dichotomies can be misleading.  rather than being "the most outside"  blake
essentially shares reynolds concerns, but in a form that is so eccentric that
this might not at first be entirely obvious.  blake, for example, was just as
much caught up as reynolds was in the chauvinistic idea of the development of
a uniquely british art & exhibited the same feelings of over-compensating
inferiority toward continental artists which subtended the dominant english
aesthetic ideolgy of the period.

i think you are probably right though in seeing in my desire for an "outside"
a buried nostalgia for some fantasmal objective cultural authority--a feeling
i definitely want to keep in check--but don't you ever feel that way?
naively, perhaps, what i had in mind was the situation of the visual arts &,
more specifically,  i was influenced by the latest artforum in which
something like 15 art scholars listed their favorite exhibitions of the year.
 now i know about all of the corruptions, compromises, etc. etc. in the
artworld, but i was still impressed by the fact that there was an audience
for contemp visual art (which is almost generically experimental) that
includes people as impressive as krauss, and buchloh, and foster, and martin
jay, and bryson, and jacqueline rose, etc. etc.-- but nothing like that for
exp poetry.  indeed, when artforum does cover contemp poetry in the bookforun
supplement, it's often the blandest variety.  thank god for maria damon,
joseph conte, perloff, altieri, shoptaw--but even they, for the most part,
don't ever write about anything more recent than lang poetry.  & it is (a
little) dissapointing that when someone like jacqueline rose does write about
poetry she writes about sylvia plath (even if i am a plath fan).  the lang
poets are probably the best am poet/critics of the century, but there is a
tendency to take them entirely on their terms & so our inheritance of their
work -- and all of its possible or most counter-intuitive implications-- is
diminished.  it's (particularly) presjnar's too simple understanding of lang
poetry & his very easy  & uncomplicated adoption of oppositional terms & the
way in which this is manifested in his poems-- that i object to.

re your second point, let me just repeat what tom orange has just said much
better than i did:  "the modes of production embraced by the alternative may
very well
be much closer to those of the mainstream than the alternative would want
to admit.  thus i'd rather than assume radically opposite mechanisms for
cultural production assume homologous mechanisms and then try to specify
differences from there."

this post is already too long & i haven't yet addressed several remarks of
yours brian that point to weaknesses or ambiguities in my earlier post--which
like this one, was written at too great a speed to fault me for using scare
quotes.  but i feel i should say something about the apg.  first, i do accept
the argument that the group includes a diversity of poets.  in fact,  i think
that some of them are doing work that interests *me* a lot whatever other
value it--or the work i don't so much like-- might or might not have.  my
references to the "apg" actually reflect my reluctance to criticize, by
name--or even, in any specific terms, the work of-- poets who are not in some
sense already "established."  even now i am very reluctant to criticize
presjnar's & lowther's work at length in this venue (though, if i thought
there was any interest i would do it, i suppose, in an essay--but would
anyone run it?).  but this has been, obviously, on my part, an unsatisfactory
inhibition as it seems to have spared nobody's feelings.

The Jargon Society is pleased to announce the publication of
AT DUSK IRIDESCENT
a substantial selection of Thomas Meyer's poems, 1972-1997

The jacket, using photographs by Mark Steinmetz and Guy Mendes, is stunning.
The book's design, by Jeff Clark, is wonderfully fresh and gives the poems
all the room they need.

AT DUSK IRIDESCENT is not "easy. " Thomas Meyer ranges across a panoply of
ancient & modern European and Asian lanaguages. The poems are serene,
meditative; at times erotic, at other times sombre. Hip-Hop Contemporary
Life is not like that. Few readers these days have much in the way of
gravitas, or a broad acquaintance with the world's poetic heritage. (The
Editor of Parnassus, our finest magazine devoted to reviewing poetry, has
tried for 28 years to find someone capable of taking on TM's previous books
and has come up short.) Reviews or not, this is an impressive volume and
there will be many enthusiasts for it. Ezra Pound (remember him?) used to
say he dividred poetry into what he could read and what he couldn't. I have
read AT DUSK IRIDESCENT calmly and carefully to the very last page.

THE ART OF CAPITALISM

I heard of this woman who loved to eat oranges. Hey, a friend
said to her, You should go see this movie at the International
Film Festival. It's just tjhis woman eating an orange for fifteen
minutes in close-up.

So go she did.

Two weeks later, he husband finally notices something's amiss
with her.  You've been pretty much depressed and off your feed,
he says.  Why not eat an orange?

I can eat an orange better than the woman in that movie, she
tells him.  I'm damned if I can see why I should have to eat
an orange and not get paid for it.

Dear Dale,



Joe Brennan kindly forwarded your post.  I had just been thinking earlier
that if I did the interview again I would say something about how the poet
isn't just a shaman, but a reporter, and sometimes a prophet.  I was
thinking about Anna Akhmatova's REQUIEM as a cardinal example from the last
century.



I also replied to Brian Stefans backchannel.  On those murky words (murky in
my usage) "materialism, rationalism": the interview with Kent helped me
clarify some very basic issues (as I see them).  Rationalism/materialism
means, at least to me, the main "zeitgeist" of the last few centuries: a
narrow, debased form of Reason, which questions but without insight, allied
to a realpolitik of self-interested power, and with a mirror-face of
fanaticism, "full of passionate intensity". But reasoning without evidence
is mere wind, empty talk.



The work of poetry and art is to supply evidence for a deeper, more

humane Reason: the evidence of beauty, harmony, bravery, mystery,

truth.  Of course, not everyone always everywhere (none of us) have

ears to hear this kind of evidence - but it's there just the same,

providing its strange "answers", lifting the human spirit.



It was unfair of me, & wildly inaccurate, to portray the elfin Charles

Bernstein as point-man for that zeitgeist. But I wanted to emphasize

aspects of poetry that seem to have been lost sight of, lately.

The occasion seemed apt.  I think we'll all figure it out at

the Sorbonne someday - and maybe even have a laugh.



Maybe they'll post this to the List if you send it - thanks - Henry

david bromidge, actually, yes!  it was warhol i had in the back of my
mind--so no oranges, & no punch line--but, essentially, yes.  hmm, i'd have
to work it out a little, but isn't there also something a little warholian
about tight corners & lines upon a distant prospect of lines? or --no--
something more like richard prince's joke paintings? so related in that way?
i think both are pretty great.

These statistics represent the current
subscribership to the Poetics List, as
given by country. The estimate will be
skewed to the U.S., thanks to our
chauvinistic software, which recognizes
country by the "country code" given at
the end of the domain segment of some
email addresses (e.g., ".ca" for Canada).
Since most U.S. addresses do not carry
the ".us" country code (i.e., since the
U.S. believes that it owns or perhaps
simply is the world) in the case
of addresses without a country code,
the program defaults to U.S.
     Special greetings to the Russian
members of our list, and any others
who are not accurately represented
in these statistics.

Each time I post the list statistics, I can't
help but wonder what's happening other locations
on that list. For instance, it's remarkable that
14 of us are in New Zealand, and yet I'd wager
that few of us outside of those 14 know much of
poetry in New Zealand.

I don't mean to put anyone on the spot, but
it would be good to hear from some of those
outside of the U.S. I'd be interested to know,
for example, whether there are active chapbook
presses in operation in any of these locations?
I've been told that small press is largely a
North American phenomenon - e.g., there are
very few chapbook presses in France (but see
Emmanuel Hocquard's "Un bureau sur l'Atlantique"
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/orgs/bureau/>) -
but it seems unlikely that there wouldn't be
some kind of inexpensive or informal publishing
going on almost everywhere. I'm also curious
what magazines and journals are in publication,
what sort of poetry is being written, what
sort of events are happening, etcetera.

... both the fragmentary and the self-reflexive are writ large all over
the modernist canon: Eliot, Williams, Pound of the Pisan Cantos,
Stevens. ... and if it is not always self-reflexive, the modernist
agenda is to purify the text of purely subjective clutter in the name of
a form and objectification of the self vis a vis the roll of the dice
(Mallarme)

... I have found the Lucious Jackson thread and how it touches on
questions of audience and program/intention and school/label -- all very
interesting. I think what Debrot was trying to say about the "social
sector" and how all poetries seems complacent might be part of the
collapse of high and low culture that I associate with pomo.

... it is also interesting that these generalities raise so many
attempts at clarification, authentication in protest to labeling. I
think this desire for authentication is all part of the modernist
heritage -- it is sort of like an examination of conscious to bring in
the Irish joke thread. Maybe a postmodern poetics would among other
things have to be a non-apologetics.

... even the langpo notion that the meanings underlying exposed
incoherencies are in the language .... seems a purifying modernist
gesture in hindsight.

... so we are back to an unapologetics of fragmentary sound clusters --
and maybe they articulate rushes and pauses that are related to sex or
dancing or aerobics or even sharing.

Yes, I agree with Mr.Moderator -- I would love to see more posts from the
people not in the USA about poetry activity in their local locales.  Am
also wondering why no Israeli listers, just personally, because Hebrew is
really the only language I can speak well enough to do decent translating,
and I've been trying for awhile now to find more experimental Israeli
poets.  If anyone knows of any, please backchannel.

Hassen --  it's lost its old freshness  so it doesnt feel like, & isnt, real
time anymore.  Now that every posting is moderated, it is impossible to fire
back a reply & see it posted on the list in almost immedaitely   in _real
time_  Maybe that's why there's not much call on the _other signs_ that
accompany words.

It feels to me like a severe limitation on discussion of poetics to so
disassociate it from the terms of live communication.  It wdnt be difficult
to create a msn. poetics chatroom -- with password & host/hostess who cd
simply remove people who were being seriously obnoxious & obstructive. It
would make it difficult to compose anything much more than one or two liners

& it could be as tedious as those dreary moments when chatters simply say hi

i've also wondered why the only language written here is English and why
most topics (class, local, why doesn't poetry sell more, etc.) take a
somewhat parochial view.

i want it understood that this post, linking me with the likes of Bromering
and Bowidger has significantly imperiled my opportunity for a job as chief
Disciplinarienne in the new age chemistry program at Moosehead Community
College.  i believe i was on the short short list, but now i've been
relegated to the long short list and perhaps even to the long long list.
there are times, i assure you, when length is not the virtue it is assumed
to be, though Messrs B&B would not appear to know this.  those antlers, for
instance ... topheavy!

Yes, there is definitely an empathic thread.  Although I'm not too sure that
face-to-face detoxifies paranoia, as words--written or spoken--have a
tendency to effuse a paralinguistic taint.
Just that the internet arrived mysteriously on the cusp of a new century,
and what this means when it comes to space/time and the possibility of new
strategies of collaboration is yet to be worked out.

What on earth is going on?
There's neither proportion nor perspective in these posts.
As an Irishman I'm far more offended by the spectacle of David Bromige
practically being accused of racism than at the original joke itself. That
an accusation so grave, and so misplaced, is supported by so little is
hardly any less offensive to me.
 On a milder not, I'm amazed that the possibility of more than one reading
is
being so strenuously rejected, here of all places.

Stupid doesn't worry me. But I would be concerned if the Irish started
turning into humourless shirts stuffed with standard-issue pea-brained p.c.
twaddle.

MAD Cartoonist Don Martin Dies

     MIAMI (AP) _ Don Martin, longtime Mad magazine cartoonist who
drew an assortment of wild-haired characters, punctuating the
grotesque action with wacky words like SPLOP! and POIT!!, has died.
He was 68.
    Martin died of cancer at Baptist Hospital, hospital spokeswoman
Christine Thompson said today.
    During his 30-odd years as a Mad contributor, Martin based his
humor on misery and misfortune, to crack ``sick'' jokes. The
magazine dubbed him ``Mad's Maddest Cartoonist.''
    The guy poisoning pigeons in the park _ ``I hate pigeons'' _
winds up killing the people who gather around to sample his
scrumptious popcorn. Mona Lisa, as the reader realizes only in the
last frame of the strip, is sitting on a toilet. Hapless boobs with
big feet get squashed in all manner of ways.
    ``There's always been physical suffering in comedy,'' he once
said. ``Even ancient clowns kicked each other in the seat of the
pants or hit each other over the head. It's the same thing in our
time, just a little stronger.''
    The cartoons had a vocabulary all their own. ``SHKLIP'' was the
sound made when construction workers tossed concrete at each other.
``SPLOP'' described a surgeon throwing body parts into a doggie
bag. ``FAGROON'' came from a collapsing skyscraper.
    His license plate read ``SHTOINK.''
    ``Is it funny? That's the only test I know when it comes to
cartooning,'' Martin once said. ``Not whether it's sick, or whether
it's going to ruin people's values or morals. You only have to ask
a simple question: Is it funny?''
    His twisted approach influenced generations of younger
cartoonists.
    ``Don Martin was the one who really stood out,'' Gary ``The Far
Side'' Larson told The Miami Herald in a story published in 1990.
``I really always loved his work. He was such a great artist.''
    Martin left Mad magazine in 1987 after a falling-out with its
publisher, the late William Gaines, accepting a job at Cracked, a
competitor.
    Martin chafed at the tradition that Mad, like most publishers,
retained all rights to reprint and profit from his work that it
used, paying him on a free-lance basis. But he put out paperbacks
of cartoons not published in the magazine, eventually selling more
than 7 million copies.
    Martin drew despite a degenerative eye condition that forced him
to undergo cornea transplants, wear special, highly uncomfortable
contact lenses and use a magnifying glass while drawing.
    ``He was a shy and retiring sort of guy, considering he drew a
comic strip that was crazy,'' said a longtime friend, Laurence
Donovan.
    Martin was born in Clifton, N.J., and began his undergraduate
work at the Newark Institute. He earned a fine arts degree from the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He began submitting drawings to
the fledgling Mad magazine in the mid-50s.

Hi Patrick,

I'd like to respond to some of comments to David about his joke, =
particularly this line:

> How can one be completely ignorant of sentiments like the Irish as =
"niggers
turned inside out" just as blacks were called "smoked Irish"? =20

As I've probably mentioned before, I was born and raised in Rutherford, =
NJ, with obviously very Asiatic features imprinted on my face (I give my =
mother credit for that, she was very clever).  The suburb, by the time I =
got there (and much in contrast to Williams's Stecher trilogy) was =
primarily Irish, Italian and Polish -- mostly Roman Catholic as far as I =
could tell -- and with my wide, "ignorant" eyes it seemed to me the =
world was pretty much controlled by these folks, which is pretty much =
another way of saying that I stuck out a bit, but certainly didn't up =
until quite late in my life (say, after college) have any way of =
appreciating the fact of this accident, and that this apparent totality =
was something of a fiction -- as you most clearly point out with your =
historical data and the variety of terms that you used.  Which is to =
say, bluntly, that I was quite ignorant of these statements, and many =
others, much to same degree that I was ignorant of the fact that much of =
the hostility I felt directed toward me when I was a kid -- from adults =
and people of my age (i.e. from people who "should have known better") =
was probably a result of lingering sentiments of anger against the =
government during the Vietnam War, and partially from that of the Korean =
War (of course, I thought it was about me, since I thougth the Koreans =
lost the Korean war, not the Americans).  I was always very amazed and =
impressed when I met a non-Asian, or a "white" person from such a =
background (meaning, I suppose, a class background, since most of these =
people I am referring to were [as far as I know, this is provisional] =
moving up from a working class background to middle class, which is to =
say from Jersey City to Rutherford) who expressed any sort of affection =
toward Koreans or Korea itself (whose history is one of the sadder ones =
in our century, I feel, with my bias, certainly during the first half =
and well into the present, where the situation in North Korea is =
something of a joke to those who aren't particularly concerned with the =
division -- even my father thinks the division of the country is =
permanent.).  Again, I met people who changed my sense of this totality, =
but as far as I was concerned, the Irish, Italians, etc. -- perhaps due =
to their projections of their assurance that they were more American =
than myself, or were Americans at all whereas I was not -- were the =
elite, the thing to be.  Certainly, as most of the young lady-folk were =
of this elite, I felt, in my adolescent sensibility, it would have been =
a nice thing.

I think, consequently (beyond my concern with your rhetorical tactic, =
which really doesn't leave much option for David to do anything, =
really), that you contradict yourself by stating certain things as very =
"obvious" and then proceed to provide which, to most people I think, =
would be fairly esoteric detail, not to mention relationships that are =
untenable.  Which is to say that the background you provide doesn't go =
to prove that David was ignorant of something obvious, but that he is =
not a scholar (of sorts) in the subject.  Consequently, everybody knows =
that the race issue concerning African Americans is far more public (I'm =
not concerned with which is more serious or not, this is not the point) =
than those of Irish Americans.  What you choose to do about that is up =
to you.  But in the public sphere, or public media, the situtation of =
African Americans has punctuated our understanding of American history =
in a very general way, from the civils rights movement to the L.A. =
"uprising" or "riots" (or whatever you want to call it).  There are far =
fewer punctuation marks for homosexual rights in the country, for =
example, and those that exist haven't had the same degree of projection =
than that of African Americans -- Stonewall, for example, was not =
something I knew about until I was in college (that's what you get for =
having a Korean as a mother), and there hasn't been a follow-up to this. =
 Can we state with certainty that there is a general understanding of =
the Cuban situation among Americans, or does it change to an incredible =
degree depending on what state you happen to live in?  I had friends in =
college who didn't even know Koreans were any factor in the L.A. =
incident -- they just read it as a bunch of African Americans expressing =
rage against the white system, and of course sympathized inadvertently =
assigned what could be called a permanent position to African Americans =
in the states, or at least a political force: to be be perrennially =
dissatisfied, to more or less always exist in the (to use Hegelian =
terms, not historically encoded though perhaps inflected) slave-master =
relationship. In other words, African American identity is essentialized =
by this relationship, hence foreclosing any sort of real imagination for =
change.  More to the point, the complexity of race relations in America =
is completely lost with this ignorance, not to mention the continuing =
invisibility of Korean American's particularly complex position right =
now -- the country (South Korea) is doing well economically, but =
politically lacks any real clout, and the country and culture as a =
whole, which the Japanese quite literally tried to wipe out for 35 some =
odd years, is still split.  I didn't eevn know that I "wasn't supposed =
to like the Japanese" until I was much older -- in Rutherford, we were =
all pretty much in the same spot, they were Vietnamese and Chinese just =
like me.)  Every Korean American in this country carries something of =
this in them (my mother, who is young as mothers go, I think, her =
mid-fifties, was six when she had to cross the country by foot and on =
the backs of trains to reach Seoul).  I consider it a very good, =
strange, statistically improbable day when I meet someone who has a clue =
about any of this (hence my affection to Bruce Andrews, who devoted his =
political science career, back when it existed, to this very issue). To =
most others, Koreans are good in math.

So to return to your post:

> I was born and raised in america and was acutely aware of this =
stereotype of
the Irish, as many well-educated people are.

The key term is "acute" -- I am obviously acutely of many things, as the =
post above states -- but the percentage of "well-educated" folk who are =
similarly "acutely" aware, or even, I would add, indifferently aware, is =
probably very low, not to mention that I don't see what role being =
"well-educated" plays -- Noam Chomsky, for instance, probably (based on =
his movie) got more of his political, and very acute, awareness of these =
issues from listening to his relatives talk politics than from the =
schools.

Anyway, this is a ramble (my computer is hiccuping, must be the gods =
telling me something's wrong).

Yours,
Brian

There was something else I wanted to mention (besides the fact that the =
joke, not unlike "Starship Troopers", can be read in totally different =
ways, and that in both contexts it can be extreme -- an extremely =
tasteless joke based on racial stereotypes, and an extremely =
metaphysical joke based on absurd degrees of reasoning which is, at the =
same time, a testament to that reasoning), which is the following =
passage from Pound's essay on Williams:

"There is an anecdote told me by his moher, who wished me to understand =
his character, as follows: The young William Carlos, aged let us say =
about seven, arose in the morning, dressed ond put on his shoes.  Both =
shoes buttoned on the left side.  He regarded this untoward phenomenon =
for a few moments and then carefully removed the shoes, placed shoe _a_ =
that had been on his left foot, on his right foot, and shoe _b_, that =
had been on the right foot, on his left foot; both sets of the buttons =
again appeared on the left side of the shoes.

"This stumped him.  With the shoes so buttoned he went to school, but... =
and here is the significant part of the story, he spent the day in =
careful consideration of the matter."  ("Dr. Williams' Position")

Pound wasn't saying that he was stupid, I don't think, but I'm not =
prepared right now to interpret this or go on about it.

I am also reminded of the early part of Ulysses, in which Stephen =
Daedelus is turning over the phrase:

"And no more turn aside and brood
Upon love's bitter mystery
For Fergus rules the brazen cars."

I didn't understand, when first reading this book, what was so important =
about the line "love's bitter mystery," but this, along with many other =
phrases in Joyce, takes on talismanic properties as it is repeated =
througout the novel.  I guess I mention this since I think it is not a =
too willed reading of the joke to see that there is a metaphysical joke =
underlying it, and that there is a special flavor of this in the Irish =
tradition (at least to those like me who are not Irish) that probably =
has to do with this very position of the Irish scholars and bards as the =
preservers of European culture, but with the hermetic inflection that =
could be attributed, I don't know, to many things -- I'm not a scholar.

I would ask, though, and with no answers myself: do we call Heidegger =
"stupid" for asking "Why is there essents, or things, rather than =
nothing"?  How stupid was Kierkegaard to the Corsaire?  Could this joke =
of David's have a different reading for those of us who think "untimely" =
-- in the way Heidegger thinks philosophy is always "untimely," which =
isn't to say useless -- and for those who think materially?  Can a joke =
have an essence? I know that within the system of contingent values this =
joke falls pretty heavily on the one side, but in another system it =
falls pretty far to the other, and whether we use an "Irishman" or not =
does and does not matter -- it could be a rune disguised as a joke.

Anyway, cheers.

I think that the joke--if taken at its surface level, as being about
stupidity--would have been in bad taste at those times. I had heard that
the situation of the Irish improved immeasurably in the last 70 years.

+ + + + + + +

One further point : I have never heard a joke about any stereotype which I
could take personally, even where said stereotype supposedly applies to a
group to which I belong. It was different, of course, to be physically
attacked for being English, or better-educated, or smaller and weaker, or
against the war in Vietnam, or (their mistake, but it made me proud)
Jewish.

 But words, when in the context of a joke, slid right off me. Were I Irish,
I should not suppose myself to be the stupid stereotype with which some
find this joke ends. Perhaps this is because, as Patrick says in another
recent post, love is beyond the behavioristic pattern,-- and, corollary, if
one loves oneself, these stereotypes need not apply. Don't we find them
amusing (though, obviously, not all of the people all of the time!) for
what they show us about the mechanical process of undifferentiated
thinking, on the part of the teller (although s/he may be disingenuous) and
his audience, as well as the putative butt?

For me, at the risk of flogging a dead horse (which I already enlisted
Mother Murphy's help in burying, I had hoped), the surprise matching-up of
full glass with thirst, empty glass with no-thirst, suggests that "Paddy
isnt so simple," and becomes a critique of an unquestioning acceptance of
the joke on its surface level.  (Mary Murphy in the dream showed me the
easy way out, and why not take it? Alas, Patrick's post and mine passed in
the night, and so there is further work to do).

I suppose what makes me persist in what Patrick Herron takes for folly is a
something more I find in this joke. He calls my persistence pride (with
which, I assume, he has no quarrel, since pride is surely involved in Billy
Mills' objection), and it may be, but I think it is also a pedagogue's
belief that the student--however well-educated--hasn't heard all there is
to be heard in a piece of language.

+ + + + + +

It is interesting, isn't it? that those who reprehend me for defending a
joke that they find hurtful, if only at a remove, would be more wounding of
my feelings, than the joke, not being personal, could ever be of theirs. As
though there were an anger already waiting in them, for something to slip
its leash. Imagine telling a stranger what his only options are! That I
might have done that, ever, makes me blush for shame.


David

sorry ted the last post/quote was for peter.
i believe peter is still thinking of the computer as a tool rather than a
medium for creation, for the virtualization of the yet to be conceived,
rather than the actualization of the already possible.

he also has a very limited view of hypertext fictions and seems to see
hypertext as a new way of indexing texts, which it is not.
look at mark amerika's http://www.holo-x.com  on-line hypermedia fiction,
or the brandon project at the guggenheim museum or the lesko's codex
to see examples of hypertext which is not just re-indexing for a new medium.

and patrick, i hope you have forgiven me, but there seems to have been much
good coming out of my suspicious questioning of your intent, as evidenced
by the great discussions we are having now on this list. you are looking
for real computer art, then i suggest you study the work of reiner
strasser, he is unique in the field i believe. i must admit most of my work
is imitation of styles, but reiner's work has developed a unique
cyberpoetry voice, a voice like a voice in traditional poetry, that others
like me, try to emulate.
his work for me is a new experience, a poetic, text based experience,
coupled with the excitement of discovery that games and quizzes give us, as
well as being aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and charged with aural
signs. i find his work a poetry of the senses.
recently patrick you mentioned eduardo kac, and since we have been talking
about the terms that describe the field we are working in, it might be
interesting to note that when i made my first digital animated text poetry
on computer in 1994, i called it cyberpoetry, but i did not surf the
internet 'till april 1996, when i came across eduardo's holopoetry. i wrote
to him inviting him to visit my site and what he thought of the name
dimocopo(digital moving concrete poetry) as a name for what i was doing,
which i had previously called cyberpoetry but thought it was too generic.
eduardo wrote back saying that calling it dimocopo associated it with
concrete poetry movement which was a thing of the past, and that what i was
doing was in fact new and different. if i called it dimocopo it would just
be seen as an extension of what already existed.
later when i started to add sound, the term grew to dimocoposo which became
hideous, so i reverted to calling it cyberpoetry.
i now make the distinction, for myself, not as a rule, but so i can
understand where and what i am doing, i make the distinction that digital
art/poetry is created on the computer using software and cyberpoetry is
when that digitally produced work specifically with the interconnectivity
and interactivity of the world wide web in mind, poetry which is created
for cyberspace, for all the senses.
the thing about reiner's work is that the content and form work so well
together that it pulls me through the work two or three times before i dive
into his source code to see how he did that.
on the other hand the recent work of jim rosenberg on this list only holds
an interest in the technology for me, the content actually not
engaging me as much as how the elements(blocks of text) interact as objects.
at the risk of being cliche, the technology in good webart net-art
cyberpoetry, has to be transparent.

another thing about programmability, consider this.
a computer program is a controlled system, all the variables are fully
defined, in life, in poetry, the variables are not defined and can never be
defined fully. in a sense a computer program is the only real thing that
exits, it is totally constructed to act in totally predictable ways.
however when programs are put onto the web and we interact with them we
bring that unpredictability to them.
look at plumb design's visual thesaurus http://www.thinkmap.com, this is
just a program for displaying a database of words, a thesaurus, but because
the user can input words, or it can randomly navigate a journey through the
thesaurus, the journey becomes poetic, words associating meanings by the
order in which they appear, in the clashing combinations of cyberspace.
this poetic experience is always different, is always unrecordable,
non-reproducible of the moment.
as with many other poetry machines, that seem to have no other author than
the present user.

i forget who said something about the words of a poem on the web and the
whole thing the piece is saying, (i think it was talan or jennifer, sorry.)
and i agree wholeheartedly.

julia kristeva, 'revolution in poetic language', makes the distinction
between the phenotext and the genotext, the former being the words on the
paper, and the later, the words on paper plus the context in which it is
read, and added to the phenotext, by the reader.
barthes also in 'from work to text' makes the distinction between 'the
work', the words on paper/spoken, and 'the text', which is the words on
paper plus everything that is brought to those words by all who read it,
and everything else it comes packaged with.
i think that is what charles olson was on about as well, that the written
language is a poor substitute for what we actually want to say.

being involved in cyberspace has changed the way i read published poetry
these days. i tend to look for the 'space' the poem has or is capable of
inducing around the words on paper, and find that a lot of published poetry
is tied to a physical landscape, it maps out a very definite journey, but a
flat journey, even if the poem is mapping cultural, relationship or
psychological landscapes.
whereas cyberpoetry is always spatial for me, and thus doesn't allow for
topographical flat poetry, i am also realizing that women poets of the page
and stage and now the world wide web have always been more successful at
creating 'spatial' poetry than men, perhaps because in patriarchal society
they have always been relegated to those "other" spaces or places that men
didn't think important.
perhaps that is why women in general are so prominent in the development
and thinking about cyberspace, brenda laurel leads the field in interface
design thinking, sadie plant in cultural and feminist representation of
cyberspace, janet murray in the development of narrative in cyberspace,
roseanne stone on gender representations and issues of identity, the
hypertext community of trAce in the u.k.. generally george landow is
considered the guru of hypertext but he really has only actualized what was
known to be possible(vannevar bush, roland bathes, ted nelson, marshall
mcluhan and post modern and post structuralist theory postulating the
possibility of hypertext. it seems to be women and men who are prepared not
to think in a male way who are virtualizing cyberspace and text.

while i'm on my high horse(and many people think this is where i am most of
the time) i'm really pissed off that at the moment on another list, the
poetry list of the epc,buffalo, the big topic of discussion is about the
divisions between poets in the language group and the workshop group,(and
other smaller u.s.a. groups of poets)when in fact little separates them in
politics or poetry and they argue about minor advances in the poetics of
each group complaining that poetry is in crisis and nothing new is
happening. i remind you this happens as an email discussion on the internet
and yet no one mentions what is happening to poetry on the web.

any way just a few thoughts, thanks for the great posts.

If you haven't gotten your hands on Bob Archambeau's _SAMIZDAT_, I highly
recommend doing so.  During this past year, it has been a most welcomed
arrival on my front steps.  It has, indeed, accomplished what it has set
out to do, publish poetry that is outside language and workshop poetries.
It's excellent, and Bob has pulled it of with such irony.

For instance, Samizdat is published on news paper, in a tabloid size, with
the red ink of tabloid banners and headlines.  Excellent!  I love the
quality of the tabloid.  And in the modernist vein (or in the inheritance
of the modernist vein) that Bob professes in his editorials, it is indeed
"All the news that stays news."  Oh what the heck as EP said,
"Irrepressibly fresh..."

---the local:  what's at stake here, exactly?... is it that the "local" is
no longer useful (to poets?  to writers?  to artists?  to voters?) as a
pragmatic construction?... by "pragmatic" i mean in terms both of
aesthetics and community... by "community" i'm not sure what i mean... but
if so, is this b/c the digital (western? emerging pacific rim? desktop?)
world has managed to subordinate it? (via simulation marketing etc.)... you
can air-drop me to parts of my hometown (syracuse ny) and i can tell you in
an instant where i am... which ability? landscape? symbiosis? mythology?
phenotypical up-shot? i value highly, for so many reasons... other parts of
my hometown resemble, to some terrifying detail, patches of the suburban
sprawl here, between denver and boulder...

or is the problem that "the local" signals more a matter of conceptual
nuance these days?... has a, the, any metaphysics of place been so
thoroughly deconstructed (or whatever) that there is in effect no place
left to stand?...

i find the latter a bit scary, actually, when i think about what sorts of
political exigencies might be req'd to stop , e.g., construction of a
nuclear incinerator fifteen miles upwind of the tetons... as i just this
morning heard on npr---and if you heard the same thing, our locals are thus
brought into proximity... which isn't to suggest there are no local
differences at work here, among us... e.g., i'm finding the writing
communities here in the boulder area FAR more integrated than what i
experienced in chicagoland (and of course, yes, "my experience" is also
part of the brew)...

i'm a bit dumbstruck here, in all, at what i take to be the tacit levels of
analysis and emphases at work in the various musings i've read thus far re
"the local"... i can recall having argued with a self-professed marxist
scholar once as to whether there was any substantive material difference
between two ostensibly different chairs (one metal, one wood)... his reply
was that not only was there no substantive material difference between said
chairs, but that there was no substantive material difference twixt the
preformed concrete wall before which we both stood, and either chair...
very well then... i understand the conceptual move here (i
think---something approaching a critique of postmodern architecture), and i
can even grasp the intellectual politics (if you will) of said move... but
it doesn't do a helluvalot for my understanding of the micro-movements
(materials, workers, even quality issues) supporting such material items...
another way of saying which would be, my father (a wood-worker who never
earned more than ten bucks an hour) would have had a shit-fit at this
latter collapse of distinctions...

---publishing as a writer's (and not simply poet's) concern... something
about the discussion of high/low culture (another collapse, salutary in so
many ways), mainstream vs. avant-garde (or whatever), oppositional vs.
aligned (or whatever), that seems to me to be neglecting a discussion of
what's been going down in the publishing world, and how it's changed lo
these last three decades... i wonder how public we might be here w/o
falling into the standard writer's gripe?... i have, let's see now,
something like 28 rejections from publishers (university presses, trades,
smaller presses) for a (dare i say?) *memoir* that i finished some eighteen
months ago (many glowing rejections, i might add, for a relatively
conventional piece of prose, re which i am being given to understand, in
general, that it's just not marketable enough)... ditto for my wife and
partner (in her case, a novel and a memoir)... one thing i'll risk
postulating outright:  these 28 rejections equal perhaps twice that number
if viewed against the publishing world of 1975 (owing to the incredible
number of mergers and the like since)... never mind poetry for a moment

(re which i've NEVER been able to figure precisely how publishing a book of
same actually works (chapbooks? huh?), *except* inasmuch as one becomes a
'known' quantity via whatever networks (virtual, fleshy) one is interested
in plumbing... always feels, much as with the trades, a kind of
who-you-know game to me... and i don't know that this is necessarily a BAD
thing, provided everyone agrees it's who-you-know... re literary
scholarship, on the other hand, publishing strikes me as much more
straightforward)...

like i say, never mind poetry for a moment... also on hand here, rejections
from literary agents... one (re kass's novel, which dabbles in assemblage,
but focuses on life in central pa), very forthcoming, and suggestive, to
wit:  'if you were from eastern europe, no doubt i could find a publisher
for this item'... as i say, *very* suggestive...

what's going on right now, publishing wise?... i don't believe poetry is a
world unto itself here, either... though of course poetry is typically
associated with zero profit margins... but the situation is more
complicated than might be implied by setting poetic production/distribution
over in its own corner, or esp., "above" more lucrative forms...

----sometimes it's best, initially anyway, to define things in terms of
what they DON'T do... i.e., not what is language poetry, but what ISN'T?...
my first answer to "what is a poem?" is "anything you want a poem to be"...
which at least opens to the question of how we come to poetry, how it comes
to us---which requires an examination of assumptions, and corresponding
speculation, which opens to notions of genre, readership, etc... in any
case, i found dale smith's post provocative (dale raises one of my favorite
issues, justice), and i thought (whether i agreed with him or not) that he
was on the right track... "this is what language poetry doesn't do"...

now, as to my not agreeing with dale:  one problem here is the obvious
critical-poetic nexus that seems to have accompanied language
poetry-writing since its inception... take charles bernstein's _my way_---a
compendium, and in some ways a summation, of charles's project... now, in
one sense it's not too difficult to distinguish twixt the more poetic (term
used advisedly) and less poetic of the pieces in that volume... though most
(of us too) will likely employ relatively well-worn categories (written in
lines vs. written in sentences) to designate the poems in said volume
"poems," and the prose, "prose" (back cover indicates "speeches and poems,
interviews and essays")... but if, IF one were to seek out charles's oeuvre
in terms not of such clearcut (as in *absolute*, *intrinsic*) distinctions
twixt the prose and the poetry, but in terms of his writing in general:
then i think it fair to observe that charles's writing is infused
throughout with considerations of social (and institutional) justice... and
not simply from the point of view of turning capitalist realities
inside-out (if you will)... i think i could prove this readily, by citing
any number of excerpts... but see for yourselves...

well, permit me *one* polemical citation anyway:  "we must resist the idea
that difficult art is elitist, any more than that science is elitist or
learning is elitist. such arguments breed demagoguery not populist
empowerment.  by denying the value of the labor necessary to become
linguistically and culturally informed, we encourage the maintenance of an
uninformed, indeed, ignorant, citizenry" (311)... he talks of citizenry, by
gosh... by contrast (and similarly), have a look at a presumed 'poem' from
said volume, "dear mr. fanelli," which is nothing if not a direct verbal
assault on our bureaucrazies, and their casual disregard for public (and
private) welfare... nothing at all, in fact, "inaccessible" about this
latter (quotes merely to indicate another vexed notion)...

----to kent j:  i hear what you're saying, kent... but when you ask,
rhetorically,

        But isn't it high time to say clearly (without it meaning
        that anyone "lost" or whatever) that the "mistake" that was made
        constituted a serious, regretable wrong?

i'm wincing... i used the word "mistake" in my post knowing full-well that
the only "mistake" some would likely construe would be the "mistake" made
by joel and charles... here's another rhetorical question, to match yours:

        isn't it high time to say clearly (without it meaning that anyone
"lost" or
        whatever) that "mistakes" were made on all sides?...

now what to *do*, what should be done, once this latter is "said," is
anyone's guess... i won't presume to speak for henry here either, or for
that matter, for chris a...

----finally:  someone said something or other i think (sorry, can't recall
who) about facial expressions... so why is it that i often picture so many
of you with crinkled brow and, uh, serious demeanor?...

please, i'm chuckling right now, really, and one eye is just about to
wink... i wouldn't be doing this if it weren't, yknow, FUN...

best,

joe

 sense already "established."  even now i am very reluctant to criticize
 presjnar's & lowther's work at length in this venue (though, if i thought
 there was any interest i would do it, i suppose, in an essay--but would
 anyone run it?).  but this has been, obviously, on my part, an unsatisfactory
 inhibition as it seems to have spared nobody's feelings. >>

jaques, i find these comments interesting and engaging.  you point out that
as individual poets, none of us are really "established."  (depending on what
is meant by that word, its possible that some agp folk wouldn't want to be
established - but that's another topic).  and this apparently has kept you
from making specific criticism of our work.  specifically you mention
prejsnar and lowther.  i haven't discussed this with them but my experience
has been that they welcome specific critique of their poetry and the ideas
believed to be behind them.  re mark you say: <<presjnar's too simple
understanding of lang poetry & his very easy  & uncomplicated adoption of
oppositional terms & the way in which this is manifested in his poems-- that
i object to>>  i would like to hear why you think mark has a too simple
understanding of language poetry and also how you see this as manifested in
his poems.   and i'd be interested not only because i know mark's work, but
because i think he is one of the many 'unlabeled' post-langpo poets out there
that is worth discussing.  why wait until someone is established?  who is
established since langpo/new york school anyway?

several things indicate you have an interest in our work:  the fact that you
have read and commented on the agp issue of mirage#4/period(ical).  that you
continue to use apg as an example as you discuss poetics on this list.  and
also i know you have given my work serious consideration for your magazine.
so if you are interested why do you think others would not be?  i think
others would be interested not because the apg is so special but because i
think people are interested in specific critique of other people's
poems/essays because it might then give them a different perspective in their
own work.  this gets back perhaps to your comment that poetry is in need of
an 'outside'.  (i think you said something like that).  my outside recently
has been british/irish poetry.  chris alexander is asking about the poetry
scene in new zealand.  (i have a feeling i'm simplimentizing and mangling
your idea of 'outside')

if i hear your overall message correctly you are trying to understand and
theorize what has gone on in contemporary poetry since langpo.  not only that
but it seems you are trying to suggest some ideas to this community (poetics
list, contemp po) about how to keep poetry and poetics alive and thriving.
several have commented that your posts along with stefans and others have
been a sort of shot in the arm to this list.  i agree.   my guess is that the
majority of people on this list consider themselves unestablished,
unaffiliated with a school or movement.  (would love to hear otherwise if i'm
off base).  we are the great miscellany school.  so anyway i hope your
comments continue and i hope they become even more specific because it seems
you want to make meaningful comments re the poetic landscape since langpo but
because you are hesitant to make specific criticisms you end up using a broad
brush and as you noted such a hesitancy is << an unsatisfactory inhibition as
it seems to have spared nobody's feelings >>  one such broad stroke is the
way that you use language poetry.  when you use those words who/what are you
talking about? language poetry involved many poets over several years so
which aspect of language poetry or which language poet's poetics are you
honing in on?  in order to make speific comments re someone's work in
comparison to langpo it seems you would first have to define langpo or
describe which part of it you are referring to.  if you don't do this then
the term langpo just becomes a blunt instrument/weapon.
re mark you mention his "very easy and uncomplicated adoption of oppositional
terms." what part of langpo do you see as using "oppositional terms."  i say
this not in disagreement, but in hopes of continuing the conversation.

mounting my soapbox - ie, not necessarily addressing or critiquing jacques
here -
let me say it this way: i think this list and our community of poets would
benefit from more discussion of specific poets and their works.  i like
conversations that go something like:  "you know i find this line in this
poem really interesting because it responds to what __________ (surrealist,
black mountain, pound, new formalist, langpo, buckminster fuller, braque,
etc) was trying to get at, ie _________ .  and i never thougth of it that way
before.  but then later these three lines seem to undercut what's been
accomplished because formally it______________ which seems to suggest a
politics of__________ and that turns me off because i think poetry is better
served when its political (not political) in this way of__________.  so
that's how it strikes me, tell me what you were going for in this piece"
again, if there are others on this list who are not interested in this kind
of discussion, let me hear about it.  but to me this shows INTEREST.  even
when or especially when the criticism is in disagreement.  i think most of us
want our poems to be in circulation, to be discussed.  that's what makes a
community.  otherwise our work becomes dust-gathering ornamentation.
but i must be idealistically off base somewhere here (its happened before)
because i've been on this list for two (or three?) years now and such
conversations rarely happen.

Maybe, as a one time only experiment (since it would take a long time to =

country codes on them but who are, in fact, mostly writing from non-US =
locales could chime in, perhaps to a special email address, with their =

of course, but I get a little frustrated seeing numbers like "683" in =
the US row of the stats and 1s next to other countries and hypothetical =
0s next to those that don't make the list.  Let's carve up that 683.  I =
tend to assume that most people on the list are from the States -- it's =
why "non-intellectual" statements like "I read this while nearly running =
over a [insert name of geographically specific animal here] this =
morning" are sometimes useful.  I think the Australians should attack =
(or "Attahk", which is the name of a Magma album, I think), not to be =

I like Brian's suggestion very much, but with the reservation
that I can't handle even such a small influx of mail right now,
let alone attempt to organize the data in question. If someone
would like to volunteer to undertake the task, I'm sure it
would be appreciated.

from MEMORY CARDS

Yank my chain.  Pallid the leash-men.  Spasm in the back spells nine,
number so fine.

Show me writing that is not narcissistic, that doesn't come from the
hysterical female, the

drunken male (elephant tusks and so on).  She wants to call her thesis "the
oppressed

chick codes"; wonders if to feel guilty for laughing.  The memoir as a form
is like cinder,

grows around an invisible yet empty center, caldera lacking heat.  The
horses are a

magnificent line, my high school teacher said.  And that aside from
suicide, which the

governor claims is "a selfish act."  Who knows nothing, one imagines, of
interminable

pavement, the mind without prescription (New Zealanders "prescribe" books).
We can't

leave you here alone, my mother said.  The man with an orange VW bus jumped
from the

ninth floor across the street from me in Makiki, and his body lay on the
lot for hours.  A

white cloth covered him; there was blood on it.  The man who helped in the
yard

wondered why I took it so hard.  His father killed himself.


Ross Gay lives in Philadelphia, has recently had some poems in APR, Sulfur,
Columbia, does not have a car, can run pretty fast,and wants to dedicate
this reading
to Walt.

One Eye Gone Black

You knew the cancer would grow
over both lungs, make them
black, mossy shadows. But no one
told you about the blindness, that
before your breathing sounded
curdled and raw, one eye
would phase out, the morbid
meandering, a slow go, making
your chest ache like a tractor
breaking through bone.
The last time I visited you in Youngstown,
110 lbs, one eye's sight gone black
and the keloid on your arm approaching
the bicep in size, you gave the same
mechanic's vice-grip handshake, a challenge
and warning that your killing
would not be easy.

PRESS RELEASE
January 6, 2000
For immediate release (please forward to interested parties)

Gay Philadelphia Writer Kelly McQuain's Story Censored by Batman Owners


Riddle me this:  What's the one thing the superhero Batman won't protect?
Free
speech.  At least that's how Philadelphia writer Kelly McQuain sees it.  =
His
short story parody of the dynamic duo, "Je T'aime, Batman, Je T'adore,"
published in Simon & Schuster's anthology  Best American Erotica 1999, has
been
excised from a second printing of that volume due to threatened legal
action by
the owners of the popular Batman character (DC Comics, the long-time
publisher
of  Batman, is owned by media conglomerate Time Warner).

"Joker, Penguin and Catwoman and now me," laughs McQuain.  "I've joined
Batman's rogue's gallery as Bat-enemy Number One." McQuain, who has been
publishing short fiction since 1991, has had stories appear in The James
White
Review, The Harrington Gay Men's Fiction Quarterly, The Philadelphia
Inquirer
and elsewhere, and is the only writer to twice win the  Philadelphia City
Paper's annual Writing Award.  The work responsible for the current
controversy
was first published in the anthology Best Gay Erotica 1997.  At the time, =
it
received favorable reviews in Publishers Weekly and the Philadelphia City
Paper, which called the piece "an hilarious short story=D6 in which a =
hunky
young
Robin struggles with the Batlove that dares not speak its name."

McQuain only recently became aware that his work was now being censored.
"Shortly before New Year's, I was contacted by Susie Bright, the editor of
the
Best American Erotica series.  The good news?  The '99 edition had sold =
out
and
was going into a second printing.  The bad news?  My story was pulled.
Batman's lawyers had contacted the publisher of the anthology, Simon &
Schuster, and had threatened legal action.  I was told that Simon & =
Schuster
didn't care to fight the matter, and there was nothing I could do."

Pulling a story from a strong-selling collection is a rarity in the
publishing
world.  "On the bright side," notes McQuain, "anybody who has the first
edition
of Best American Erotica 1999 now has a collector's item.  But on a more
serious note, I believe my reference to the Batman character falls within
the
acceptable boundaries of parody usage.  Certainly there are other such
stories
out there.  A. M Homes wrote a wonderful sexual parody of Barbie in her
collection The Safety of Objects, and back in the '60s the late Donald
Barthelme published in his debut collection Come Back, Dr. Caligari a
parody of
Batman to which my own story is greatly indebted.  That story never caused
any
stir as far as I know."

McQuain, a native of Elkins, West Virginia, moved to Philadelphia several
years
ago to study at Temple University, from which he earned a Master's degree =
in
Creative Writing. For a short time in the mid-90s he worked as a comic =
book
artist for Comico, a Chicago-based comics company.  McQuain figures that a
July
1999 New York Times article about his short story and the popularity of
erotica
anthologies ("Batman's Robin Shaves His Legs? Erotica as a Portrait of the
Age") is what prompted Batman's handlers to cry foul.  "The lawyers'
concern is
a testament to the story's success," concludes McQuain, who has read =
plenty
of
lesser parodies of trademarked characters published on the Internet.  "The
fact
that my story has been widely published in anthologies such as Best Gay
Erotica
1997 and Wilma Loves Betty, and has garnered praise from Publisher's =
Weekly,
Lambda Book Report and web-zines as far away as Australia, is what makes =
it
dangerous."

McQuain admits that he hasn't been approached by any lawyers wielding
Batarangs
or Bat-cuffs--and he shrugs off any concern about such contact in the
future.
"My story is a love story told from Robin's point-of-view, based on dreams
and
fantasies from my childhood and adolescence. The Robin I refer to, Dick
Grayson, is not even used by DC Comics as Robin anymore--they've revamped
Batman and his attendant characters so many times that the current
incarnations
bear little or no resemblance to the toys I played with as a child or the
characters I watched on TV. And as for playing around with Batman's
sexuality,
it wasn't me who added a codpiece and aroused nipples to his costume in =
the
recent spate of bat-movies! If Batman's homoeroticism is so worrisome, the
powers that be have themselves to thank."  But Robin's bawdy hero worship =
of
his mentor isn't the heart of the issue, stresses McQuain.  "Trust me, I'm
not
getting rich off this story, nor was that ever my plan.  But how can
somebody
tell me I am not allowed to commit a dream or a fantasy I've had onto
paper?  I
think it's interesting and appropriate that a vigilante like Batman would
serve
as the springboard in a disagreement that blurs the line between hero and
villain. But controversies involving free speech often make champions out =
of
the unlikeliest of candidates.  Take a look at Larry Flynt.  Batman should
be
fighting the Legion of Doom or the Riddler--not me."

Still, the imbroglio hasn't dampened McQuain's love of the dark knight or
his
sidekick.  "The best way DC Comics could get me to shut up would be to =
have
me
write a few issues," he smiles.  "That's been a dream of mine.  I wouldn't
exactly overhaul the characters, but I think I could provide Batman with =
the
dose of humor he needs to get his bat-panties out of the bunch they're =
in."
In the meantime, McQuain will continue polishing a first collection of =
short
stories, The Truth of Boys, for which he has just begun to search for a
publisher.  His latest story, "Erasing Sonny" appears in the newly =
released
anthology Men on Men 2000 (Plume).  Along with other contributors to that
anthology, McQuain will be reading at Borders Books in Center City
Philadelphia, 18th and Market Streets, on March 2nd  at 7:30 p.m.

See? Now they are telling dirty nasty anti-Asian jokes! Do you know how
long the Chinese people have been treated as second-class citizens in the
USA? I'll bet you would find that joke hilarious if it was Greek Orthodox
priest.

        It's great to find a letter again from Henry Gould here.

        I miss Henry's postings a lot.  Never figured out why he was more
or less escorted out of the building, so to speak.

        Too many postings?  Henry always had much to say, corrected
himself, jabbed at himself--

        I always admired and respected his passion, his commitment and his
ability to say something off the cuff, on the wing, yet these comments
always were and are born of a deep sense of poetry as a daily
action--whether in reading or writing--

        I remember an early letter, years ago when I first encountered
Henry via the email--he was asking for books for a library--poetry books--

        At the time, I was active in a program--now discontinued--to
obtain books for the prison libraries here in Wisconsin. We
sent tons of books, of all sorts, to the prisons.

        Henry always presents a challenge--which is what any person
welcomes--

        To me, he presents a true love of poetry, I do not care if I agree
with him, or he may have so much to say--I think that is vital, and what
keeps poetry alive.

        Henry signals what is important--that poetry is alive, in
libraries, on the streets, "in your house"--as
 James Brown says in his
great
version of "For Your Precious Love" on the lp BRING IT ON--


        The only thing--Henry, don't apologize so much. There is nothing
wrong in speaking your mind.

        Especially when you have a good mind.

        all best

'femaleness' and 'heterogeneity', in a dynamic and elegant performance of
dialogues with history, identity and sexuality.  If only all
performance-based work had this kind of integrity and magic on the page!

Hugh Steinberg's poetry has appeared in Grand Street, Tinfish, 14 Hills and
American Poetry Review, among others.  His chapbook, "In the Attic of the
House of the Dead" is forthcoming from Chax Press.  He is a board member of
Small Press Traffic and teaches writing at California College of Arts and
Crafts.  Steinberg succeeds most vividly as he mines personal memoir and
memory of the city a la "Rhapsody on a Windy Night," extending Eliotic
signals into the coded futures of weather and ether.  His procedural based
work (e.g. writing a poem a day for a whole year) opens the field of daily
life, mundane existence and stretches it until holes appear, like fine
cambric lace.

there's nothing more I can do with nikuko and doctor leopold konninger in
their present condition, it's better to consider them killed off somewhere
in the midst of a narrative that refuses to stop for them, they might, yes
they will, appear on screen, they might do a dance or two or a trick or
two, but they've gone from the text, they're ghosts, oni, obake, they're

The Department of English at the State University of New York at Albany
invites one page abstracts for our first annual Graduate Student Conference:
"Carto-Graphics: Bodies of Production, Migration, and Subjectivity." We
welcome papers from all intellectual perspectives and traditions, and
encourage participants to consider the trans-disciplinary and extra-academic
dimensions of the conference theme. "Carto-Graphics" arises as a means to
address issues of mapping, representation, and the discursive production of
cultural bodies and spaces. We hope to further examine the plurality of
contexts in which these artifacts--virtual, technical, biological--assume
(and presume) intelligibility.

Possible conference topics are:

* Poetics, Place, and Praxis
* Displacement and Identity in Contemporary Culture
* Expatriates, Exiles, and "Other Communities"
* Creative Geographies/Geography & Literature
* Global Economies, New Industries, Class
* Textual Production and the Future of the Subject
* Space and Meaning in Contemporary Theory
* Cognitive Mapping and Cultural Identities
* Charting Virtual Terrains
* Visual Culture and Nontextual Media
* Travel, Tourism, and Sustainability
* Bio-logics, Ecology, and Cultures of Production
* Dis-ease, Trauma, and Becoming-Cyborg

Deadline for Submissions is February 15, 2000

Please send one page abstracts for panel presentations to:

I am gratified that my work is well-known enuff and widely-read enuff, to
warrent critical comments on the List.  However off-base or sketchy, JD's
comments are welcome as part of the ongoing critical discussion.

Let me just add, for those less familiar with my writing than jacques is,
that it can be seen (of course) in the recent issues of New Orleans Review
and Mirage #4...Issues which feature many atlanta poets, and which have
largely occasioned, i guess, Jacques' several recent mini-attacks.  I also
have work in an issue of the atlanta mag "108"..which has pretty much just
come out.  Details about acquiring all these publications on request...

The chapbook edition of my long poem, Burning Flags, is out of print.
However i've got some copies which are my personal property, and will let
a few of them go, for $8, to interested folks.......

Just for those who wanna now what all the fuss is about...

(1976-78 I worked in the northwest of Haiti, a true Lautreamont-Machine
with extra batteries.I spent the New Year reading Les Chants de Maldoror...)

...a village called L'Arbre without any trees
Sixteen died that week no food to eat (the rats were cracking cottonseed)
only Haitian sun and Haitian night and the song of Maldoror

I had kept my city mangos in a secret sack dark and dry
hoarded against the dust, against the new year when I'd go to the water
five hours walking east sucking mangos in the sucking sun

And lay thinking in the baths made for Pauline,
of her song, my song, the song of others,
the songs of Maldoror and where they were leading me.

I had sung my Song to the frenzied bloodlust of spirits
in silent measure of the night in silent battle with damnation
shedding illusions as I wandered from my inscribed path

I have not forgotten that song, that of the dying,
nor moving in the vortex of souls, the framework of quotidian horror,
nerves pinned to each minute passing, plucked by chants of Maldoror

Somenights I awake thirsting, a song echoing through my garden
and think of mangos

=46rom Hank Lazer and Charles Bernstein, an announcement =

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern =

and Contemporary Poetics, edited by Charles =

Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Translating the Unspeakable
Poetry and the Innovative Necessity
Kathleen Fraser

An accomplished and influential poet, Kathleen Fraser =

has been instrumental in drawing attention to other =

women poets working outside the mainstream. =

Translating the Unspeakable gathers eighteen of her =

essays written over nearly twenty years, combining =

autobiography and criticism to examine what it means =

for any artist to innovate instead of following an already =

traveled path.

Fraser tells how her generation was influenced by =

revolutions in art and philosophy during the early 1960s =

and how she spent years pursuing idiosyncratic means =

of rediscovering the poem=92s terms. By the 1970s her =

evolving poetics were challenged by questions of =

gender, until immersion in feminist/modernist =

scholarship led her to initiate greater dialogue among =

experimentalist poets.

Fraser also examines modernist women writers, their =

contemporary successors, and the visual poetics they =

have practiced. By exploring the work of such poets as =

H. D., Mina Loy, Lorine Niedecker, and Barbara Guest, =

Fraser conveys their struggle to establish a presence =

within accepted poetic conventions and describes the =

role experimentation plays in helping women overcome =

self-imposed silence.

All of Fraser=92s writings explore how the search to find =

one=92s own way of speaking into a very private yet =

historic space=97of translating the unspeakable=97drives =

poetic experimentation for women and men alike. This =

provocative book provides a glimpse into the thought =

processes of the poetic mind, enhancing our =

understanding of innovative writing.

=93These superb essays by Kathleen Fraser take their =

sanction from her long commitment to the craft of poetry =

and to the advocacy of experimental writing by women. =

She speaks with a poet's authority, but with a large and =

articulate awareness of the theoretical and practical =

concerns of contemporary poets. Current discussions of =

contemporary poetry are enormously enriched by these =

complex reflections, revealing Fraser=92s intelligent =

passion for this lifelong vocation, not only as writer but =

as teacher and editor, and her generosity and openness =

to the labors of poets marginalized and occluded within =

the record.=94
 =97Eileen Gregory
 University of Dallas

=93In Kathleen Fraser=92s radiant essays on the poetics of =

innovation we meet the poet thinking her way through =

issues of criticism and craft that have preoccupied many =

of us for decades. Their passionate responsiveness, =

generous spirit, and acute sense of experimental writing =

by women in its recent historic contexts combine to offer =

a rare account of what it has been to walk the tightrope =

of the new.=94=97Carolyn Burke

since the first:

books:

John M. Bennett - Mailer leaves ham -- Pantograph. The distant reach of
what is available soundwise currently. First saw some of these a half
dozen or so years ago, perhaps in the now defunct caliban, or clwn wr or
even john's laft. Also a healthy number of the illustrated transductions
of Emblems of Andreae Alciatti in his unique multi-readable script,
which there is a name for & can't think of right now. Really opens up
the issue of the word as form. Mighty fine.

John Clarke- From feathers to Iron-- Tombouctou. This set me afire when
I first read it & is doing the same after the distance between. A set up
for a unique poetics fully founded within the collected. Also in Blue
Hortals with Dan Z, which my copy of has disappeared, can anyone help me
with one, even photocopied, Dan, Stephen?

Nick Piombino -- Theoretical objects -- Green Integer. This new format
of Doug's is something worth copying, two books from 1, split 6 by 9
into 6 by 4.5. Might even try it for cost. Better yet, the book itself.
Very worth owing. The sentences have a weight and length only matched in
recent writings by Tom Bridwell shown in a recent House Organ(#27). A
gorgeous turn of the comma twists and retwists the idea. A careful
reader needed. With the exception of some weak moments when Piombino
gets into his defilement of the "I," this solidifies and transcends
areas set down in  _Boundary of blur's_ brilliance.

Haniel Long -- The Grist Mill -- The Rydal Press, 1946. Found this in my
recent travels in NM. After _Pittsburgh memoranda_  based on pound's
notion of explaining a location which pre-dates  & pales  _Maximus_
Long dives down. I can see Robert Kelly's poem "The mill of particulars"
in the title poem & both outdo each other in nice rotation shifting from
book to book.

David Bromige - A Cast of Tens - Avec. Except for a water joke in the
poem "While Knitting" which might offend some Welch patrons, the
movement tasting of tens really satisfies. Lost in my move from Philly
to Ohio & glad to have again.

Running low on books & now
time.

Be well

I'm reluctant to drastically re-define the local, thinking it might be
better to come up with another description for those intensities which are
not characterized by a proximity of spacial relations. Space does count for
something, doesn't it? I do believe those other intensities exist, but I
think that even though most of my closest literary relationships are quite
distantly extended, the most intense ones have benefited greatly by times
when those involved have been in the same locality, even if only for a few
days. And that periodic renewal of such direct ties by collapsing the far
spaces during various visits have been crucial to the relationships. My
take on this, with the last twenty-two years having been spent in Madison,
Minneapolis, or Tucson -- all places where such relationships, for me, were
primarily long-distance and constantly changing ones, is certainly
different than those who have maintained presence in communities where
their main relationships have been local and constant.

I got them used, believe it or not, at the Salvation Army - and haven't
done anything with the riemann zeta function. I was looking for the books
for years - there's a lot on binary systems, which merges with another
book I found, called, appropriately enough, Binary Systems... - Alan
(P.S. the Flatbush Ave. Brooklyn Salvation Army is pretty good; there's
also wonders to be had at our local library branch on Pacific and Fourth,
as well as a weekend bookseller on Sixth Avenue and Fifth Street (all

I want briefly to draw attention to this comment, which
comes at the end of rather a long post and so may have
been missed by some.
     I, too, have been on the list for several years,
and of course have been moderator for a fraction of that
time. One use I have not often seen the list put to by its
subscribers, and to which it may lend itself quite well,
is as a forum for comprehensive remarks on specific books
or poems - or, as Komninos Zervos has just pointed out,
remarks on web-based writing and art. It's a lack I've
always taken to be of a piece with the more general absence
of review-articles that characterizes so many of our journals
and zines; but which is as inexplicable as it is regrettable,
given that most writers soon prove to be highly opinionated
(and generally wrong, I might say in jocund mood).

I don't know what one could do to encourage this sort
of thing, save to suggest that the next time anyone out
there runs across a book or poem or story of particular
interest, I'd like to hear about the source of that
interest as much as would Randy; and that discussion
of specific works might prove a vital component to any
ongoing conversation. I think that the list is useful
for such exchange for a number of reasons: its wide reach
and relative speed, also the  informality of writing that
is allowable here; indicating that, lacking time, one
need not write a formal review in order publicly to express
one's thoughts on a piece of writing or art, though it goes
without saying some depth of consideration would be the
clearest expression of interest. The list may also be a
good medium for "hammering out" ideas for a more
comprehensive article destined to appear elsewhere.

My apologies if it came across that I accused you of being a bigot.  =
That certainly wasn't my point.  I hardly have definitive evidence that =
you are a bigot.

I did suggest you were acting in an ignorant fashion by not apologizing. =
 I was asking you to consider that your joke might touch upon a =
sensitive issue.  You can defend the double reading, and I will return =
to you the benefit of the doubt, but I did not see what was so difficult =
about saying, "hey, if it came across in such a way, I'm sorry."

So, David, I am sorry. =20

And to the posts from others on this subject (Randolph, Maria, Brian, =
George), I have managed to come to my senses. =20

<sarcasm>Apparently anti-Irish prejudice has never existed in this =
world, and still does not, except of course in my "pea-brained" =
imagination.   Or, rather, anti-Irish prejudice doesn't really matter =
because the Irish are white or because the Irish, even Irish Catholics, =
are now enfranchised in America.  Silly me.  Perhaps I've also imagined =
the totality of anti-Semitism.  Or that Billy and I are both overly =
sensitive.  Perhaps sensitive people should not take interest in poetry. =
 </sarcasm>

Of course I do remember a conversation I had in Vienna (Cafe Strozzi) =
with an Austrian who told me the Irish were "ignorant drunk apes" who =
"shouldn't be allowed to reproduce."   Or a certain southern =
Presbyterian family that wouldn't let their daughter marry an Irish =
Catholic.  What thigh-slappin' fun!=20

Of course I could have been dreaming of a better world. . . .

So let's all have a laugh.  I DO have a sense of humor, if you can =
believe it.

On Irishness and its Zen-like approach to life . . .

An Englishman, an American and an Irishman are called upon to test a lie =
detector. The Englishman says: "I think I can empty 20 bottles of beer". =
BUZZZZZZ, goes the lie detector. "Ok", he says, "10 bottles". And the =
machine is silent. The American says: "I think I can eat 15 hamburgers". =
BUZZZZZZ, goes the lie detector. "Alright, 8 hamburgers". And the =
machine's silent. The Irish says: "I think...", BUZZZZZZ goes the =
machine.


On the Irish talents with novel "out of the box" solutions to old =
problems . . .

Two Irishmen met in a pub and discussed the illness of a third.
  "Poor Michael Hogan! Faith, I'm afraid he's goin' to die."
  "Shure, an' why would he be dyin'?" asked the other.
  "Ah, he's gotten so thin. You're thin enough, and I'm thin -- but by =
my
soul, Michael Hogan is thinner than both of us put together."


On Irish problem-solving talents, take 2 . . .

The Irish attempt on Mount Everest was a valiant effort, but it failed: =
They
ran out of scaffolding.


On Irish optimism in the face of injury and danger . . .

  O'Connell was staggering home with a pint of booze in his back pocket =
when he
slipped and fell heavily. Struggling to his feet, he felt something wet =
running
down his leg.
  "Please, God," he implored, "let it be blood!"


On the innocence of the Irish, take 1 . . .=20

What are the best ten years of an Irishman's life?
         Third grade.


On the innocence of the Irish, take 2 . . .

How can you identify an Irish pirate?
         He's the one with patches over both eyes.


On the honesty and moral turpitude of the Irish . . .

Paddy was picked up on a rape charge. He was placed in a lineup with ten
other fellows and the accusing woman was escorted into the room.
  Paddy jumped forward, and screamed "That's her! That's her! Oi'd =
recognize
her anywhere!"


And finally, on the philosophical complexity of the Irish, particularly =
on the problem of personal identity . . .

Two Irishmen met and one said to the other, "Have ye seen Mulligan =
lately,Pat?" Pat said, "Well, I have and I haven't." His friend asked, =
"Shure, and what d'ye mean by that?" Pat said, "It's like this, =
y'see...I saw a chap who I thought was Mulligan, and he saw a chap that =
he thought was me. And when we got up to one another...it was neither of =
us."=20


Thank you,
Patrick

I couldn't think of a better topic since the hangman disappeared. Here I
am writing you at midnight! It's as if everyone stopped breathing just for
a moment. I know I did!
218:413) Julu            01:10:00:00:05
Hey Jennifer, I didn't know you were on! I feel that the air's cleared
around here. If I hear the word "ballet" I'm going to throw up! Enough
already! It was a stupid conceit!
218:414) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:10
Yeah, a conceit - that's exactly what it was. A trope or lever to explain
just about everything in the world. As if you could squeeze blood out of a
stone. Nothing is farther from the truth.
218:415) Julu            01:10:00:00:12
Exactly - but truth is simultaneously centrifugal and decentered. It's the
lack of the eye, all that perspectival machinery. We're just coming to
grips with it.
218:416) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:15
Just like those pirouettes, as if there were a body at the center of them.
Her skirt kept flying up, and there was nothing there. An avatar, or woman
of Lacan. In masquerade, burdened by the lack, shattered.
218:417) Julu            01:10:00:00:18
Well, there's no more to it, and his writing avatar discourse itself is
getting stale. He's taken you and I around the bend, and meanwhile there
is e-commerce to think about, all that corporate supernumerary exchange.
It doesn't appear anywhere in his work; he's completely ignored the poli-
tical economy of the Internet.
218:418) Julu            01:10:00:00:21
He's placed bodies in the way. The Net's about "streaming video, it's
about streaming music," and he's back there with a vision or version of
flesh and disappearance. He doesn't realize even the imaginary is disap-
pearing - everything replaced by the monetary clot.
218:419) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:24
That gets back to his theory of the self as a coagulation - now the imag-
inary itself is a coagulation, running between flesh and machine, swollen
with flickering and competitive protocols. There are no rooms left for the
avatars, and even human speech is always already stolen speech - from
selves, machines, corporate entities which are themselves streaming.
218:420) Julu            01:10:00:00:29
Do you mean our days are numbered?
218:421) Jennifer        01:10:00:00:30
At least our conversations are.

Will I have to spend another century beleagured by this Demon woman? At the
Moosehead conference she would always scuttle to my side just when the
photographers from The Kenyan Review were flashing their flashes. Put her
hand in my pocket one time. She was drinking something light green, and a
lot of it. Nice enough looking woman, but I was at this conference to
advance my career as a poem-adjuster.

All my life I have noticed that people who do not get certain kinds of
humour get resentful or angry and try to defend themselves against some
attack that has not happened. They must make strange readings indeed of
Samuel Beckett.

It's too bad, but most of us know of something they just dont understand.
I, for instance, do not understand why or how "American Beauty" is a great
movie. I thought that it was filled with stereotypes usually thought to
have been recently discovered by people in their twenties.

Sometime when I have time (perhaps when I finish reading all 236 books at
my bedside) I would like to write a long poem that would consist of
***abstracts**** of recently published mainstream/workshop type poems
alternating with abstracts of recently
published innovative/radical/experimental/linguocentric poems.
Summarize each poem in 25 words or less. Do ten of each. For the
mainstream ones I would perhaps rely heavily on APR and the New
Yorker.

Would anybody be interested in doing this as a collaboration off the list?
(What do you think, Ms. Airam Nomad?)

Yes!
But it is of interest to note that there was a time during the profusion of
tenements in NYC that Blacks were considered more trustworthy, ambitious,
clean and reliable than their Eastern European, Jewish, Italian and Irish
immigrant counterparts, and were therefore a slumlord's preferred tenants.
This before the repudiation you reference below, Mara, the advent of skin
privilege and the agency it afforded everyone but Blacks, in such a short
period of time.
A visit to the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side provided this
information.  I recommend any one of their tours to anyone living in or
visiting NYC.  It is an excellent way to learn about social and political
conditions of NYC before the turn of the century.  Although I saw no faded
signs reading "Blacks only need apply" on any threshold.

dear poetics-listers,

  I want it to be understood that of the 14 people
in NZ on the list I am probably the least
 qualified to make any general
  statement about poetry &
    poetics in New Zealand.
But the enquiries keep coming in
& nobody here seems to answer.
  So I will.

  I live alone on the North Shore of
Auckland.  I no longer go across
the bridge into Auckland
  to teach art history at the university. I
have never taught about
 English or American literature.
& I have never been anthologised.

  I dont get to read poems aloud
anymore.  (Are there readings in Auckland
any more?)  &
I'm not writing much
poetry at present.

  My contacts are, as ever, more
with artists than poets.  My
main writing concern is with writing I'm
 doing about some rather particular
readings of paintings by the French
17th century painter Poussin.  This
is never far removed from issues in
poetics in the broad sense of the
way the arts get done.  Apart from that
 I'm taking photographs which are
 closely related to my poetry energies
Some of these photos have appeared
 in  www.flim.com

   I do have contact with one magazine in which
several of the NZ contemporaries that I most
respect publish regularly: ABDOTWW  which is
short for A Brief Description of The Whole World.
This quarterly was founded by Alan Loney, who
 edited 12 numbers, before passing the editorship to
John Geraets.   I suggest that those who are enquiring
about published NZ poetry begin by reading this
photocopy magazine.
     There are other magazines.  They will perhaps speak for
themselves.  There is _Salt_ edited by Hamish Dewe.  It
looks quite interesting.
 Address for ABDOTWW: the Writers Group, 11-20 Poynton
Terrace, Auckland 1001, New Zealand.
 Email: geraets@internet.co.nz
                   Currently I have more connection with poetry
& poetics through this list than in New Zealand.

randy, thanks for your thoughtful comments which i'll respond to at greater
length when i have an opportunity.  let me just say for now that the worst
aspect of so-called exp or oppostional poetry at the present moment is *our*
pervasive careerism.  in some ways reading an exp poem has become as easy as
reading anything in the new yorker & as straight-jacketed by aesthetic
conventions.   whatever else it is, the apg is also an expedient for
attracting attention--that is, for advancing the careers of the poets
associated with it.  there are other ways of doing that of course--start up a
reading series, a magazine, a small press, etc., etc.,  & publish people who
you think will be helpful to you, or write glowing reviews of books you are
only lukewarm about, or . . . I could go on & on.  & I don't pretend to stand
above this trend at all--like everyone else i swim in the same swill.  of
course i'm not alone in thinking this--not by any means-- but the next move
too often seems to me to be a conservative one--a return to a more "natural"
poetry, etc.,--& i'm  wondering instead how an oppositional poetic can take
new forms?

"One use I have not often seen the list put to by its
subscribers, and to which it may lend itself quite well,
is as a forum for comprehensive remarks on specific books
or poems - or, as Komninos Zervos has just pointed out,
remarks on web-based writing and art." Chris


1. i would like to invite people on this list to check out some sites and
let the list know what they think of them.
the first one is a site run by luigi bob drake and is a site for web
poets/cyberpoets/net poets, to post new works and get comments from other
poets. it is a sort of experimental site for poetry, but not necessarily
experimental poetry.

http://www.burningpress.org/wreyeting/index.html

2. another great introduction to the kinds of things that poets are doing
on the world wide web, is this french site, but you will need the flash
plugin(easy download from the site)

http://www.aix-art-contemporain.org/cine_video/imageswebart/anims_f/anims.html

3. and for an individual site, well a site created by two people, reiner
strasser and christy sheffield sanford, an individual piece of cyberpoetry
called 'water'.
http://workxspace.de/div/water_p.html

let me briefly review this poem.
these days texts are made up of many elements, sound, images, words, and
interactive devices which allow flexible navigation.
virtualization of the text has produced new actualizations in cyberspace,
poetry which operates in spaces rather than surfaces.
'water' is an example of post-hypertext poetry on the web.
what we associate now with the term hypertext is that kind espoused by
landow, eastgate software, and others.
hypertext which is largely text-based and actualizes post-structuralist and
postmodern literary theory, and so its potential is fully realized, as such.
'water' is a text which stimultes all of the senses.
'water' works the field of nostalgia, past associations, evolutionary
associations, images and sound drawing you into its being, its unfolding,
its realization, seemingly from nowhere(you cant see the next bit on the
next page, or even know there is a next bit).
the piano is a nostalgic device, slow, calming, the initial image is
blurred and misty and fills the screen, a harbour, but this is not a static
image and i am not a static observer.
as i move my mouse, over the image from top to bottom, the image gets
sliced into five or six bands, certain bands either getting foggier or
becoming more sharply in focus, each band throwing up a dialogue box of
text, a few words, a sentence, and each movement over a band causing some
change in the other bands of images, sometimes switching to a band from
another misty image, a river marina, a river or lake in flood.
clicking on the bands takes you to other scenes with similar fragmentation
of image into interactive bands which deliver text, sound and image.
one navigates till there is a sense of i've seen it all, till nothing new
seemed to happen. the journey through this poem gave me the feeling of
floating, immersed, involved, self-reflective.
i didn't even check the source code.

(Report from Hank Lazer)


Field Work: APG, January 5, 2000

With some trepidation, I drove slightly over 200 miles eastward =

to spend an evening reading and conversing with the APG.  I =

met two senior members of the APG at a holding facility (Caf=E9 =

Diem) about an hour before the official meeting.  While in the =

holding facility, we began an energetic discussion of poetry and =

poetics, and we began to pass around recent books and =

magazines.  Then, we adjourned to the primary meeting, in an =

apartment (well-stocked with books, records, CDs, and cats) =

on a street aptly named High-land.  Seven members of the APG =

were in attendance, and the evening began with informal =

conversation and a meal of (excellent) vegetarian pizza and beer =

(the brand names in no way revealing a particularly imitative =

allegiance to Buffalo or San Francisco).  The lighting in the =

meeting room was a bit dark, and I could not determine if that =

had been a natural effect or the result of the much mentioned =

shadow cast over the group by langpo.  Both food and =

conversation seemed quite genuine, and I must note that my =

initial observations did not reveal an over abundance of =

excessively derivative or imitative behavior.

Then we moved into the readings portion of the evening.  John =

Lowther began with several new poems, some working with =

materials about Marcel Duchamp.  He also passed around a =

framed found-object and a mounted poem-object.  His readings =

were energetic and engaging; the methods for the Duchamp =

poems quite interesting.  In response to his Duchamp poems, I =

read the first poem from my Negation series (which includes a =

spine-text from Hegel=92s Phenomenology of Mind).  I suppose =

that there was some element of call-and-response in reading my =

poem back to John.  My memory grows a bit hazy on the exact =

order of reading, but the readers included Randy Prunty (poems =

working out of his recent readings of Oppen), Brian (I=92m =

blanking on his last name=97a poem which seemed somewhat =

Creeley-ish in its use of short lines and odd line breaks; the =

poem sparked an extended discussion of Creeley=92s work, and =

also of =93zen=94-elements in the poem), Dana (again, blank on last =

name; short O=92Hara-ish poems, some with found elements, =

stemming from recent family/home visit in NYC), Tedd (several =

poems, one in particular with a rather interesting spatial =

arrangement on the page, as if two columns of poems engaged =

one another in a kind of implied dialog), James Sanders (read an =

absolutely hilarious selection from his booklet Haikus to Chuck =

Woolery, titles include Despair Bunny; Some Kind of Keanu =

Reeves;  Sitting Next to You, Shining; A Mind Hiding an =

Acoustic Panel; Bureaucracies of Joy; and Cary Grant Meets =

the Incredible Hulk); and Mark Presjnar played tapes of his =

multi-voiced compositions (the beginning, I think, of an exciting =

new direction for Mark=92s work).  After a run to restock the =

beer, I read from a new series of poems.  It seems like I read =

for about thirty minutes, but my sense of time had begun to fade, =

as I had worked a half day that morning at my desk job, and I =

was beginning to fall under the spell of the local community.  My =

poems included words like =93god,=94 =93soul,=94 and the hebrew word =

=93teshuvah=94 (meaning =93a turning=94).  These were designed, of =

course, to call out (by means of aversion) the spirits of derivative
avant-gardism and imitative fragmentariness among the practitioners of
the
APG.  There were, however, no screams, and no one, to the best of my
recollection, collapsed in an Oz- witch-like pool of goo.  In fact, what
followed was a rather stimulating discussion of modes of lyricism, with
lots of reference to John Taggart=92s work (I am quite enthralled with hi=
s
new book, When the Saints) and Robert Duncan, as well as to a discussion
of some foundational contradictions and tensions within the current
(many
different) practices of =93new=94 poetries.

Except for the occasional lighting of incense and praying in the =

direction of the axes of Buffalo/New York and San Francisco / =

The West Coast, and except for the lighted shrines in memory of =

the first generation of langpoets, I noticed nothing that would =

suggest that this version of the local and that this version of the =

group was in some way inauthentic and utterly unoriginal.  In =

fact, I was impressed by the variety of writing that had been =

presented.  And the group dynamics=97mutual respect and =

consideration=97struck me as quite admirable.  Indeed, the =

members of the group admit quite openly that they are each at =

quite different stages of acquaintance/knowledge/development in =

their reading and writing.  Their professions are quite =

varied=97from librarians, to lawyers, to some part-time returning =

students, to managers, to caregivers (for an elderly couple).  =

And, as someone who grew up in San Jose but who has now =

lived in Tuscaloosa, Alabama for twenty-three years, I =

wondered how well others living in more vibrant, =93cooler=94 cities =

could understand the particularities of living in Atlanta, or =

Tuscaloosa, and how and why and in what ways people might =

come together to read and write and eat and converse.

I returned early the next morning to Tuscaloosa (to resume a =

fairly busy desk job), and found myself on and off over the next =

few days thinking quite pleasantly about a thoroughly enjoyable =

evening with the APG.  With this brief summary, I send to the =

Poetics List an account of my sojourn among the APG.  =


I am also reading and reflecting upon a rather marvelous book =

by Ed Foster, Answerable to None, which itself raises, in a fine =

Emersonian way, serious questions about community and =

individuality.  Ed, for example, in writing about Bronk and =

Thoreau, suggests, by way of Thoreau,

    that man thinking and working alone is by no means =

    merely solipsistic or self-deluding; there are =93common =

    interests=94 from which we all proceed.  Thoreau=92s ideal =

    was the self-sufficient man, he who welcomes solitude =

    and silence, not institutions and laws, as the origin of =

    truth.  Friendship in turn is not a matter of getting along =

    with others, a purely social function; friendship arises =

    from a mutual ability =93to nourish and care for the spirit.=94  =

    Thoreau in short provides the example of the man who =

    does not exile himself from society and is no =

    misanthrope yet understands that truth is not a social or =

    communal matter; you don=92t reach truth by way of a =

    committee.  If there is an ideal community, it is a group =

    of people thinking and working alone=97the antithesis of =

    what community has generally been assumed to be.

I suppose that I personally am drawn to both notions of =

community, writing as I do in some kind of alone-situation in =

Tuscaloosa (and in correspondence with others working =

similarly, such as John Taggart, Jake Berry, and Ted Enslin), but =

also being quite drawn to instances of a more tangible, local =

community of writers, as I experienced in visiting the APG.  I =

find it well worthwhile to think through these complexities of =

affiliation and mutuality, of how to proceed socially in this activity
of
reading and writing.

I've only been on the list for a short time, and looked into it because I am
now gaining an interest in seeing what else is out there. I, for one, (or to
add another) would be greatly interested in hearing what those on the list
have to say about this or that piece.
It's fact enough when a novice to the poetic community enters, there is a
throng of information attacking them before they can even adjust their sight.
For me, it would prove very beneficial to have a few ideas and thoughts
thrown out there by other's reviews to aid in what I decide to pick up next.

Just contributing my enthusiasm for the idea.
Thanks Randy, for bringing it up and Chris for pointing it out again.

Hi all,   I've caught this thread sporadically so I don't want to make a
specific argument regarding who said what to whom, who's on the ball
regarding when a joke is funny, etc.  But I strongly sympathize w/ Brian
Stefans insistence on the labyrinthine complexity of race-matters in U.S.
space (as in other multiethnic spaces I would think).  I've been thinking
alot about this question of "Irish negritude" as we might call it.
Michael Gizzi has a joke in one of his new poems which will be in the next
COMBO: "Is it any wonder," he muses, "that ivory hunters are music lovers
or that black Irish are often black."  Likewise, I saw a bumper sticker
once - less complex to be sure - that read: "I'm black Irish: Top o' the
mornin' to yo' ass."  The "black Irish" joke is quite real, having to do,
as has already been mentioned with a very long history of British figuring
of the Irish as a "dusky race" etc.  But it's more than this: Cromwell
sold Irish people into slavery in the West Indies, something WC Williams
brings up in PATERSON:

         "Cromwell, in the middle of the seventeenth century,
shipped some thousands of Irish women and children to the Barbadoes to be
sold as slaves.  Forced by the owners to mate with the others these
unfortunates were succeeded by a few generations of Irish-speaking negroes
and mulattos.  And it is commonly asserted to this day the natives of
Barbadoes speak with an Irish brogue."

I happen to have a friend who's a scholar in this area (luck o' the
Irish?) and have included below her response to a query of mine regarding
what Williams says here.  Suffice to say, it's true.

One classic tactic of the powerful is to pit the marginalized against each
other by inventing the myth of upward mobility ("our people have the
nicest apartments in the projects!") and then let 'em duke it out on the
margin.  When I read about the NYC conscription riots of the 1860's, or
the Boston busing riots of the 1970's, in which racism *by* the Irish and
violence *by* the Irish against African-Americans was so vicious, I get
nauseated.  The irony and sadness and absurdity of it is too much.

I have a grandmother, June Rooney, whose eccentricity we've always
"explained" within the family by calling her "shanty Irish" - is that a
common term?  I don't even know; but it stands in in lieu of a complex
description of how a history of poverty makes you nuts, even if benignly
so.  How this fits in with what I've said above I'm not completely sure,
but anyway, perhaps something here is food for thought.  I've read some of
the articles & books listed below and they're quite illuminating.

It's a bit late, I guess, but here's my short list of books, what I've been
dipping into in the last few weeks:

Bob Perelman's new selected poems, Ten To One (it's great to have so many of
his old and new poems under one cover and to be able to follow the
development of his
style or sensibility or whatever)

The Darkness of God by Denys Turner (a serious overview of epistemology in
Catholic mysticism.)

The User Illusion by Tor Norretranders (abt consciousness, information sciece
and thermodynamics. Provocative though just slightly dated.)

Pierre by Melville (a very strange book, I think.)

So do I get the last word on this subject?

(I'm forwarding this because I love Leslie Thornton's work and urge you to
see it if you have the chance - it's a relatively rare opportunity. The
films touch directly on issues of virtuality, language, subjectivity, and

Announcing:

PEGGY AND FRED IN HELL
a film and video serial by

LESLIE THORNTON

January 20, 2000, 6:00pm

at the
Whitney Museum
in the program
The Cool World: Film and Video in America 1950-2000
[Part 2 of The Art of the Century]


        "Leslie Thornton's Peggy and Fred in Hell is one of the most
astonishing and complex achievements in avant-garde cinema
in the  last twenty years."

                    - Patrick Friel of Chicago Filmmakers


   Peggy and Fred in Hell is a feature-length serial of film and video
episodes drawn broadly around the adventures of two small children living
in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The children flit in and out of the
picture, as the noisy remains of our familiar world spin out of control.
Hilarious and disturbing, Peggy and Fred unsettles the categories of film
and video art: it is a continuous work in progress, a proto-narrative of
enduring suspense-a document of the vivid domain of childhood contaminated
by the ghost of constant television. This eclectic serial comes on like
The Perils of Pauline meeting Eraserhead via Godard. The screening/instal-
lation at theWhitney includes all nine episodes, with film and video
running simultaneously.

     For over twenty years Leslie Thornton has helped keep the horizons
of avant-garde media open and relevant. Her sustained interrogation of
narrative, beauty, and culture is a refreshing departure from the cynical
tendencies of post-modernist art-making. Bill Krohn writes in Cahiers du
Cinema, that "[Thornton's] place in cinema history has already been
assured for the sole reason that she is the author of Peggy and Fred in
Hell. Forever unfinished, [her] magnum opus resembles nothing else known.
. . No matter how she chooses to complete Peggy and Fred -if she ever
does-the film will live eternally as a psychic landscape of the 90's,
unraveling into a never-ending poem or nightmare."

   Leslie Thornton is a Recipient of the Maya Deren Award for Lifetime
Achievement, as well as the first Alpert Award in Media, two Rockefeller
Fellowships, and numerous other grants and awards. She lives in Brooklyn
and Providence, Rhode Island, where she teaches filmmaking at Brown
University.

  The Whitney screening presents two new episodes: Chimp for Normal Short,
which premiered at the 1999 New York Film Festival, and the American
premiere of Bedtime.

The program includes the complete series:

-Peggy and Fred in Hell: The Prologue, 16mm, b/w, , 21min.,1984
-Peggy and Fred in Kansas, video, b/w, 11 min., 1987
-Peggy and Fred and Pete, video, sepia, 23 min., 1988
-{Dung Smoke Enters the Palace}, b/w, 16mm & video, 16 min.,1989
-Introduction to the So-called Duck Factory, video, b/w, 7 min., 1990
-Whirling, video, color, 2 min., 1996
-The Problem So Far, 16mm film and video, b/w, 7 min., 1996
-Chimp for Normal Short, 16mm, sepia, 6 min., 1999
-Bedtime, video, b/w, 2 min., 2000

  Leslie Thornton has five other works showing in different group programs
in The Cool World: Film and Video in America 1950-2000. These include
Adynata (1983, 16mm), ...or lost (1997, 16mm), Strange Space (1993,

Walserian Waltzes by Gad Hollander

The "Walserian" in the title refers to the Swiss writer Robert Walser, who
Kafka named as one of his greatest influences. Perhaps the politest writer
of the early 20th century, Walser was also a diagnosed schizophrenic, and
Hollander's use of his tragic biography is subtle, moving, and brilliant.

o

GAD HOLLANDER'S Walserian Waltzes is a sequence of meditations on madness,
writing, death, and identity. Focusing on a character split between the
first-person singular pronoun and his own name-a character who may or may
not be dead and may or may not be insane, a character whose goal is to
become "a self-made failure"-Hollander skillfully leads us to contemplate
the paradoxical trajectories of language, the subjective and objective
worlds it seems to create and destroy. Anyone looking for prose that
combines the compressed and elusive qualities of poetry with the abstract
resonance of philosophy will find Walserian Waltzes a richly satisfying
experience.
-Stephen-Paul Martin, author of THE GOTHIC TWILIGHT and FEAR &
PHILOSOPHY

GAD HOLLANDER has the mind of a philosopher, the heart of an artist, the
language of a poet-and the literary soul of a modern-day Kafka. Walserian
Waltzes takes us on an unforgettable tour through the devastated landscape
of a ruined mind. The access to Perception is through a revolving door.
-FIRST INTENSITY MAGAZINE

List Price: $11 . 92 pages. ISBN:1880713-21-7.

Parable


Why dogs don't have horns. In bygone days, male dogs had horns centered in
their high and bony foreheads. The horns were symbols of their prowess,
and many a villager was kept awake at night by ferocious fighting - the
horns clattering against each other. One day Nikuko was wending her way
from the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being, she allowed her mind
to drift. Suddenly, a ferret crossed the road in front of her. In a split
second, Nikuko and the ferret changed places, Nikuko now running low upon
the ground, working the roads as cross-walks, heading in and out of the
deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough, a dog approached, its horn hard
against the sky. Nikuko was sweating and naked, her skin scratched by
brambles, her breath hot and heavy from running. The dog lowered its head,
Nikuko exchanged places with the horn. The horn fell useless to the ground
and disappeared forever; Nikuko, astride the dog, changed places with a
bee, a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a ferret, in just that very order.
Now cooled by the shadows of dusk among the bamboo, she continued on her
way. A monk passed by, laughing, and asked, Nikuko, after all this play,
are you any the wiser? Nikuko replied, not in the slightest, Izanagi, not
the least little bit.

Subject:      of Sithiwong and Mangoes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,


I thought Rebecca Weldon Sithiwong's poem beautiful,
dark but beautiful. I don't know _Les Chants de
Maldoror_ and don't read French, but I suppose it's
got to be in English too.

"L'Arbre without any trees/ Sixteen died that week no
food to eat (the rats were cracking cottonseed)" This
really gives me chills.

But then the mangoes...  I've always thought of
mangoes as the sexiest fruit.  A perfect peach is
quite nice but even bruised mango seems to suggest
more.

And so the conflict comes as I find myself swirling in
associations, associations building off of "And lay
thinking in the baths made for Pauline, of her
song..." associations in my imagination of haiti as
hot and bright, thoughts of sweat and mangoes, rich
colors... and then death.  And I don't like death with
my sex or violence with my sex and so this gets under
my skin and I guess that's something of why it's a
powerful poem?

Sincerely,

Marla

Subject:      Am I regional or local?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,

I'm not sure what I have to offer to the thread about
the local.  I'd never thought about my poet self as a
local poet self or a regional poet self.  I've heard
people called "regional writers" before and that
seemed to mean that they wrote about the region.  And
when I've heard of someone as a "local poet" I just
assumed it meant they were nearby.

Maybe an ism-word is called for? A regional-ism? A
local-ism?  But ism-ending words make people (maybe I
should say me) uncomfortable, they suggest exclusion
somehow even if when I think about it more there is no
reason that would have to.

And then I think about my own poems and though they
are always an outgrowth of my life, my desires, the
things around me that repeat and start to become
luminous somehow, I cannot help but to agree they are,
like I am, set down here in the South. My job takes me
into South Carolina and all around Georgia and
sometimes, rarely, to Florida and Tennessee.  And I
wonder if by being parts of my life, as it moves
through this region, whether they might not also be
"regional" or "regionalist" in some way.

With the idea of localism I keep thinking about
audience. I think this is because until I bumped into
the Atlanta poets I didn't think of there being an
audience for my poems. I have two friends who are
poets, Gina and Joseph, but they've been friends for
years and so I never thought of them as an audience
any more than I thought of myself that way. But now
that there are other poets in Atlanta who know me a
little and who I know a little also it does feel like
I have an audience, a very small one, for whom I
seldom appear, but still an audience. That has made
think more about poetry. And my interactions with this
list wouldn't be, if I hadn't heard about it from
them.  And come to think of it, two of my favorite
books I wouldn't know about it if weren't for these
other locals making a loan and a suggestion.

There have also been interesting contacts from this
list too, but I don't know if it feels right to call
these fine folks "local" (hi).

I don't feel like I have done much to help the thread
along. But maybe my position as someone, settled in a
region and aware of a local, if still floating along
by myself, might mean something to someone.

Sincerely,

Marla

Hear ye hear ye hear ye!!! Legendary Austin, TX poet Hoa Nguyen is getting
ready to run her third on-line workshop on WriteNet.  This is a wonderful
opportunity for your students and/or children (grades 9 - 12 only,
please) to have a weekly resource/community to discuss their own
writing.  Hoa provides students with bi-weekly poetry writing assignments,
and then analyzes and critiques their responses to her exercises.  To view
the previous two workshops, go to www.writenet.org and hit the "Virtual
Poetry Workshop" link.

If your students are interested in participating, please tell them to send
2 - 4 poems to Hoa via e-mail at nguyenhoa@hotmail.com NO LATER THAN THE
27TH OF JANUARY.  Hoa will read the poems, choose 9 students to work with,
and run an eight-week long workshop.  Regular and committed participation
on the part of your students is absolutely required.

It's a great thing, it's free (funding thanks to National Endowment for
the Arts) and young poets should shriek with delight and jump at this
opportunity.

best,

Yes, "collapsing the far spaces" periodically seems almost essential,
especially for those of us raised in "literary centers" like New York City
and/or San Francisco, but have left for less congenial places.  Automobiles,
trains, airplanes, already seem primitive modes of transportation to me,
time-consuming, expensive, and polluting. And the web, at this point, like
the first telephones, engenders a "phony" communal ring.

The rupture of centers does, however, encourage the publication of serious
work from sundry places. I can remember when if you didn't live in New York
you weren't taken seriously by publishers. It was a few farsighted editors,
like Don Allen and James Laughlin, who began to change this.

This aside, an aspect to electronic communication that I haven't seen
discussed is that one is, or could be, ageless on the web. Thus, although
the web can't collapse "the far spaces" in a fleshly manner, it can collapse
the space between generations. This brings up a whole new set of social, and
institutional, values.

1.

hello. it's me again. i know. i know
 what i said, and yes i called my last
 posting "Last Words" meaning it to
 be my last words to this list for the

time being. call it a failed new year's
 resolution. you see i concocted that
 prong of my multipart new years res
 some months ago. i even posted

about it. back then. you can check the archive
 if you want. but don't bother. it doesn't matter.
 it seems that many people have assumed

that i decided to ditch the list b/c
 of jacques' recent comments about the a.p.g.
 it's an understandable assumption.  but.


2.

it's not the case.  jacques may actually
 be why i've decided to rejoin the list so
 quickly. that and i started reading the
 archives of other lists and didnt see a

hell of a lot that made me want to sign up
 anywhere else. i'm not slagging any other
 lists by saying that, just noting that i didn't
 see much to get ~me~ going. and then i've

been touched. warmed. (in the "cockles"
 of my heart) (what the hell are cockles?
 did i spell it right? it's something my dad

used to say) (anyway) a number of people
 wrote me saying they were sorry i was
 sighing off. signing off. you know what i'm


3.

going for there. anyway, i was surprised
 by that. & a few folks had things to say that
 made me think: hey! i like that, that thinking,
 i'd listen to more of that, etc... so here i am.

back where i was. wondering what's to talk
 about. i thought it was funny that david bromige,
 in quoting a bit out of my last words post
 called it a "poem." maybe it was. does putting

something into tercets make it a poem ?
 i've never been sure about that but thanx david.
 there are lots of things that i have never been

sure about. i'm sure you feel the same way. but,
 feel free to contradict. i think it was judith roitman,
 who, before i peeled out of here some days ago


4.

asked "what is language poetry" and some folks
 did respond i think altho i didnt see all the posts
 that went by, a few were mentioned to me. bob
 archambeau (did i spell that correctly, sorry if not)

referred people to an essay by n.tarn and said
 something about "disjunctivitis." i read the essay
 a long time ago and didn't really get much going
 with it then. perhaps i should read it again. i don't

think i will. but maybe i will. anyway, if i'm
 recalling this correctly, ron silliman responded
 to the disjunctivitis thing and wasn't very

impressed by it as a characterization. who wd be ?
 bob archambeau ? it seems to me at least that
 there are some grave difficulties in using "langpo"


5.

in a sentence. on the one foot, there is good
 reason to delimit "langpo" (broken out into
 "language poets") to a finite number of people
 and a certain period in recent memory.  but it seems

that the tide of usage is turning the other way.
 since signing off this list a few days ago i have
 occupied myself with a bunch of house related
 chores. in particular there is a plant, or actually

a number of different plants. an "invader species".
 theyve taken up residence in the front corner
 of my yard. the neighbor on that side isnt pleased

as they send out runners and sprout all over.
 somebody told me that if you let one go for
 a couple of years you'll never get rid of it. i tried


6.

digging it up. it seems that it sprouted
 first in two maybe three spots. and
 they're widely spaced. but theyre also
 connected. which is pretty cool in some

ways. that is, as i crawled across the lawn
 chopping at the ground a bit to loosen
 the dirt and then pulling up another foot
 or two of root, i started to have a good

deal of respect for this invader species.
 i think it may be called privet. i don't
 know for sure. it doesnt matter to me.

anyway, one root stretched a good 20 feet
 & shot off smaller roots that also had to
 be chased down and pulled up. it was


7.

a monsterous undertaking and if i am to
 succeed in getting all of these plants
 out of my yard it will take a lot more
 than the 4 or so hours i've spent doing it.

i'm guessing 20+ hours will be needed
 to pull up the three main sites and chase
 all the roots and get the little spots too.
 this plant is pretty adaptable it seems. if it

comes up in good light or even bad light
 it makes a healthy sized bush in no time.
 if it comes up under a tree or screen of

bushes (as has happen once in my yard)
 it climbs up whatever is in the way
 of the sunlight and overwhelms it.


8.

so far i've only pulled up one of these
 sites and it was a major battle. me
 standing in the rain. using two shovels

for added leverage. hacking and chopping
 until finally it came up out of the ground.
 then it wasnt an "it" exactly but two

different plants so closely twined that
 it was difficult to tell they were two.
 i was curious about them and wanted

to see what the roots looked like
 so i rinsed them off pretty best as i cd
 and marveled at the number of

roots radiating from each hub in this
one site that was actually two. it also


9.

seemed that there were 3 or maybe
 even 4 types of roots. the big runner
 ones that i'd chased into the neighbor's
 yard. the smaller ones that went out

a foot or two and then popped up
 with a new above-ground plant. the
 very small and still strong web-like
 roots that went everywhere around

the thing. and then the downward
 roots that escaped me by heading
 straight down into hard clay and

finally breaking off after much pulling.
 it seems that most of the people
 that use the term "langpo" these


10.

days are designating something
 like style of writing, or a subgenre.
 and treating it, it's parameters or
 characteristics, something like one

of the justices i believe it was treated
 porn. "i don't know what it is but i
 know it when i see it." (thanks mark
 for that comparison.) and while i can't

quite give up my misgivings and "go
 with it" completely. i know that i also
 can't do anything about it. david antin

wrote to one of the editors of _boundary 2_
 who was trying to throw a lot of heidegger
 at him something to the effect of "just


11.

because, by a trick of the language, we
 can nominalize 'be' does it mean there
 is anything to correspond to the term
 'being'?" (that's not a quote but my best

remembrance) bouncing off that i think
 i'm saying that it might be time to state
 that 'the language poets' don't write
 'language poetry' that they just write poetry.

period. but as i said, that isn't the way
 the tide seems to be turning. i also like
 the idea that perhaps "language poetry"

is being written, but not by the "language
 poets." that is, "language poetry" can only
 be written by someone who thinks that


12.

it is "a" thing, semi-unified and describ-
 able, that one can study and replicate.

i remember reading an interview with
 branford marsalis someplace and the

interviewer said something to him about
 wayne shorter and branford talked a bit

about him but also said that b/c he had
 talked about shorter so much that weird

things happened. his example was playing
 a gig someplace and after the encore

someone came up and knowingly said
 of the last solo he'd played "i can really

hear the influence of wayne in that"
 marsalis notes that the solo in question


13.

was a note for note sonny rollins solo
 that he'd learnt and transcribed himself.
 would that put branford in a most un-
 original position vis sonny rollins ?
 (what about wayne shorter ?) maybe this
 is a bad example as in poetry we don't
 see much note for note copying. maybe

we should see more. i'll have to think
 about that. but what about if it was
 something procedural, say using a
 method like mac low's diastic ? (which
 is available on the web in fully automated
 form --- just add text)   is jackson mac low
 a language poet ?  ignore that question.


14.

wd using his method be like playing his solo ?
 wd it out you in a most unoriginal position
 vis mac low ?  a few years ago i wrote to

mac low and i was all excited about procedures
 and methods and shit like that and i still like
 them but anyway, i'd enthused about using

some method of his to write something and
 his response surprised me he said something
 about how someone using his methods was

writing his poems. i thought that was really
 weird. i still think so. he illustrated it with
 a ref. to john cage who apparently said

something once to jackson about how it
was nice that they did things differently


15.

as that way they didnt "step on each other's
 heels." well, out of respect for his wishes
 i stopped using any of the methods
 that he talked about in _representative works_

(altho i have used the web based diastic
 for various amusements, i always edit after,
 and rarely does it lead towards a poem,
 mostly i just use it to break up emails

from friends or most recently a marketing
 strategy that someone i know had to write)
 but i've never really been able to agree that
 in using his method one was writing his

poem. that doesnt quite work in my head.
but whatever. or not whatever. as it suggests


16.

something else to me that i have difficulty with.
 "the politics of poetic form" --- i'm sort of
 referring to the book of that name but not
 specifically. that is i'm not about to start

quoting or whatever and i havent read
 the whole thing anyway. but the notion itself,
 that poetic forms have, in some discernible
 way a politics; i have a lot of trouble with

that idea. of course much hinges on just
 what you mean by form in this instance.
 bernstein has an essay on pound in _apoetics_
 and it's a very interesting essay and i know

that my buddy mark p. thinks it's one of the
better things written about pound. i read it


17.

when that book first came out and the way
 i recall the argument running was something
 like this: 'pound's form in the cantos is radically
 democratizing and undercuts his own avowed
 politics, and further the poem is multicultural,
 non hierarchical etc.'  now i'm sure that bernstein
 among others wd have something to say

in response to my quick paraphrase. but
 take it for now as *my* take, however partial
 and limited it is, on what he said in that essay
 on the cantos. there is certainly something
 to the observations about the organization
 of the cantos, they do make it rather difficult
 to see any clear hierarchy of values, they do


18.

consequently set any passage on
 a potentially even ground with any other.
 ok. but if every passage were as hateful as
 the most hateful of them ? some *are* kinda bad

right ? bad in that respect, i mean; hateful.
 what wd the politics of a text be that put nothing
 but statements of hatred on even footing with
 other statements of hatred? wd this be

democratizing and non hierarchical in a way
 that wd be worth talking about ?  now in
 saying that, i'm *not* saying that forms are
 vessels empty of ideological attachments

waiting to be filled with whatever. that's just
the other side of coin that i don't care to flip.


19.

as eloquently as the case can be made
 for either side, and it can be made either way,
 i still find that i come out feeling unsatisfied

by it. now maybe this is a characteristic
 of "langpo" (however defined) that it takes
 as given that linguistic form is political

thru and thru. i don't know. it cd be. but then
 i don't really know what "linguistic form" is.
 and i seriously doubt that any two of you

reading this will have the same take on
 what it is either. and so it may be that
 "form" like "langpo" is deserving of scare

quotes. it does seem to me tho that if you
are going to say of anyone that theyre


20.

in an unoriginal position vis langpo or
 to say with a smidge more detail something
 like "the lang poets are probably the best
 am poet/critics of the century, but there is

a tendency to take them entirely on their
 terms & so our inheritance of their work
 -- and all of its possible or most counter-
 intuitive implications-- is diminished.

it's (particularly) presjnar's too simple
 understanding of lang poetry & his very easy
 & uncomplicated adoption of oppositional

terms & the way in which this is manifested
 in his poems-- that i object to." (that's
 jacques debrot again in case there was


21.

any doubt) saying that you've put yrself in a very
 serious position of debt. you owe someone
 some explication of what the hell you think
 "langpo" is and how exactly youve discerned

a person's poetics from stray comments
 and the example of a few poems. jacques
 concludes the post that i took the piece
 above from with the following, "my references

to the "apg" actually reflect my reluctance
 to criticize, by name--or even, in any specific
 terms, the work of-- poets who are not in some
 sense already "established."  even now i am

very reluctant to criticize presjnar's & lowther's
work at length in this venue (though, if i thought


22.

there was any interest i would do it, i suppose,
 in an essay--but would anyone run it?).  but this
 has been, obviously, on my part, an

unsatisfactory inhibition as it seems to have
 spared nobody's feelings." indeed. and while
 i find what jacques says here comprehensible
 it also strikes me as ultra strange in many ways.

it's as if i were to say (or say again, as it happens)
 "jacques debrot is a pedophile. but i don't wish
 to consider any actions that he's taken with

children as he's not an established pedophile"
 and in this instance i think my saying he's
 a pedophile makes a lot more sense than
 his comments about the a.p.g. because he is


23.

at least a unitary being, or at least bounded by
 a body which we name 'jacques debrot' and b/c
 most of us have a pretty clear idea what's involved
 in pedophilia. what cd a criticism without names,
 specific terms or examples be ? shucks y'all
 i dunno... name calling ? where do we go
 from here ? well, i posted to the a.p.g. a few days
 ago and asked that everyone bring work to the next
 weekly meeting and that i wd put this stuff
 together into a care package for jacques. maybe
 he will read it. i don't know. it wd be nice to
 think that he wd but it may be that he won't
 have time. or that he'll feel that it's an imposition.
 but i figure at least he'll have the stuff, that way if he


24.

wants to deal with it in any substantive way, he can.
 one of the assumptions that seems common
 in the poetic environment in the wake of langpo
 (however defined) is that the work of a poet
 embodies a poetic. exactly how do you embody
 a poetic anyway ?  did pound fail at embodying

the poetic his politics' craved ?  if i were to devote
 the time to articulating "My Poetics" is there
 any reason to believe that it wd feel like an
 adequate statement of the poetics you might
 derive from my poetry ? one of the assumptions,
 and perhaps this is a "langpo" trait as well,

that jacques seems to hold is that a poetics
can be gathered from a person's poetry and


25.

that the relations between them are in some
 sense sure. if i said that i had grave doubts
 about that wd i still be a language poet ? when

will i stop writing language poetry ?  (when
 will you stop beating your wife?) i langpo you,
 you langpo me and we all sing "langpo
 langpo lang---po----" by the xmas tree until

the word reveals itself as senseless ?  maybe
 that's another characteristic of "langpo" (but which
 langpo?); the notion that as poets we "let

language speak" or "see what language will do."
 it seems like i've heard that sort of stuff a good
 deal. but rather than chase that let me ask;
 if as i wd contend, i disagree with much


26.

of the criticism of the language poets
 (even when i like it and enjoy it for the

thinking it causes) how is it that i'm *still*
 replicating their poetics ?  and further

afield, how is it that the langpos (whoever
 they are) have been so good at infiltrating

everything such that they can get blamed
 for everything from grade inflation to

the end of poetry ?  how is it that jacques cd,
 seemingly without a wink wink, insinuate

that silliman's comment about the local
 as "important" in his mind was actually

some kind of bid to anaesthetize all the poets
 in their local environs leaving the status quo


27.

(langpo, again) in place, unquestioned,
 dominant ?  and it's not about jacques now, ok ?
 this streak of accusation is all over the place.
 i hear it delivered in such passionate seeming

tones with fair regularity and i just can't get
 my head around it. why does the discussion
 of "langpo" cause so much emotional response
 from so many people ?  "you are!" "no, you are"

"i am not" "you are so" etc. you neednt look
 far for a case in point. i'd really just like a beer.
 is the wide-spread suspicion of all things "langpo"
 an embodied conspiracy poetic of paranoia ?

quick everybody out of the pool ! again, do we need
to rethink the assumption a poetics has even


28.

an unambiguous relation to "its" poetry ? think
 about john cage for a moment (and i choose
 him as i love him and beyond that b/c if there
 are any poets / artists whose work has had
 fundamental and lasting effect on me, such that
 when i'm working i often feel i am 'responding'
 to their work, then john cage is certainly one

of these). are the aims and intentions of john
 cage's poetic reached by his work ? does the
 use of indeterminacy in his score actually leave
 the performer free to respond in the moment
 to "whatever eventuality" ? it's a beautiful idea,
 a wonderful utopian intention and the spirit


29.

of it does, it seems to me, infuse his work...
 but does it work ? i don't think so. i think that
 instead a performer spends a good deal of time

and hopefully discipline to learn a new method
 of scoring and to create music (let's say) in a way
 that is unfamiliar for them initially but which

to perform it well, they must eventually learn
 in much the same way that they wd a complex
 score in standard notation. maybe i'm being

narrow minded about that. but that's the way
 it seems to me. if there is a chance for the
 performer it's in a piece like 4'33" or it's varied

successors. but the effects i've experienced
from dealing with john cage's words and music


30.

and thought, while instilling a certain zen-like
 centeredness in the moment or a flow state
 of sorts have more commonly been flashes
 of insight of a more conceptual nature. reframings
 of what one thinks poetry or music or art, is

or can be.  their relation to "whatever eventuality"
 is oblique in the extreme. or maybe i'm missing it.
 i don't know. all i know is that in my mind
 the articulated aims and the works & scores
 left behind aren't related in anything like

a clear way one to the other. in cage's case,
 and in the best of most cases,. the stuff that

we might want to call "poetics" seems to me
 simply to be poetry. which if we are sure


31.

that a poetics is extractable from poetry
 we cd then again extract a poetics from this
 poetry that was called poetics and if it was
 well done it wd be poetry again and again

we cd extract a poetics and eventually what ?
 we'd get bored ? we'd "figure it out" ? we'd
 feel like we knew the work at the bottom
 (under all the turtles) ?  somebody's mumbling

"go in fear of abstractions" but well come equipped
 with hip waders and there is nothing but swamp
 as far as the eye can see. that's the 'local'

if 'poetics' is the terrain. but with all those
 caveats i do think that we can find, think

about and even construct a poetics, that


32.

it might be easy (like falling down) or it might
 be hard (as in pulling up roots) and that
 it might be useful in thinking about one's

own work or someone else's. but what *use*
 is making pronouncements about the current

scene ?  how about if i go at this another way
 and say that i am a "langpo" imitator ? it's not
 a false statement exactly. that is i was very

turned on when i read bernstein's books
_dark city_ and _content's dream_ and if
 anyone out there has seen my first book

_.1_ then you'll note a poem written there
 dedicated to charles, written as it say
 "fore(&after charles bernstein."  i was never


33.

very bunged up about originality. i wrote
 many imitations of whitman, dickinson,
 creeley, snyder, ginsberg, simic, keats,
 bishop, stein, ashbery, etc etc (the list cd

go on and on,... like this post) and so when
 i was excited about charles' work i wrote
 imitations of charles or tried to at least.
 it's very hard to write like someone else.

you end up learning a lot about what you
 think theyre doing and how theyre doing it
 and you also run right up on all yr own slurs.

i can't see anything wrong with doing this.
 and i didn't stop b/c i'd "outgrown" it as
 a way of working i stopped b/c my slurs



34.

became too numerous, i wasn't able
 to stick with the plan anymore. in short,
 the poems were clearly mine no matter how
 hard i tried to disguise them and so it seemed
 more fruitful to attempt to frustrate this
 by using methods and procedures and

complicated problems to shake them. but
 yr slurs are you, in a big way, and it doesn't
 take long if youve a certain kind
 of discipline about it for the slurs to
 catch up and the surprises and the otherness
 of any particular method to

diminish in the face of them. so
you move on. or at least i've tried to.


35.

and having a chance to meet
 on a weekly basis with mark
 prejsnar starting almost 3 yrs
 ago was an enormous benefit
 to me. then came mike magoo-
 laghan, randy prunty, james
 sanders, dana lustig, rebecca
 hyman, tedd mulholland, maryanne
 del gigante (sadly only by email
 and phone as she's in australia),
 colleen dunne, brian mcgrath,
 karen phillips and most recently
 zac denton.  i.e., the APG. AKA
the "naive and self-aggrandizing."


36.

now i had only been writing poetry
and thinking that "poet" was a thing
i wanted to be (with qualifications
such as 'never admit to it at parties' etc)
for about 2 years when mark and i
hooked up (which now that i think
about it was engineered by charles
bernstein and fredrik hausman... hmm....)
and i don't think either of us thought
about ourselves as a group tho we did
want to find other people to talk to
who cared about poetry. then mark jokingly
called us the atlanta poetry mafia. a name
that perhaps we should have stuck with.


37.

but see, i'd started writing in the
 miserable isolation of southeastern
 kansas (beautiful country i suppose,
 once the bottom of a shallow inland sea)

an hour south by southeast of wichita,
 to which i drove every day to work
 and where for poetic conversation
 i had one friend who i worked with

(anne pelletier) and one customer who
 knew a bit about poetry (albert goldbarth)
 tho the one who gave me subtle nudges initially

and helped me find out about interesting
 stuff was sandy feinstein (work out in xcp
 and some forthcoming i think in fracture).


38.

but the reason, such as it is, for
 this bio-digression is simply to
 contrast my relative isolation
 with the slow build up of the APG to
 its current state. now many folks have
 written encouragements to us since jacques
 started posting stuff about us, perhaps

as one suggested "no publicity is bad publicity."
 but for me there is still a question about
 why it is that people are uncomfortable
 with groups ?  i certainly was in high school.
 i hated and feared much of the football team and
 all the guys who were into hunting (a lot
 of overlap there). and i know many were


39.

made miserable by cliques and stuff like that
 but thru out school until i dropped out i
 maintained a pose of being unaligned, or if
 i was a part of anything i was somehow

vaguely associated with the 1 or 2 other
 punkers in the school (and the schools i
 went to had only 2 or 3 me included). still i never

developed the aversion to the mere idea of
 being in a group, i just didnt want anything to do
 with the ones i knew of. but why do so many of us

seems to fear them ? i'd really like to understand this.
 and why do so many people like big team sports
 vote pro-life, support the death penalty and fear
 groups ?  why is poetry a minor genre ? is it ?


40.

i'd like to think that it isn't actually, but
 that the common understanding of it, the
 common sense of what fits within it's frame
 has been drastically reduced & was
 inadequate to the language art to begin with.

but i'm often optimistic and many arent.

"if somebody walked up and started talking
 a poem at you, how wd you know it was a poem?"

forget the 'fear of groups' thing for a minute &

consider jacques' more recent posting again
 in another light, he writes "i think you are
 probably right though in seeing in my desire
 for an "outside" a buried nostalgia for some


41.

fantasmal objective cultural authority--a feeling i
 definitely want to keep in check--but don't you ever
 feel that way? naively, perhaps, what i had in mind
 was the situation of the visual arts &, more specif-

ically,  i was influenced by the latest artforum in
 which something like 15 art scholars listed their
 favorite exhibitions of the year. now i know about
 all of the corruptions, compromises, etc. etc. in

the artworld, but i was still impressed by the fact
 that there was an audience for contemp visual art
 (which is almost generically experimental) that includes

people as impressive as krauss, and buchloh, and
 foster, and martin jay, and bryson, and jacqueline
 rose, etc. etc.-- but nothing like that for exp poetry."


42.

one of the things that immediately strikes me
 as a difference between exp. poetry and
 contemporary visual art (besides the huge $
 on one side of that seasaw) is that the
 successes of the art world are sustained

and promoted by critics ("something like
 15 art scholars") and while clearly the financial
 differential is part of what makes this the case
 i'm not sure that i wd be at all interested
 in a poetry world where this was the case

to such a glaring degree. contrary to what
 i think it was that tom orange was saying

i don't feel that my (our, apg) reaction to labeling
 was to assert our authenticity. as many folks


43.

pointed out, the apg hasn't been around long
 enough to evolve our own "idea" and i think
 we all acknowledge that we're just taking
 what seems useful and making it up as we go.

rather than authenticity as a counter, i think
 the gripe was with an all too easy labeling,
 and one that i suspect artforum falls into over and
 over, save that in the art world the dominance of

critics and curators is de facto. can we make a
 distinction between the sort of criticism that
 brandishes labels without much attention to the

work and the kind which might as well be called
 engagement, that accepts its limited scope and turns
 uses as much attention as possible resisting the simple fix ?


44.

"...a conversation, shall we have one later ?"
 shall we ask what the connections between us *as* poets
 means to us and our work ? shall we question the notion
 of a group and what it does for and against it's insiders and
 outsiders ? if it does anything much ? shall we inquire
 into the emotional core of the many complex reactions
 to "langpo" ?  shall we investigate the relations of poetries

to "their" poetics ?  shall we wonder how else we might
 frame things so that other, perhaps more useful distinctions
 cd be made ?  i'd be interested to see any of these
 threads picked up and run off looming with.  tho, i
 suspect, before much of that happens, a backlash against
 over long posts. i give. i also suspect that it will take much
 more than 20 hours to get that invader out of the terrain.

CARTO-GRAPHICS:
Bodies of Production, Migration, and Subjectivity

DATE: SATURDAY APRIL 22, 2000

The Department of English at the State University of New York at Albany
invites one page abstracts for our first annual Graduate Student Conference:
"Carto-Graphics: Bodies of Production, Migration, and Subjectivity." We
welcome papers from all intellectual perspectives and traditions, and
encourage participants to consider the trans-disciplinary and extra-academic
dimensions of the conference theme. "Carto-Graphics" arises as a means to
address issues of mapping, representation, and the discursive production of
cultural bodies and spaces. We hope to further examine the plurality of
contexts in which these artifacts--virtual, technical, biological--assume
(and presume) intelligibility.

Possible conference topics are:

* Poetics, Place, and Praxis
* Displacement and Identity in Contemporary Culture
* Expatriates, Exiles, and "Other Communities"
* Creative Geographies/Geography & Literature
* Global Economies, New Industries, Class
* Textual Production and the Future of the Subject
* Space and Meaning in Contemporary Theory
* Cognitive Mapping and Cultural Identities
* Charting Virtual Terrains
* Visual Culture and Nontextual Media
* Travel, Tourism, and Sustainability
* Bio-logics, Ecology, and Cultures of Production
* Dis-ease, Trauma, and Becoming-Cyborg

Deadline for Submissions is February 15, 2000

Please send one page abstracts for panel presentations to:

Carto-Graphics
Graduate Student Conference
University at Albany, SUNY
English Department
Albany, NY 12222

Hi Kominos,

I read your post today on the EPC -- it seems to me that you intended this
post for another list?  At least that's what the last line suggests.

I'm planning on checking out your sites, along with the work of Reiner
Strausser whom you mention.  I'd lke it if you could recommend some sites
that you think are successful in presenting something like "web poetry" --
this is my own preferred term, since as you demonstrate neologisms can be as
confusing or limiting as this rather mundane term.  The drawback with my
term is that most people don't ask me what I mean by that when, in fact,
they should -- they assume I mean posting poems on the web, in which case I
would just call it poetry.  The drawback with "cyberpoetry," it seems to me,
is that a cluster of images come along with it (like mirror shades, virtual
reality gloves and Keanu Reeves) that I try to discourage in my own use of
images in my "web poems."

Anyway, I'm presently working on a short paper and statement on my own work
and others, so would appreciate it if you had any sites that really blew you
away.  At this point, my favorite stuff seems to be European experiments in
Flash and Director, or the more anarchic style of jodi.org, etc. -- i.e.
work not called "poetry" usually.  I have a hard time getting excited by
those too tied to ideas of "dirty concrete" (i.e. exposed technology), but
think it's more useful, at this point, to just go ahead and make beautiful
things.

My own work can be found at www.ubu.com, under Brian Kim Stefans.  The one
to really look at, if your interested, is "The Naif and the Bluebells,"
which is in fifty parts, some 4 or so words long, some with intricate
javascript interfaces, and a few java kinetic poems.

As for why people don't discuss web poetry on the poetics list, it would be
tough to say, but in New York, which is supposed to represent the
"forefront" of poetic English-language activity (at least in that dim old
20th century), is pretty devoid of people dong work in Java, javascript, C++
etc and tying it to poetry.  I don't have any friends here who do this work
(in the poetry community), the only exception being Kenny Goldsmith, who's
more of a visual artist.  I actually think that, as with the Brazilians and
concrete poetry, it will be artists from outside the traditionally main
areas of literary commerce (i.e. not Paris or London or here) who will make
the most invested, impassioned dive into this art.  There are tons of web
designers in New York, obviously, and they make my stuff pretty crude
looking, but I don't sense that there's a general interest in the
"community" for grabbing this toledo by the torontos, and taking it as far
as it can go.  But as far as I'm concerned that's fine -- there are few
enough general authors in common for a general discussion, so a very
specific thing like this might be alienating -- I don't expect anyone else
to program in C++, and I wouldn't myself if I didn't learn BASIC before
puberty (I should have learned basic puberty, I would have been better off).

(I've decided to just post this to the list since it would be great if you
put up some links for us out here on the borders.  I'd also like, for my own
conscience, to know what people DON'T like about web poetry -- a lot is
stinky.  Perhaps you could periodically post things that seem of interest of
you -- that would be a great resource.  I'll try to do the same.)

Brian Eno, by the way, has what I think is a much better term for
"interactive" art, which is "unfinished" art.  "Interactive" art is usually
just something in which you click along a more or less preordained set of
channels until you reach the punchline, etc., whereas "unfinished" is kind
of like a finger-painting set -- you are given a set of tools, a set of
options (in the case of painting, the white page, for the computer any
variety of interfaces -- that's the art for me, the interface), and more or
less whatever you do leads to something called "art" and you can actually
improve at it as you go along.  Imagine a piece of art you could improve at
"interacting" with --  wow, that was the best session with "In Memoriam"
I've ever had!  The trick is not to make it stricly "eye candy," or a
"schizophrenic" hodge podge of more or less useless, superfluous,
spiritually ungratifying options (I can go to Pizza Hut for that).

I suppose you know the Rhizome list and website.  I've only just joined but,
though often very pretentious (but what is "pretentious"?), there seems to
be a different vibe there which hasn't made it into poetry in any way that I
know of yet.

Anyway, liked your post.

Best,
Brian

Subject:      taking dictation from Peter Gizzi
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Frequenters of this space may recall that some time ago Peter Gizzi
published "lonely tylenol," his only, he tells us, palindrome.

Frequenters of the New York Times Book Review may have spotted these lines
quoted in Sunday's edition from a new book of poems by David Lehman, on
opening a bottle of Tylenol:

"it spells lonely backwards with / only the initial T added, signifying /
taxes no doubt."

Now this would be unremarkable, perhaps just a sign of the times, an
indication that poets tend to the same mode of pain relief, were it not for
earlier writings by Lehman (under the influence of Tylenol?).  In
justification of his charge that "some of these self-styled, university
trained experimentalists appear to spend half their time dismantling syntax
and referentiality, and the other half taking dictation directly from
Derrida," Lehman pointed to the fact that Carla Harryman, "a poet who gets
consistently high marks from her 'Language school' colleagues,' had
appropriated several lines from Derrida at the opening of her book _Vice_.

ah well . . .

"PhillyTalks" #15 takes place Tuesday, January 18, 6pm, Writers House
(3805 Locust Walk, Philadelphia). Hope some of you can make it!

Featured in dialogue are the poets Kevin Davies and Diane Ward.

Diane Ward's work has appeared in many magazines including The World,
Ribot, Big ALLIS, Raddle Moon, Tripwire and Crayon. Work has also appeared
in several anthologies including Moving Borders: Three Decades of
Innovative Writing by Women (Talisman), Out of Everywhere: linguistically
innovative poetry by women in North America & UK (Reality Studios),
Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology, and In the American Tree
(National Poetry Foundation). A new book, Portraits & Maps is due out from
ML & NLF in Italy and is a bilingual (Italian & English) edition as well
as a collaboration with Los Angeles visual artist Michael McMillen. She
lives in Santa Monica, California.

Kevin Davies was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia in the waning days of
the Eisenhower administration and lived through Carter, Reagan, and most
of Bush in Vancouver and Toronto. Since late Bush in New York. Formerly a
member of the Kootenay School of Writing Collective. Books include Pause
Button (Tsunami Editions, Vancouver, 1992) and the forthcoming /Comp./
(Edge Books, DC, 2000).

As you might know, "PhillyTalks" invites two poets to begin a dialogue on
each other's work, then have the resulting exchange published in
newsletter form & made available to readers prior to the event. (The
Davies/Ward newsletter is now available by subscription from me at
lcabri@dept.english.upenn.edu.) The poets, following their poetry reading,
informally extend their dialogue. The audience then joins in. A future
newsletter will feature a transcript of the event, as well as written
responses to previous newsletters.

I received a brief report today from someone who attended the MLA
'99 session on "Poetry and the Inauthentic" and was somewhat
surprised to hear what I did.

Brian McHale presented a paper there arguing that the
"inauthenticity" of Doubled Flowering is fundamentally aesthetic in
deed and intent. I was familiar with this paper, having heard it at
another conference. And apparently Charles Bernstein also gave a
talk, arguing that Yasusada constitutes a "punitive" sally, aimed at
shaming politically-correct editors and amounting to an instance of
"White rage".

I'm not asking for a thread of debate on the topic, but I would be
interested in hearing more details from any others who might have
been there, impressions, etc. front or b-c.

thanks,
Kent

Oooh,I second that emotion...all you lucky chumps living in the City go
see Leslie Thonton's work.  What I love about Peggy and Fred is how she
dips in really deep into childhood ritual, desire, into voice and the
compulsion to repeat.  I also want to say that she has a really cool house
with thousands and thousands of books everywhere and a kind of Moroccan
tent and she looks a bit like Amelia Earhart.

Brian,

You might want to take a look at stuff linked from www.m9ndfukc.com, and
anything else by "antiorp," aka =cw4t7abs, the author of that site. It (I'm
guessing from some rhetorical cues that antiorp is probably male, but I'll
respect its wish to remain gender-indeterminate from here on) first came to
my attention as a member of a computer-music list I'm subscribed to, where
its provocations touched off a flame war that led to its banishment

Much of the work is verbally pretty crude (might you guess from the URL?),
and doesn't really fit within "poetry" even as a digitally-altered
category - but the engagement of an "interface poetics," manipulating the
visceral responses to the vocabularies of indecipherable error messages,
nonstandard browser behavior, random redirects, etc., is pretty compelling,
at least as a suggestion for some of the technical lexicon available to such
a practice. Helps if you have good audio capabilities, as, last I checked,
bursts of shrieking noise were a favored tactic. Not sure yet what to do
with =cw4t7abs' habit of adopting some of the thematics of a kind of
techno-fascism in what seems to be an opposition to that politics as a
program - though certainly there's a whole troubled modernist heritage of
that sort of thing, and more recently (probably more relevantly for
=cw4t7abs) the fascisized aesthetic of much anti-fascist punk and industrial
music. There's a Videodrome-ish "become-the-machine" thing going on in this
work that's disquieting, to say the least...

 Anyhow, there's a whole slew of related links, none too conscientiously
updated but still useful, at:

http://re-lab.lv/rezone/a/msg00489.html

It would be a good idea to reboot and run your browser without anything
important up in the background before you surf to any of these pages: even
on a well-equipped and fairly stable system, I've seen a lot of this stuff
cause crashes. Nothing malicious that I know of, but some of it will tax
processing capabilities until you'll have to do a manual restart to get away
from it.

Best,
Taylor Brady

they should -- they assume I mean posting poems on the web, in which case I
would just call it poetry.  The drawback with "cyberpoetry," it seems to me,
is that a cluster of images come along with it (like mirror shades, virtual
reality gloves and Keanu Reeves) that I try to discourage in my own use of
images in my "web poems."

Anyway, I'm presently working on a short paper and statement on my own work
and others, so would appreciate it if you had any sites that really blew you
away.  At this point, my favorite stuff seems to be European experiments in
Flash and Director, or the more anarchic style of jodi.org, etc. -- i.e.
work not called "poetry" usually.  I have a hard time getting excited by
those too tied to ideas of "dirty concrete" (i.e. exposed technology), but
think it's more useful, at this point, to just go ahead and make beautiful
things.

My own work can be found at www.ubu.com, under Brian Kim Stefans.  The one
to really look at, if your interested, is "The Naif and the Bluebells,"
which is in fifty parts, some 4 or so words long, some with intricate
javascript interfaces, and a few java kinetic poems.

As for why people don't discuss web poetry on the poetics list, it would be
tough to say, but in New York, which is supposed to represent the
"forefront" of poetic English-language activity (at least in that dim old
20th century), is pretty devoid of people dong work in Java, javascript, C++
etc and tying it to poetry.  I don't have any friends here who do this work
(in the poetry community), the only exception being Kenny Goldsmith, who's
more of a visual artist.  I actually think that, as with the Brazilians and
concrete poetry, it will be artists from outside the traditionally main
areas of literary commerce (i.e. not Paris or London or here) who will make
the most invested, impassioned dive into this art.  There are tons of web
designers in New York, obviously, and they make my stuff pretty crude
looking, but I don't sense that there's a general interest in the
"community" for grabbing this toledo by the torontos, and taking it as far
as it can go.  But as far as I'm concerned that's fine -- there are few
enough general authors in common for a general discussion, so a very
specific thing like this might be alienating -- I don't expect anyone else
to program in C++, and I wouldn't myself if I didn't learn BASIC before
puberty (I should have learned basic puberty, I would have been better off).

(I've decided to just post this to the list since it would be great if you
put up some links for us out here on the borders.  I'd also like, for my own
conscience, to know what people DON'T like about web poetry -- a lot is
stinky.  Perhaps you could periodically post things that seem of interest of
you -- that would be a great resource.  I'll try to do the same.)

Brian Eno, by the way, has what I think is a much better term for
"interactive" art, which is "unfinished" art.  "Interactive" art is usually
just something in which you click along a more or less preordained set of
channels until you reach the punchline, etc., whereas "unfinished" is kind
of like a finger-painting set -- you are given a set of tools, a set of
options (in the case of painting, the white page, for the computer any
variety of interfaces -- that's the art for me, the interface), and more or
less whatever you do leads to something called "art" and you can actually
improve at it as you go along.  Imagine a piece of art you could improve at
"interacting" with --  wow, that was the best session with "In Memoriam"
I've ever had!  The trick is not to make it stricly "eye candy," or a
"schizophrenic" hodge podge of more or less useless, superfluous,
spiritually ungratifying options (I can go to Pizza Hut for that).

I suppose you know the Rhizome list and website.  I've only just joined but,
though often very pretentious (but what is "pretentious"?), there seems to
be a different vibe there which hasn't made it into poetry in any way that I
know of yet.

Anyway, liked your post.

Best,
Brian

it's great to be mates with a koori
to know a gay man or two
to have five lesbians for dinner
to cook them a vegetable stew

it's a-m-a-z-i-n-g to have your chart done
consult the tarot and the i-ching
to have a therapeutic massage
and give the naturopath a ring

it's sound to be found at the rallies
waving banners and shouting abuse
at the c.i.a.'s involvement
in wars and military coups

it's hip to sip coffee at rhumba's
whilst having an artistic chat
drink pots and pots of earl grey tea
at baker's or the black cat

it's grouse to pronounce spanakopita
the way the greek people do
make houmus at home in the blender
tsatziki and babaganouge

it's great to relate as a person
and not as a woman or man
how dare you assume i'm heterosexual
and hug friends as hard as you can

but who do you see in the mirror
when there's only yourself and you
and who really knows the truth
of the fascist that lives inside you.

sure we all know what political correctness looks like, and some of
us know when a simple apology is much better than defending a bruised
ego.

Sarah Anne Cox and Elizabeth Treadwell
will read new work
& from a new collaboration
at Cody's Books on Telegraph
Berkeley, CA
JANUARY 19, 2000 (next wednesday)

Sarah Anne Cox is the author of _Home of Grammar_ (Double Lucy, 97) and
_definite articles_ (a+bend, 99). Her work has appeared in _Arshile_, _Five
Fingers Review_, and _Mirage_. She is an editor of _Outlet_ mag.

Elizabeth Treadwell is the author of _Populace_ (Avec, 99) and _Eve Doe:
Prior to Landscape_ (a+bend, 99). _Stolen Images of Dymphna_ is forthcoming
from Meow Press. She is an editor of _Outlet_ mag.

---
Ok, I'm reading.
_Outlet 4/5_ is still available, also!
Just sent out a mailing to all those who ordered thru Dec.

And am a new aunt!

Happy 000 all
Elizabeth

ps: I'm reading _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ by Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln.
It's totally millenial and all about oddly found and misplace documents and
Jesus faking his own death. Also it's ALMOST as much of a page turner as
_The Talented Mr. Ripley_, which I am so pleased to have read before Matt Damon.

this is such a complete miscontrual of my post that i find it hard to
believ you actually read it in its entirety.  of course there is prejudice
against irish people --as well as hundreds of years of institutional
oppression and racism, and its traces come out in jokes like the ones we
have read on this list among others.  i never meant to imply that there
wasn't; i just wanted to add the historical dimension.  btw, i think the
joke below is brilliantly metaphysical, reminding me of Groucho Marx's
impassioned avowal of interest to Margaret Dumond, or whatever her name
was:  "Your eyes remind me of you, your hair reminds me of you, etc etc,
everything about you reminds me of you except you."

i tend to think of these types of jokes as somehow, though i can't
articulate it clearly, the ingenious subterfuge of the dispossessed.

Go ask Alice?

Can cynicism be a productive affect? This is the somewhat abstracted
question I hear in Jacques’s last post, which in effect asked, How can
oppositional poetics take new forms when most of the structures available
for bringing about forums for such forms contain some sort of careerist
virus? Kevin Davies says we’re allowed fexibility in the details. Except
don’t ever try and mess with the structure itself, because it will crush
your spine. (It’s in a poem that he says that, too.) Kevin isn’t only or
even at all talking about the structures of the poetry world, of course.
But this is exactly what makes his line relevant to Jacques’s open-ended
question. If Kevin's line is relevant to begin with.

The negativity of the cynical, previously, has been characterized as an
affect of liberal complacency (these last two are words that have come up,
separately and together,  in recent posts by Brian and Jacques): ie,
previously cynicism has not been a productive affect, unlike nihilism.

I’m thinking Jacques must be imagining cynicism as a productive affect
because otherwise, with his associating the reading series, the magazine,
the "small press, etc.", with careerism, he seems to be erasing some of
the basic space and time coordinates of poetry. Where else might it
exist, then? And that sort of erasure and assessment is surely a cynical
move, one furthermore that does not question the erasing act itself.

I haven’t yet read the APG Mirage, nor seen yet Poetics@, two objects of
this recent debate. I am responding as one who has been a reading series
organizer, a magazine editor, and an etcetera. I think you, whoever you
are, would be a fool to think that a career of any sort advances your
poetry -- yes, even a "career" as an organizer, and also, even a career as
poet. I personally feel sometimes that a career especially in the world of
poetry is a serious setback to your own poetry. Although I’ve never
admitted it before, I’ve always been a reluctant organizer, coming in at
the last minute, and have only ever organized out of a sense of sheer
implacable desperation of circumstance (except recently, with the
PhillyTalks). I’d much rather have nothing to do with organizing the
basic space and time coordinates of poetry, and often have had the fantasy
of entirely disconnecting from the poetry worlds in any shape or form,
simply writing from wherever that leads to. . . . Nice fantasy, Robinson
Crusoe! Except he’s not the only model, I guess. It’s like the horror
I felt as a kid when I realized that people were waking up and actually
recreating to the detail exactly what happened the day before, and they
were doing it. The world’s existence seemed nightmarishly
contingent on an accumulation of these acts, but at the same time,
nightmarishly the same for being identical to yesterday.

To even think from a position where a poetry scene can be described as
"swill" strikes me as a kind of weary cynicism more appropriate to the
compromised but economically comfortable existence of a journalist
employed by Warner ("ah, journalism, it’s all just pigswill & porkbarrel")
-- that is, if this journalist once aspired to doing investigative work
for a public sphere. Maybe it’s not that exp. poetry can be read as
easily as the New Yorker, as that the presumptive flex of critical prose
has taken a journalistical turn -- but not, if that is the disciplinary
orientation, an investigative journalistical turn, not even an
investigative journalistical turn as sometimes, very infrequently,
appears, alongside an Ashbery poem, in the pages of the New Yorker.

But I'm really interested in models, or forums, and their space-time
frames, for poetry, the effects of those affective contexts.

Anyway.

Yes, it seems there's lots of unlearning to do in
order to approach poetry on the Web with the gusto
it deserves. I've put together an incomplete but
useful list of annotated links to web poetry at
http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm

komninos, thanx for the link to the 'water' site... again, for those who
haven't had a look yet,

http://workxspace.de/div/water_p.html

i finally have a box fast enough to appreciate such work (!)... i found the
site pretty stunning, in all, an imaginative use of
word/image/sound/graphics...

i believe one of the key issues raised in such artistic fusions (if you
will) is that of collaboration... in fact the 'water' site is itself a
collaboration (one that accounts, it would seem, for transatlantic
distances), as is the mark amerika site you mention in a prior post

http://www.holo-x.com

and this has implications for authorship, our sense of ourselves as
authors-creators (whether as poets, writers, artists)... and of course the
model here has been explored (and exploited!) for most of this century, in
film... which, however auteur-driven, tends to surface the more
collaborative dimensions of producing/creating/distributing...

given the communicative potential of this medium, seems to me that one of
the more hopeful realities of the online world is that it can bring
together various artists even as it  brings together (whether more
peacefully or through outright collision) various arts...

something to chew over, i would think...

best,

joe

I have a pretty decent home computer; 192MB of RAM, DSL line, etc.  I go to the
water site where there's a small brown picture.  I click on it.  "javascript
water()" appears on the status bar.  A second page with a background graphic of
water, a grid, and another title page appears.  The grid is an anomaly:  I don't
think it is supposed to appear.  The window is resized just enough to be annoying
to navigate, but not to full screen.  I click, nothing happens.  Then I double
click.

The first page was a single click -- when was I supposed to learn to double click?
It took me over a minute.  I gave up, then navigated back, since kominos had
asked.  I had time to think:  I do want to figure out the state of this poetry
programming stuff -- for example Christy Sheffield Stanford is soliciting love
poetry projects at trAce & I did all that work for a love poetry class that only
four people signed up for.

A whole bunch of windows showed up before Netscape crashed:  some purple italic
text on a light blue background, very difficult to read, a partial ring of
clickable fuzzy pastel graphics:  a lot of work went into this.

Compared to academic moo environments (I think I recently went to see a moo by ...
Alan Sondheim? recently), something like this could be more appealing to me, with
some type of change from single to double click on page one, and some sort of
testing to see if it works on an average computer.

After that, of course, my personal taste is very anti-pastel.  I started to do a
site for one of my UCLA classes, and ended up picking a "poetic" looking script
font and pictures of clouds and water, since UCLA wanted to appeal to -- oh, I
don't know, people who would like script fonts and pictures of clouds and water, I
supposed -- and I was so disgusted with myself I had to stop.  I'm rambling on
like this because web poetry is aesthetically challenging in a way that
traditional programming and poetry is not, and more like interior design, it seems
to me, subject to the "ooh, that's tacky" reaction.  The way we imagine poetry
could look, or what we see when we read it -- has that been so subject to scrutiny
before?

              i wonder if, rather than assuming that there is a crisis of
complacency in the world / institution / culture of experimental / avant
garde / innovative writing ---- what if,



   rather than that
         judgement            taken as given and then ruthlessly replicated
---- what if, we started with the judgement itself ? ---- it wd seem to me (
and fallibility     is    a    maxim,    i     assure    you) that to make
this call, to say in effect "the state of what's called experimental writing
today is complacent, stagnate, resting on laurels, riding on inertia,
habituated (etc)" --- that to make this call you wd have to read the stuff,
right ? (i'm not headed down



the line which says "but as you can't have read it all you can't make a
total judgement, there is a point in that trail but let's
skip it for now) ---- cd it be i wonder, that instead, that the input data,
all the poems by all us so & sos', wasn't handled as best it cd be ?  that's
perhaps                    it was fitted into a box and capable of being
fitted into a box but not necessarily well fitted to the box ?

                          lots of things besides shoes will fit in a
shoebox, no ? ---- what i am backing around and leading up to all at once is
the idea                     that it might be an over-pervasive and limiting
READING that is causing the seemingly bland taste          and
uneventful terrain more than the poems being considered

        ---- consider
   for a moment derridean deconstruction, as
dazzling as it appeared perhaps at one time, it seems now to somehow a
foregone conclusion, insert text, output deconstructive reading with
fundamental binaries, traces and aporias printed in red for convenience

(now i know that some feel very close to the thinking i've just slighted and
many do interesting things with it, but my point about reading styles wd
stand with any number of other examples.. who, for instance grants, the
freudian talking cure much efficacy ? has anyone had their humors balanced
lately ?)


  ---- now              you might say i've simply shifted things
to the other foot,           maybe ---- all i really have to base this
feeling on
          is that more often than not when i pick up a new magazine, say the
new issue of _ribot_ or the premiere of _zazil_ and when chapbooks arrive in
my mail



i find that i am frequently confronted with something that i don't have any
immediate or habituated reading-response to ---- we're only so creative,
can only get so much done
                  in little time, nevertheless i feel like most of what i
read
deserves an idiosyncratic site-specific reading rather than one that grows
out of a quick note that, indeed, it fits in the old shoebox yet again

I can understand why Kent might be interested in hearing more on this topic
-- I hate to be the one to tell him, but it never happened -- I was there
-- Some other guy appeared instead of Charles Bernstein and read an
obviously faked paper, probably intended precisely to smoke out Kent and
get him on-line ,hungry for details -- The entire affair appeared some
strange stunt indeed -- I actually met somebody in the room who pretended
to be Hank Lazer --

                 last night I had a vision from god who said that the answers to all the
                 questions within this post are to be found within this post and a previous
                 post entitled verbal herpes: simplex syntax
                 I recommend using the sacred
                 methods of the cabala.

                 I am a member of the Cult of The Phoenix previously know as the Keepers of
                 the Secret (see Borges' "Cult of the Phoenix")

                 "whatever else it is, the apg is also an expedient for
                                  attracting attention--that is, for advancing the careers of
                 the poets
                                  associated with it."


                 well
                 jd
                 the assumption above reminds me of a moment in an American
                 Lit. class from several years back

                 during a discussion of the last sections
                 of "leaves of grass" a fellow student busted out with we are all
                 hypocrites and all this and all that and long live whitman (he was responding
                 to whitman's assertion that he contained within him multitudes and contradictions and what
                 not and that he
                 whitman
                 was a hypocrite) it was at this
                 point that I thought of starting the anti-whitman society of non-hypocritical
                 college students
                 not that I don't give whitman great reverence as a poet (the
                 society by focusing on whitman would be a sort of living shrine)
                 but because
                 I disagreed with where whitman's assertions/suggestions led the impressionable
                 I think I disagree with your assumptions concerning the apg
                 as a reflection of a similar logic
(my classmate assumed that because he felt hypocritical
                 and had found this through whitman he too contained multitudes
                 that naturally we all are hypocrites)

if I seem less than articulate at times
it is a sign that iam a member of the cult

                 'an expedient for
                                  attracting attention'
                 in what sense
                 in whose sense
                 in what opinion
                 in your opinion
                 or is there a college of elders hurling down judgements . . .

                 is the apg a tool for attraction
                 I think not
                 at least not for me
                 and this is far more important
                 than what it is to you
                 at least for me

                 the apg may be many things to many of its members
                 for some it may be a facilitator of some kind for various this and thats
                 I really don't know
                 (brandish me as something
                  im an easy target)

                 is the poetics list a means of attracting attention . . .
                 are you being a bit self aggrandizing
                 (I do find it an interesting thought
                 mirrors and labyrinths and all myths)
                 is pursuing a degree at harvard a bit aggrandizing to a career
                 possibly


                 when you first mentioned the apg several months back
                 I back channeled you through john
                 and asked you to make judgements based on
                 Work (I would have done it on the list
                 but I was not yet a member
                 and I still
                 think
                 the only things you've read of mine
                 if indeed you've read them
                 are via the list)
                 YOU have recently commented on some work (sort of)
                 but I notice that there was no mention
                 of two poets in the group
                 Mark and John
                 is there a mystery to solve here


                 hmm, there may be a question of access to work, but I offered then and I will
                 continue to offer you work
                 if you want it . . .

                 But the above is mostly secondary to the grossness of the career motive you
                 mention . . .
                 and the certainty with which you proclaim it

                 (the subjunctive mood-and greek optative-is the hardest to grasp)

                 iam a musician
                 I have not played publicly in several years
                 and have not even played with other musicians in quite a while
                 I could never imaging not playing though
                 I play everyday
                 am I advancing a career in music
                 and if I were to
                 let's say
                 play for the apg one evening
                 which is very possible
                 would I be advancing a
                 career as a musician/poet
                 music is a sort of poetic
                 no?

                 I have a career
                 sort of

                 (at lest a steady income
                  which is why I decided not to go to the
                 university of london to pursue a 'career' in ancient history)

                 and career goals
                 that have nothing to do with poetics
                 I have written poetry since 'bout age 14
                 I threw most of my poems away for
                 several years
                 I think I threw them all away
                 (for the best I think
                 seeing as how I could
                 not spell very well)
                 maybe someone found them in the trash and furthered my career as a poet
                 I will continue to write when I move to California later on in the year
                 would that be considered a "career" move seeing as how maybe ill be
                 closer to San Fran and the scene there
                 if I told you the main reason I am moving to california is to be closer to
                 the mountains to snowboard
                 which is true
                 what would you say

                 I enjoy poetry a great deal
                 I enjoy writing and reading poetry a great deal
                 if others enjoy my company and enjoy or find my work interesting so be it
                 if iam influenced by others whom I share a similar interest so be it

                 if you are furthering you career by pursuing various options
                 great
                 but I urge you to hesitate when you reflect your own insights on other
                 individuals

                 I feel that you may be furthering your own career as a critic
                 I don't know
                 its just a hunch
                 nor do I care if you criticize my work
                 but my associations
                 to criticize a poetic 'association' or 'group'
                 seems perverse or at least strange to me
                 something *I* don't quite
                 understand
  (I look at it this way: it is far more important to me what a member of the cult of the phoenix does than why s/he is a member of the secret cult-'does' in the sense of I WRITE POETRY-or what a nazi does like KILL-does it matter that a nazi hates jews or blacks or etc.-or that he acts on this hatred--does it matter if a poet holds to this or that aesthetic or that s/he writes)

                 iam interested primarily in your opinions concerning the apg
                 (I know that others on the list find your other ideas concerning various this
                 and that's to be probably more interesting
                 and im sure they are)
                 but as I mentioned earlier
                 I ve never considered poetry as possessing an agenda
                 or given much thought to:

                 how an oppositional poetic can take
                          new forms?
                 Or
                         *our* (whose?)
                             pervasive careerism.

                 these are things that don't have much to do with my "poetics"  as I
                 see them
                 which is something else I just don't think much about (it is more of a
                 something I do)

                 (see verbal herpes
                 my naïveness
                 I would suppose
                 im not sure
                 I just don't waist energy on certain topics . . .

                 I don't care for much philosophy
                 though I enjoy
                 Nietzche like I enjoy a good poet)

                 I guess what I want to say
                 if you are going to make comments about the
                 apg it might be best to justify or qualify them
                 (a simple 'in my opinion' may do)
                 you may feel it unnecessary to do so
                 but I sense in your posts an agenda
                 I think you are using the apg as an example for a purpose I can't
                 fathom

                 im sure that you will have some sort of response which I would prefer to be
                 public
                 I feel this is a rather 'public' or societal issue
                 im a very public-self aggrandizing-person
                 I guess
                 I would prefer no back channels 'at least from jd' on these topics
                 I will retain the right to post any mail from jd regarding this post
                 just to keep everything and everyone on the up and up (to be read as a
                 disclaimer
                 not an attack or a personal judgement)

                 my vision implores jd to seriously analyze what ive had to say regarding the
                 apg and his mention of the apg
                 im not sure
                 that there would be anything left --for me-- to say in response

                 using acrostics
                 you might even find the name of god

Those pesky Trained Experimentalists.  Maybe, misusing from memory a line
from "lonely tylenol," it doesn't register with Mr. Lehman that "You are not
alone in your palindrome."  Which reminds me to not limit this to him.
There are many out here whose originality (mode of niche) ain't what she
used to be.  A real headache.

Louis,

Your post has already lead me to consider--and reconsider--the implications
(some intended, and some not) of my earlier note to Poetics.  Which is to
say, that it is challenging in the most *positive* sense.

But the question remains as to the value of *negativity*--or, at least, the
value of the negativity of cynicism.

Cynicism was not what I thought was the dominant tone of my remarks.  Disgust
might be a better description (more on this in a moment).  But I won't back
away from your characterization because 1.  without my having been fully
aware of it, you are right, there is an element of cynicism in my outlook, &
2.  imagining cynicism as being a productive affect is something I think I
have attempted to do.

In an earlier post I alluded to the possibilty of embracing one's symptoms
(an entirely *cynical* strategy of course).  I was thinking, then, about
Warhol and Salle as practical examples of how this might be done.  And,
further back in my mind, was Baudrillard.  Indeed, one of the symptoms of the
contemporary poetry scene is that (as Baudrillard says of society as a whole)
opposites have collapsed--the left & the right, the experimental and the
mainstream, the local and, for example, the (virtually) international (the
Buffalo list being one instance of this).  Since the poetry scene is thus,
practically, a closed system, a Baudrillardian response would be to
counteract the system's equalibrium by moving to extremes--the extremes, say,
of ecstacy, or fascination before the mass cultural products of consumer and
media society.  (As contrasted with the oppositionality of banal theory,
which is fatally tautological.)  Baudrillard would in fact point, as a model,
to the "masses" whom he sees converging towards the potentially disruptive
extremities of the system of signs.

If *I* had the time--and *you* the patience (since I know from my own
experience of reading posts that the longer ones tend to get skimmed) I would
develop this, as a kind of oblique rebuttal, to Charles Bernstein's
fascinating article in _Shark_ 2, "Speed the Movie or Speed the Brand Name."

One poet who I think has begun to write poetry that exemplifies the symptoms
of contemporary culture is Tan Lin (though he himself would probably deny
this was his intention).  Specifically, I have in mind his most recent work,
"Interviews for an Ambient Stylistics," excerpts of which you can find in
_Tripwire 1_ and on the _Boston Book Review_ website.  The poems--all culled
& reworked from mass media sources-- have the form of interviews, and take up
the problem of lying and truthtelling, reproductuion and simulation, the real
and simulacral.  What is remarkable, too, about this work, is that while it
is not at all difficult at the level of the signifier-- a difficulty that has
become, to my mind, badly conventionalized (though, let us hope, not entirely
routinized *yet*)--Lin proposes instead a poetic of "relaxation."  But the
poems--or interviews--offer, by means of seeming transparency of their
language--a new and different kind of difficulty, or resistance.

I promised to talk about disgust--maybe another time--but Louis I was
thinking something along the lines of _Open Letter_ Winter '98, which i know
you know well.  & I am also sorry not to respond--at least now-- to your
perceptive remarks about erasure (though I am dying too) or your more
personal observations about being an organizer (except to say, as much as I
genuinely like the _Philly Talks_ series, it is structured around a kind of
apprentice/master framework (most of the time, the Perelman issue being one
important exception) that does support my earlier contention.

Extended posts, as Henry Gould ironically noted not too long ago on the
sub*sub*list, are for those too lazy to develop their ideas into essays.

I want to second Taylor here - there _are_ a lot of crashes, but nothing
permanent; sometimes the location URL gets pretty strange - and a lot of
things happen there. It's the most exciting work online by and
large. Empty your cache first and I'd empty it afterwards as well.

Odd, have the feeling antiorp is a woman.

"Much of the work is verbally pretty crude (might you guess from the URL?),

and doesn't really fit within "poetry" even as a digitally-altered

category - but the engagement of an "interface poetics," manipulating the

visceral responses to the vocabularies of indecipherable error messages...."

As someone just struggling with the rudimentaries of computers/web, I am
stunned by this proliferation of technical language. (Unlike Taylor, in my
puberty, I was struggling with my bird and the b's). My sense is that
experimentation is being equated with mastery of techniques. I think this is
an error. The opposite is true. Art is created through one's medium's
resistance to one's vision, through some kind of failure of the medium.

Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of art
power creates. In Chinese history, it seems, the ability to read and write
separated the haves from the have-nots. The result: a rulership by scribes,
hierarchy of document handlers and a poetic evolution of infininitesimal
(what is called subtle) variations.


Here is my bit on the ongoing joke debate. First, I found the Irish joke
really funny and hadn't really heard it before. I think, the post should
allow all jokes, including the Jewish, the Black, the Polish, the Irish, the
gay, etc., etc. Did ever a joke exist that was not at somebody's expense?

For a group of poets who put such a stock on experimentation and linguistic
edge, which this list claims to be, I am truly amazed by the number of posts
which contain apologies or requests for apologies or avowals of errors, etc.

With a friend of mine I tried to construct a joke which has no referrable
"butt." My friend thinks it isn't funny; I think it is. What's your opinion?
Here is the joke:

Two cockroaches were walking along together. Suddenly, one of them turned and
stepped on the other one, squashing it. The first one cried, "Jesus, stop it,
what are you doing?" The other said, "Shut up, you are in no position to
talk."

Perhaps we can start a tanka of non-referrable jokes?

Subject:      Questions on the APG
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

[Pardon the overly-careful tone of the following, but I don't want any bombs
going off...]

I've been more or less eavesdropping on the APG discussion here, mostly
because I don't much care what poets think that they themselves are doing
since, while not a "private" matter -- we wouldn't be doing this list if we
thought poetry, its meanings and dissemination were a "private" matter -- it
is a matter that can only be, or is best, described with "private" terms.
That is, however the APG talks among itself, one must assume its a language
that is not general enough to be widely understood -- even if the
terminology is the same, the skids that they talk off of "general"
understanding of them will be, perhaps, their most defining, confusing and
original aspects -- since it operates based on factors that are peculiar to
Atlanta, or the feelings those poets have about their relationship to other
urban poetic entities, historically and geographically (i.e. entities that
either critics have created, such as the "New York School," or that the
poets have created for themselves to foreground questions of locality, such
as "the San Francisco 'front' of the Language School"), their sense of the
history of forms, etc.

However, nonetheless a lot of text is produced by writers associated with
the APG, much of it quite syntactically elegant and carefully composed, but
rarely to I get a sense, in reading it, of what this private language is.
Another way of looking at private is to use this useful term which I found
in the writings of the only philosopher I've talked about on this list (so
I'll skip his name, because I want you to think I'm an interesting guy),
which is "redescriptive."  How is what the APG is doing in terms of poetry
and theory redescriptive?  And if it's not redescriptive, or if there is no
concern with this, then why all the text?  I hope you don't think I mean
that you shouldn't write, or try to work these issues out publicly -- this
would be a first, anyway, a group of poets working out their self-identity
publicly, in a quasi-hostile or critical field, and I'm always in for some
good history -- and quite often what you write is interesting.  But much of
what I read from that corner concerning this issue tends to have a few
qualities which raise an tiny alarm in me, such as 1) high volume, 2)
somewhat undialogic aspect, and 3) self-reflexive, or defensive, in a
"personal" way.  With this last point, I mean only that the undercurrent of
the writing seems to be a justification for the APG calling themselves poets
at all, as opposed to stating claims for particular aesthetic properties
The cumulative effect, in some but not all cases, is that these posts are
more exhibitionastic rather than dialogic (if I am using this last word
correctly) or "promoting dialogue."  There's nothing wrong with that, of
course -- you can't respond to Alan Sondheim's posts either, there's tons of
them, and they don't make any great claims to originality outside of their
abundance (I do think they're original myself, more along the lines of how
"I Love Lucy" is original as comparied to Moliere's originality -- the
effect of the serial, etc.).  But what are the ideas to latch on to in terms
of the question of the APG?  Is there a sort of research being done by this
group that could be of interest to others (such as that of the "Toronto
Research Group" of McCaffery and nichols, which involved a whole new
pantheon of critical figures and terms, and uncovered loads of work that had
been neglected for ages, sort of what Steve McCaffery is continuing to do
now; or the claims Zukofsky made for the objectivists).  Are there political
or philosophical ideas in the APG?  Is there any connection of this writing
to the arts or music scene in Atlanta (outside of the obvious "I like this
stuff")?  Is there any substance to the claim that John Lowther makes
occasionally that there is a larger field of activity called "the language
arts" that poetry (or poetry as it is discussed on this list) is only a
small component of?  One thing that I ask, concerning the work that I have
seen: is there anything in the form that resists the completion or
continuation of the work, or is it possible to just continue writing
consistently and endlessly?  I.e. where is the sense of doubt that so many
poets, such as Valery and Hopkins and Williams, seemed to have about form
that inhibited writing rather than produced it?  Or is this doubt necessary
(Cage might say no), and is that a concept of the APG?

I remember trying to introduce a friend of mine to the writing of Frank
O'Hara at college.  She was all Nietzschean self-creation, Sartrean abysses
of meaning, and more than a touch of the revolutionary (she's now in Cuba, I
think).  She was also a writer, and has had plays performed in New York, and
had worked editorially for Conjunctions.  Anyway, she thought it was the
most facile, idiotic junk she'd ever seen, and couldn't see any sort of
value system in it at all (which is to say no aesthetic quality either, not
that they're synonymous or symbiotically linked in any easy way).  I only
mention this since it seems that "we", being the outside (in this case she
was the outside) mostly spot the negatives before we spot the positives, and
in the cases where there is really no opportunity for positives to make
themselves felt (i.e. rendered invisible by the paradigm), the combined
effect of the negatives is that what you are looking at is facile.  Another
way to phrase it, using the above terms, is that you would like to spot the
resistances in the work since it is that which gives you the first note of
understanding of why a work is "art" and not something like a letter, or a
call in the wild.  I guess  I'm trying to justify Jacques assertions about
the APG's relationship to the language school -- which I think were a bit
crude but not entirely, since forceful rhetoric can be absorbed in ways that
are helpful, I feel, and he's generally a very responsible commentator so I
give him the benefit of the doubt.

I think there are posts that respond to these issues already, I feel, and my
reading of this issue is completely off-the-cuff -- I haven't gone back and
collected pros and cons, backs and forths, etc.  Actually, I just have, and
noticed that Randy Prunty, for example, has posed some meaningful,
well-stated questions to Jacques -- but why all this reliance on Jacques
point of view, and why addresses only to him?  Is it because he's the only
one who seems to particularly care enough to even rag on the APG?  It would
be like me directing all of my comments on "new younger poets" to Ron
Silliman because he made those statements in the Philly Talks -- it would be
a mighty small range of focus to just narrow on his opinions (by this I mean
that Ron's just one person, a considerable one at that, and to his credit
has always, I feel, spoken as "one person" and not faceless authority), and
to always be adopting his descriptive terms to do so.  Another example would
be me to confine my statements on Asian American poetry to the terms
provided by 1) the Asian American critics, and 2) non-readers of this work,
such as all those Yasusada defenders who think Asian Americans are just
uptight and narrow about poetry (I've had many interesting conversations on
this event with "white" poets in which I've felt rather "narrowed.")  I
know, myself, that the terms provided in both cases are often incomplete and
narrow themselves, and hence have taken (or tried to take, I'm a pretty
terrible essayists) up new ones.  If the scale of the discussion is not
there in fact -- i.e. 50 people writing on the APG [including, say, Harold
Bloom, grandma and Benchmark the gardener] -- then maybe it would be
worthwhile imagining it, if only for peace of mind, rather than fixating on
someone else's terms.

Anyway, just some thoughts. (I've been meaning to respond to some other
posts, by the way, such as the one on Australian poetry, but haven't had
time).

By the way, Patrick, I've forwarded those Irish jokes to the director of my
department, who's from Dublin, and now she's not speaking to me!  (Just
kidding.)

Some books
(and yes, I am biased in favor of books)
some books are transparent ice cubes of amusing narrative
in what the French call the invisible style
and they can be terrific, like radio,
with the pictures much better than those on TV.
Some books are high-density constructs, thus more opaque,
and they, too, can be terrific, like Ulysses
or Lunar Baedeker
or unbelievably boring, like certain religious texts.
Those, I think, are the edges,
and most books exist somewhere inbetween.

Subject:      Fatigue and Cynicism
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,

Steve Evans, quotes Peter Gizzi (Sorry, but I don't
know either of these folks) "the heart of poetry is
fatigue" and then adds, "This not only seems, but is,
true--until a poem proves it false."

And I guess I'm thankful that poems are so constantly
proving this false.  In my life, fatigue, rather than
the heart of poetry, feels like the single most
serious obstacle to it.  I can hardly read at night
when I get off work, but at breakfast, it's poetry
time!

Mr. Evans says many other things of course, but I just
wanted to put in my thought about fatigue. A "frisky"
thought?

And of cynicism, I don't know. Louis Cabri asked "Can
cynicism be a productive affect?"  Maybe in life. My
cynicism has probably helped me see through some
bullshit that has come my way. But then I know that
I've missed out on some things on account of being
suspicious and cynical. But cynicism in poetry? It
seems like it would deaden my desire for poetry, just
as it makes the world less luminous, squashing it's
chances. Being cynical don't we have to say, "I know
what that's really about" about most of our world,
never trusting the sparkle that something might have,
surprising you , from the corner of your eye?

Sincerely, Uncynically and Just Awakened,

Marla

I wish that everyone on the list could be as intelligent as David Bromige.
That is how benevolent I feel toward  humankind.

Would you mind saying a little to the list about what you mean by the term
"ideas"? A while back you mentioned the opinion (possibly not yours?) that
there may be a group of younger writers who lack ideas, and in your most
recent post on the Atlantis poetry group, you also said something about
the presence or absence of ideas. What I'm getting from these mentions of
this term is a sort of litmus test for inclusion/exclusion--into and apart
from what, I couldn't say. Since this inclusion/exclusion seems so much
like the mechanism of taste (or judgment?) at work, though, could you also
say something vis a vis possible connections and disjunctures between what
you're calling ideas and what I might call things? (As you know, I myself
would probably have had to report back to the good pediatrician: "No ideas
there either!")

If it turns out that ideas are things, and as such, are part of a
lusciously catalogued consumer culture of their own, vell, vot then?

Ahoy,
Jordan

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 750 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began (at under
100 subscribers). All submissions are reviewed by the moderator
in keeping with the goals of the list, as articulated in this
Welcome Message. We remain committed to this editorial function
as a defining element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news or
activism will also be considered. Other sorts of news or
queries are welcome occasionally; please use "common sense"
when posting and keep in mind that your message, if forwarded,
will be distributed to 750+ persons the world over. Feel free
to query if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the editors regarding
submissions to the list remains confidential and should be
directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate; if
responses are received backchannel and are of interest to the
list (i.e., if they are on topic), we suggest that the posting
subscriber may wish to assemble "highlights" from respondents'
messages to be published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or want to
thank someone for posting something you requested, please send
the request or comment directly to that individual, and not to
the list or to the list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text".
The use of "styled" text or HTML formatting in the body of
messages sent to the list appears not to be compatible with
the Listserv's automatic digest and archive features; as a
result, inclusion of HTML tags disrupts the list archive
and may have a similarly pernicious effect on the digest
form of the list. Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format. Microsoft Outlook
and Netscape Communicator users take note! You may need to
specify "plain text" or "ASCII text" in the outgoing
messages section of your application Preferences. Check
your application's Edit | Preferences or Help menus for
further details.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

To All Supporters of Lori Berenson

This is day 1,507 of wrongful incarceration


               LORI'S HUNGER STRIKE

The Peruvian prison authorities have announced, and the U.S. Embassy has
confirmed, that Lori began a hunger strike on Tuesday morning, January 11th,
the day that we were holding vigils across the country to protest her wrongful
imprisonment.

No one should be surprised that Lori decided to commence a hunger strike on
the 11th of January -- after all, it was the fourth anniversary of her unjust
conviction and sentence to life imprisonment.  She is innocent and this
wrongful act is something that is uppermost in her daily thoughts.

Although the Peruvian media indicated today that Lori made demands upon the
prison system, we want you to know that this is not true.  The written
statement Lori gave to the prison director makes no such demands.  In it she
confirms her commitment to human rights and outlines the violations of
fundamental rights in the Peruvian prison system including complete isolation
and the physical, moral, and psychological destruction of the prisoner.

As Lori's parents, while we are not surprised, we are very anxious about her
health, which is already impaired and undermined by spending these past four
years under extremely harsh and debilitating conditions.  We respect her
courage and her commitment to her beliefs to help the poor, and end injustice
and suffering.

Well, finally a post that I fully understand, but I must ask if Murat
Nemet-Nejat is a representative of one of the first few groups--or any of
the ones he pulled out of the air.  To have left his group out would have
been a perfect example of why it's sometimes a good idea to be "politically
correct."  If he is represented on that list, I'm tempted to offer an
apology, but he would prefer not to receive one.  And "etc." does not
qualify!

"As someone just struggling with the rudimentaries of computers/web, I am
stunned by this proliferation of technical language. (Unlike Taylor, in my
puberty, I was struggling with my bird and the b's)."

Actually, in puberty I struggled with crystal meth and police curfews, along
with the birds and bees you mention - more like fried chicken and
mosquitoes, though, on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Computer and web didn't
surface as issues for me until my unfinished stint in grad school, and then
only in the most irresponsibly amateurish way.

So now that I have my jargon of authenticity in place, maybe I can address
your concerns about my inauthentic jargon in a more substantive manner.
First, it's entirely possible that I just wasn't being clear - I usually
post to the list on my lunch break, and in my rush to send something off,
I've caught myself more than once gravitating too easily toward a kind of
notational shorthand that generates all sorts of misunderstandings. If this
is what happened, I apologize (suspect etiquette though that may be). That
said, I want to make it clear that if I'm not (clear, that is), I might
respond better to a request for clearer writing on the subject than the
quick recourse to an anti-egghead invidious comparison. Hey, just because
I'm a poet it doesn't necessarily follow that I'm a good writer. If it's not
coming across it's not coming across, and I'll be the first in the mea culpa
line. (Which is like a conga line, but rhythm is frowned upon and no one
touches anyone else).

To move on from that, this question of technical language, specialist
knowledge, etc., touches more meaningfully on the question you raise in the
following sentences:

        My sense is that
experimentation is being equated with mastery of techniques. I think this is
an error. The opposite is true. Art is created through one's medium's
resistance to one's vision, through some kind of failure of the medium.

Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of art
power creates.

Let's disregard doubts about that slide from "experimentation" to the more
generalist "art" - I don't think all art is equivalent to experiment, but
I'll certainly confess an interest in what's been described as "experimental
art," and I'd be willing (provisionally) to describe antiorp's project as
such, so it'll work in the present context. Which leaves us with "art is
resistance in the materials," or whatever the precise quote is. And let's
leave aside those instances in which that might (_might_) not be an adequate
description: say, in the case of ambient music, or Tan Lin's writing which
emulates some of its methods. (Thanks for the reminder, Jacques). Certainly
antiorp's project seems, on the face of it, to be about shock, resistances,
grinding gears, etc. And, sure, I Iike William Morris, even if his reliance
on Ruskin's idealization of the Gothic as a jumping-off point in his own
thinking seems a bit dubious as an aesthetics or a politics after the
intervening hundred and thirty or so years. Alternately, I like Kathy Acker,
and your proposal of the value of failure sounds like her "weight-trainer's"
aesthetics, in which she likens one of her writing tactics to lifting, which
isolates a muscle group in order to work it to the point of failure. (Anyone
remember what essay or interview that's from?) Already here, though, the
relationship between mastery and failure gets more complicated, since the
weight trainer's set toward her activity is one of mastery (ideally, at
least) desiring and practicing its own failure. Which would make of mastery,
in some sense, both medium and technique at different moments in such a
practice.

And that perhaps positions us well to consider the antiorp entity's project.
Whatever else you might say about the Internet, as a medium it's fairly
saturated with issues of mastery - hell, of rule outright. From state
sponsorship of its development, to the increasing corporatization (and even,
in my opinion, emergent corporate-statism, i.e., fascism) of many of its
polities, to the complex undergirding of technical, specialist intellectual
labor that maintains a certain inaccessibility in the "how" of its various
(comparartively few, really) interfaces. (I don't want to exaggerate this
inaccessibility - it's true, as you imply, that there's been something of a
generational shift, to the extent that my teenage brother pretty much does
"breathe in" computer operation and web design as part of a normal
public-school ambience. By the same token, though, I wouldn't want to
minimize it - there are a lot of people, perhaps, who learn things like Java
and C++ just for the hell of it, but they sure ain't a majority, even among
computer users, most of whom operate within default systems as a simple
necessity of _getting things done,_ however you want to parse that).

This sense that basic questions of interface and access are shot through
with domination is the background against which antiorp's project emerges.
And I guess for me, the question of whether it's good or bad art hinges on
whether it fulfills, or suggests, even, some means to break through that
scrim of domination, or some way of reconceiving it to give the work a
certain "margin" in which to move. I'm not particularly interested in
whether or not it's art _as such,_ though others might find that a more
compelling question.

This is where my discomfort with the work emerges: antiorp's use of
exaggerated gestures of control, informational secrecy, inflexible defaults,
"the revenge of the technician," etc., etc., is very successful in calling
attention to how such things function on the Internet. At the same time,
they often seem to me hard to distinguish from the "ambient" (that word,
again) characteristics of power and rule that saturate the medium with or
without antiorp's intervention. So is this a breakthrough or a breakdown?

I don't have an answer, and didn't post in the presumption that I'd be
finding one anytime soon. My experience with this work is still very
tentative - comparison would be with certain musics it takes a while to
"hear." Cecil Taylor was disjointed flailing to my 13-year-old ears, but by
18, and at the repeated insistence of a weird uncle, I'd discovered depths
of lyricism there I'd never previously suspected. Hearing Xenakis for the
first time was like getting punched in the head over and over again - now
it's more like the not-quite-unpleasant sensation of a really intense
all-over acupuncture session. Not to be glib about it, but I'm still
processing this work.

So my posting wasn't meant to imply, "Hey, this stuff is where it's at," but
rather "Something is happening here, and you don't know what it is / Do you,
Mr. Jones?" This sense of there being something at stake in the present
tense is operative, for me, in the wonderfully uncertain syntax of your
sentence, quoted above, and here again:

        Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of
art power creates.

Is that inversion?

        Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of
art, power creates.

or hypenation?

        Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of
art-power creates.

Thanks for the questions,
Taylor, aka Mr. Jones

As someone just struggling with the rudimentaries of computers/web, I am
stunned by this proliferation of technical language. (Unlike Taylor, in my
puberty, I was struggling with my bird and the b's). My sense is that
experimentation is being equated with mastery of techniques. I think this is
an error. The opposite is true. Art is created through one's medium's
resistance to one's vision, through some kind of failure of the medium.

Of course, mastery of technique may achieve power, and a certain kind of art
power creates. In Chinese history, it seems, the ability to read and write
separated the haves from the have-nots. The result: a rulership by scribes,
hierarchy of document handlers and a poetic evolution of infininitesimal
(what is called subtle) variations.


Here is my bit on the ongoing joke debate. First, I found the Irish joke
really funny and hadn't really heard it before. I think, the post should
allow all jokes, including the Jewish, the Black, the Polish, the Irish, the
gay, etc., etc. Did ever a joke exist that was not at somebody's expense?

For a group of poets who put such a stock on experimentation and linguistic
edge, which this list claims to be, I am truly amazed by the number of posts
which contain apologies or requests for apologies or avowals of errors, etc.

With a friend of mine I tried to construct a joke which has no referrable
"butt." My friend thinks it isn't funny; I think it is. What's your opinion?
Here is the joke:

Two cockroaches were walking along together. Suddenly, one of them turned
and
stepped on the other one, squashing it. The first one cried, "Jesus, stop
it,
what are you doing?" The other said, "Shut up, you are in no position to
talk."

Perhaps we can start a tanka of non-referrable jokes?

yes and no.  the root of the word "shaman" is "to exhaust or fatigue" --in
the sense of having had to go through something, some liminally and
fundamentally existentially exhausting experience --at the same time, i
agree that fatigue in the sense of being a single working mother etc etc is
prohibitive of the kind of excess energy needed to create what the straight
world calls "art"....

BRIAN
(USING CAPS NOT TO SCREAM
BUT DIFERENTIATE . . . )

                 However, nonetheless a lot of text is produced by writers associated with
                 the APG, much of it quite syntactically elegant and carefully composed, but
                 rarely to I get a sense, in reading it, of what this private language is.
                 Another way of looking at private is to use this useful term which I found
                 in the writings of the only philosopher I've talked about on this list (so
                 I'll skip his name, because I want you to think I'm an interesting guy),
                 which is "redescriptive."  How is what the APG is doing in terms of
                 poetry
                 and theory redescriptive?  And if it's not redescriptive, or if there is no
                 concern with this, then why all the text?
I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT I AM NOT MUCH A PHILOSOPHER AND DON'T TYPICALLY THINK 'PHILOSOPHICLY' ESPECIALLY WHEN I WRITE . . . I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 'REDESCRIPTIVE' AND IF NOT WHY THEN WRITE . . . I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING . . . BUT NOT SURE WHERE IT GOES OR HOW IT APPLIES TO ME OR MY WRITING AND I WOULD PREFER TO DISCUSS HOW IT APPLIES TO ME OR LET'S SAY JOHN AND IT MAY APPLY TO JOHN AND NOT TO ME AND WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE APG?
I hope you don't think I mean
                 that you shouldn't write, or try to work these issues out publicly -- this
                 would be a first, anyway, a group of poets working out their self-identity
                 publicly, in a quasi-hostile or critical field, and I'm always in for some
                 good history -- and quite often what you write is interesting.  But much of
                 what I read from that corner concerning this issue tends to have a few
                 qualities which raise an tiny alarm in me, such as 1) high volume, 2)
                 somewhat undialogic aspect, and 3) self-reflexive, or defensive, in a
                 "personal" way.  With this last point, I mean only that the
                 undercurrent of
                 the writing seems to be a justification for the APG calling themselves poets
                 at all, as opposed to stating claims for particular aesthetic properties
I BELIEVE I CAN ONLY REPLY TO THE LAST POINT OF ALARM:  I WAS HESITANT TO POST MY RESPONSE TO jd BECAUSE I FEEL-AND THIS IS ONLY ME TALKING HERE-THAT JD HAS A PERSONAL PROBLEM TO WORK OUT WITH APG THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE POINTS HE WANTS TO DISCUSS ARE NOT VALID BUT THAT THEY IN THEMSELVES HAVE AN AGENDA I MEAN WHY MENTION THE APG IN THE POST REGARDING CAREERISM HE COULD HAVE MADE A CLEAR POINT WITHOUT "US" THIS SEEMS STRANGE TO ME AND WHY LEAVE OUT JOHN AND MARK WHILE COMMENTING ON MIRAGE?  I WOULD LIKE TO FORCE THESE ISSUES A LITTLE AND MY ONLY CONCERN IS LOOKING LIKE AN ASS DOING IT WHICH I MIGHT HAVE ALREADY DONE . . . BU THEN AGAIN I CAN CONTAIN MULTITUDES

One thing that I ask, concerning the work that I have
                 seen: is there anything in the form that resists the completion or
                 continuation of the work, or is it possible to just continue writing
                 consistently and endlessly?  I.e. where is the sense of doubt that so many
                 poets, such as Valery and Hopkins and Williams, seemed to have about form
                 that inhibited writing rather than produced it?  Or is this doubt necessary
                 (Cage might say no), and is that a concept of the APG?
I STRUGGLE WITH THIS ISSUE AS I STRUGGLE WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE 'ORIGINAL'
I HAVE FOUND THAT THOUGH IM CONCERNED WITH 'FORM' I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND THEREFORE IT DOES NOT INHIBIT MY WRITING JUST AS I DON'T KNOW WHAT 'ORIGINALITY' IS SO I JUST WRITE AND I THINK ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL AND HAVE EXPRESSED MY THOUGHTS ABOUT 'ORIGINALITY' AND 'QUALITY' WITH PEOPLE IN ATLANTA BUT HAVE STRESSED THAT IT DOES NOT INHIBIT ANYTHING IM NOT SURE THAT IT IS NECESSARY EITHER . . . SO ALL I KNOW IS THAT I KNOW NOTHING I SUPPOSE  I DON'T KNOW (AND WASN'T THAT KIND OF SILLY) HOW THIS ALL APPLIES TO THE APG I HOPE TO LET JACQUES FIGURE THAT OUT I GUESS

I guess  I'm trying to justify Jacques assertions about
                 the APG's relationship to the language school -- which I think were a bit
                 crude but not entirely, since forceful rhetoric can be absorbed in ways that
                 are helpful, I feel, and he's generally a very responsible commentator so I
                 give him the benefit of the doubt.
SEE HERE I AM HONESTLY TOO INEXPERIENCED TO COMMENT AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE IS CONFUSION ON WHAT LANGUAGE POETRY IS AND WHO LANGUAGE POETS ARE - I STILL REALLY DON'T KNOW - BUT IF JACQUES HAS A CLEAR VISION THEN LET HIM PROPHECY I GUESS BUT IM NOT SURE WHAT HIS AUTHORITY OR HOW HE OBTAINED AUTHORITY ON THE APG - AND IM NOT BEING IRONICLAL  OR NASTY-BUT DO YOU?

Randy Prunty, for example, has posed some meaningful,
                 well-stated questions to Jacques -- but why all this reliance on Jacques
                 point of view, and why addresses only to him?
I FOR ONE AM WAITING FOR JACQUES RESPONSES TO RANDY AND OTHERS AND AM VERY INTERESTED IN THEM THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I POSTED JACQUES FASCINATES ME . . . I MEAN REALLY WHY MENTION THE APG?  IM STILL CONFUSED?

HELLO PATRICK (AGAIN USING CAPS JUST TO DIFERINTIATE)
 with the length of posts going
                 after Jacques' critique, is seeming more and more like a Mafia. (Hold up,
                 APG, this is a strong statement, but please read this before firing off
                 another missile defense launch.)
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MAFIA ALWAYS WANTED TO BE ITALIAN-IM A JEW THOUGH AND THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN . . .
Mark, Tedd, )ohn, if apg is a loose group
                 with not much of an agenda, why the long defenses of its people, what for
                 the verbose explananda? If you are justified in existing, which you are, can
                 you not accept the criticism of apg for what it is?
SEVERAL THINGS ON MY END HERE I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA WITH THE APG OUTSIDE OF ENJOYING POETRY -DISCUSSION READING WRITING USW - IM NOT SURE THAT I HAVE DEFENDED ITS EXISTENCE THAT IT EXISTS SURE BUT WHAT IS IT - DO YOU KNOW - I ONLY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME - WHICH SEEMS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT IS TO JACQUES - IT DOES NOT SEEM A THING TO ACCEPT CRITICISM - I MEAN IT REALLY ISN'T A THING TO ME - IT IS PEOPLE - A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS I ENJOY SPEDING TIME WITH ON OCCASION AND WRITING WITH ON OCCASION - THAT I AM A CAREERIST SEEMS ABSURD TO ME - SURE I COULD LET IT GO - BUT WHY NOT WRITE ABOUT IT
I would expect that you must understand the positive
                 and negative implications of your efforts.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WHAT IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO MY WRITING WOULD I BE RESPONSIBLE IF IT STARTED A WAR?  I VIEW SOME JACQUES STATEMENTS AS ABSURD IN THEIR APPLICATION TO MYSELF I DON'T FIND THEM NEGATIVE . . . THEY ARE AFTER ALL JUST OPINIONS - AND PARTS OF MY HOPES THAT HE REALIZES THAT THEY ARE JUST OPINIONS
But there is something clear about careerism in
                 general that is a valid sentiment, one that I do agree with Jacques very
                 highly,
YES BUT IS THIS SOMETHING THAT EVERY POET IS-A CAREERIST?
even if it does mean I am treading on being a contradictory human
                 being. (I actually believe we are all hypocrites, and acknowledging our
                 own hypocrisy is the first step towards minimizing hypocrisy.)
AHMEN BROTHER
Some of us have this "romantic fantasy" that
                 poetry is or should be some kind of safe haven from the ugliness of capital
                 culture.
I RESPECT THIS BUT DO NOT SYMPATHISE WITH IT
I believe half-wittedly such a
                 fantasy because such poets and those in love with poetry of such poets
                 will not compromise their love of poetry itself even if it leaves poets and
                 critics with the want of friends or the want of a list of publications.
IM NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH PUBLICAITONS
We are
                 all perhaps a bit careerist just by being on this list.
THIS IS SOMETHING I DON'T THINK ABOUT - I JOINED THE LIST -SOMETIMES IM NOT SURE WHY - ONE IS BECAUSE I KNEW SILLIMAN WAS ON IT AND WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT HE HAD TO WRITE - IVE ONLY READ TONER AND ENJOYED IT A GREAT DEAL - BUT TO JOIN THE LIST WITH THOUGHTS OF ADVANCING A CAREER - I DON'T GET THIS - MAYBEY OTHERS DO - FROM WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ME - AND IM MEAN ME PERSONLALLY - WHATEVER THAT MEANS RIGHT - AM I ADVANCING A CAREER - HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF MY WORK?
But keeping the careerism to a minimum is perhaps a pretty good
                 thing to support.
I THINK THIS SOMETHING I DO
I think Jacques was at least trying to do that, to minimize
                 the stink.
I HAVE PROBLEMS HERE ALSO-IF I WAS A CAREERIST I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT-WHY STINK?-MY PROBLEM IS THAT I DON'T THINK OF HAVING A CAREER IN POETRY-I HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST IN THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST-AMAZING BUT TRUE I GUESS-AND IM FEELING A BIT NAÏVE-AND I THINK THAT SUCKS
A rationalization of careerism in the realm of poetry seems
                 like deciding to deal smack to children just because you know some of
                 these kids will one day take opium anyway. (The APG defense of
                 careerism argument seems of the same logical form. I just use extreme
                 values for my X's and Y's to drive my points home. I hope the logical
                 form is not lost.)
NOPE RIGHT WITH YOU
. The reality of our time is, well, is that there's a
                 power structure here, an _included_ and an _excluded_, as epitomized in
                 part by Henry's removal, epitomized in part by the apg defense of
                 careerism, which seems to me evidence of a will to form a political
                 structure which strikes me as Mafioso mind. Mafia, yes.
WHERE IS THERE A POWER STRUCTURE WHO IS INCLUDED AND EXCLUDED? OH I SEE HENRY-DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HENRY G EXCEPT THAT HE IS NOW GONE AND APPARANTLY WAS A LITTLE TO FORCEFUL WITH HIS WORDS . . .
Some people are powerful in the world
                 of poetry, oftentimes through no efforts of their own to possess that
                 position of power.
I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS ALSO-WHAT IS A DEFINITION OF POWER-AND WHAT IS POWER OVER POETRY-THE ONLY THING THAT WILL STOP ME WRITING IS DEATH-AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME-HAVE YOU READ THE VARIOUS COLLECTIONS OF WRITING-SOME OF THE MOST MOVING FROM CHILDREN--THAT CAME OUT OF THE GHETTOS DURING THE BIG ii-MAYBE THIS POWER APPLIES TO THOSE PURSUING A CAREER IN POETRY-WHAT ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE NOT?
Poetry seems for me at its root _individual expression_,
                 a "damn what other people think about what I'm saying and how I'm
                 saying it."
ALL RIGHT . . .
And the desire to share poetry is contradictory
                 (hypocritical?) on that aspect, at least superficially, but on another aspect
                 poetry is a blessing, a gift of individual expression which demands by its
                 own virtue to be shared.
PREACH ON . . .
But write poetry for
                 yourself, be true to your own passions, even if the expressions of such
                 passions and reasons fly in the face of established aesthetics, even if no
                 one likes the poetry.
WHAT IS AN ESTABLISHED AESTHETIC AND WHY SHOULD IT INFLUENCE ANYONE?
or a reminder that I'm not a poet
                 worthy of the _power and glory_ of such a list.
WHY THIS STATEMENT?
I have looked for mentorship and
                 inspiration and camaraderie. I am young on the poetry scale and feel I
                 have so much to learn about writing, about poetry. Sadly, I have learned
                 on POETICS that mentorship and inspiration and camaraderie are all rare
                 (or nonexistent but oft rumored) stones in a field of rocks.
HMM . . . THAT IS WHAT I GET FROM MY ASSOCIATION WITH THE APG-CAMARADERIE-AND IF YOU MEAN BY MENTORSHIP-EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT POETS AND POETICS-THEN LET IT BE MENTORSHIP--BUT NOT THAT REALLY-ATLANTA IS NOT THE CITY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN MANY ASPECTS IT IS NOT A CITY AT ALL AND THE APG IS VERY MUCH AN ANOMOLY-THERE IS JUST NOT MUCH POETRY IN ATLANTA . . .
Do not try to solicit my
                 response if I am fortunate enough that this has even been read thus far;
                 you will not receive my retort, as I have none.
Hmm AGAIN . . .
"The crowd erupts with a
                 roar!" If I do respond, I pray someone sink me fathoms below, grant me
                 saturated soggy sea-lungs and leave me gill-less in the murk.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SET OF CRABLEGGS SCUTTLING UPON THE OCEAN FLOOR?
I ask that poets share their poetry here as well as
                 their poetics more frequently, and also that our more able poets share
                 their gifts and curses with us here in this space.

AS FOR A POEM -MY NEXT POST WILL BE A POEM I JUST FINISHED--FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH:

i think john lowther's comments to the effect that language poetry is what
language poets write---while on the surface a tautology---is actually one
of the more perceptive observations i've seen on this topic... while it
doesn't exactly unpack what formal attributes may be at work in the work of
this so-named (ever-increasing?) cluster of writers, it suggests that these
writers, once understood as a group (historically, critically), produce
work that is understood as same *poetically*...

i *do* think that one may identify specific poetic attributes of language
poetry-writing (else, a whole lot of valuable formal critique out there
wouldn't, well, work)... at the same time, as i remarked in a prior post,
the critical-creative nexus that seems to have followed the language
poet-writers since their inception as such itself contributes (to put it
mildly) to the reception of said work (whether individually, or as above,
en masse)... little surprise then, right? that as the work spreads out over
time, over region, and through institutions, it will likely sacrifice its
local (ha) cachet to more various readings...

which leads me to this hotly contested controversy over the apg---criticism
of which latter seems to me at this point to be largely a matter of
innuendo... hate to disappoint you critical eyes & ears out there, but i
continue to be nonplussed at remarks which, by design, seem to be putting
apg-ers on the defensive---and there was clearly another way to have begun
what looks now, via brian stefans's recent post, to be simply a "please
clarify your poetics" request... patrick herron's post is doubly confusing
(sorry patrick), in that i didn't hear a defense of "careerism" in the
various apg-ers' response to the charge of careerism (if not "charge," then
insinuation)---rather, i heard an attempt to deny that such & so *were* in
fact careerist in any but the more, uh, titular sense of the latter (i.e.,
epiphenomenally)... which denial would *seem* to have been validated
somewhat by the ensuing jacques/louis exchange on "cynicism" (which term
might be understood differently too)... and as to patrick's comments re
things poetic over and against (i take it) this list:  there's a great line
from the (incredibly macho) flick, _emperor of the north_, "you got the
juice, but not the heart"... sometimes i feel this way about things around
here in general...

but that's another digression...

in any case, re the apg situation, i have an, uhm, idea (i mean, for you
apg-er's), esp. as i've noted that 'apg' appears occasionally hereabouts as
'agp':

why not switch around a few of those letters?... i think "gap" would be
nice, as would "gpa" (i'm a prof, after all)... me, i'd shy away from 'pga'
(not much for golf, yknow)... and of course 'gap' or 'gpa' might suggest a
sublimely parodic oppositional stance vis-a-vis our acronym-infested,
globally commodified, institutionally saturated 'globe of frogs' (which
*was* one of the proposed poetic contortions, no?)...

well anyway, just an idea... barring which, here's another idea:  can we
PLEASE start the apg thread all over again?...

pretty please?...

<<the undercurrent of

Actually, this is exactly the way I feel about *my* own critical writing &
poetry--I can't even justify its existence to myself (which is one reason
I've found all of the posts addressed to me--both back & front channel--a
little ridiculous).

But I've been thinking that, if, in the 1950s, it was supremely  admirable
for O'Hara to have had, as Koch says about him, "a way of feeling and acting
as though being an artist were the most natural thing in the world," today
I'm almost convinced that this is the least sympathetic thing you could say
about someone.  Rather than over-compensating for one's alienation though,  I
think it might be interesting to write out of this feeling.  Poetry, as
Standard Schaefer recently said to me, is always in some way about failure.
& I, myself, am interested in the possibility of exploring stupidity,
boredom, bad taste, etc., etc., as qualities that poetry might creatively
explore.  Brian, I think you yourself do this in "Pretentious Picturea"--a
work I've already mentioned.  Bill Luoma would be someone else--particularly
in "My Trip to New York"--a poem which, besides so blatantly self-promoting
the fact of self-promotion itself finally implodes--is also written in such
an incredibly & wonderfully dumb --yet sophisticated-- way that poetic
"stardom" begins to seem like the most mundane & boring thing imaginable.  Of
the 3 blurbs on the back cover of _Works & Days_, only Ben Friedlander seems
to have a handle on what Luoma is doing--the others compare him to Thoreau
(!) or minimalism and so on--so despite what Alice Notely characterizes as
the book's "readibility" (on the level of the signifier) like Tan Lin's work,
there is also an illegibility on other interpretive levels.

& Louis, perhaps, too, it would be interesting & valuable to explore the
latent possibilities of *disengagement* --but w/ as much creativity as
someone like yourself has brought to your *engagement* in the poetry scene
(the example of Duchamp perhaps? or Valery?).  I mean, I suppose, I've begun
to feel that the word "community" in our discourse is actually *concealing* a
lot of things.

thanks for checking out the suggestion; and so thoroughly.
i'm sorry you had trouble with the mechanics of the poem, because these
bumps in the journey unsettle the immersive power of
multimedia/hypermedia/cyber/poetry, you cannot be drawn into a piece if you
are constantly being reminded of its construction.

i don't think so, placing poetry into cyberspace is making us look at all
aspects of poetry and making me realise that the publishing of poetry onto
paper and organising that into a book, is only one possible way of
actualizing poetry, that there are many other ways of actualizing poetry,
in spoken word performance, on the world wide web, on cd-rom, on records
and videos, in dance and music.
that, in fact, poetry describes a process rather than a product and is more
virtual than actual.

"one of the more hopeful realities of the online world is that it can bring

i would have to agree with these statements joe, as this list can be proof

i'm reading pierre levy, "becoming virtual", plenum press, 1998, at the

Yes. Mezflesque.exe or Mez Mary Anne Breeze, is doing exciting writing
that seems to have in part come out of the net-art linguistic
reconfigurations I saw in cw4t7abs's work (different though) and see
to some extent in some other net art. There's quite a range of that,
from Ted Warnell's work (http://warnell.com); Mark Napier's
(http://potatoland.org); the work at http://hell.com; to Jodi's work
(http://jodi.org); and to Mez's work (anybody have urls for Mez's
work?).

As punk/industrial blares, so does this work glare. And there's a
speed thing that accompanies it as well, quickly changing screen
flashing with text and image through a range of destroyed stuff from
various sources: chopped ASCII computer output through human writing;
political propaganda; the salesman's hype; email... more...quite a
range of concerns. Nothing 'finished' in either sense, usually,
instead an emphasis on a quick stream of juxtapositions and mixing it
all up.

In a sense, this work is familiar from punk and industrial. Jodi has
been the most high profile, I suppose, of these artists. It is in some
sense an extension of punk and industrial. But it introduces science
fiction and the whole mess of the web. It draws intelligently on the
content available on the Web and otherwise digitally toward a deeper
articulation of that sensibility. Not that it's the same sensibility
exactly; we're talking heavy duty geeks here, down and dirty in
javascript and java and video and the whole digital gamut of
programming and image/sound/text manipulation. But it shares in the
high energy of punk and industrial and in fascination and repugnance
with technology and what is done with it. It is loud and proud about
freedom but shares everyone's apprehensions also about what that word
means. It is angrily anti-corporate and well networked. I wonder when
etoys.com realized that they could not have played into etoy.com's
program any better than to try to claim ownership of their domain
name? etoy.com is a very amusing and intelligent net-art
collaboration, but they were never so mobilized and effective as
recently defending their existence against a corporation. Good on
them.

We're talking about people putting themselves passionately at some
risk, 'become the machine' as you point out, in the case of antiorp.
So there's the self-destructive element of punk there also. People
worried not only about what the world is via the machine but what they
themselves are becoming in this full artistic dive into the machine.
Uncertainty about that, at this point, perhaps, as with many of us.
And the emphasis on speed glosses over some of these things.

One thing though. There was a time for poetry when it wasn't clear
that the best minds were pursuing it any more. But with the immersion
of poetry into the digital, and the destruction of the boundaries
between what poetry is, once and for all, and the other arts and
programming and the whole digital culture, the brightest are diving
deeply into poetics of digital culture.

 There's a Videodrome-ish "become-the-machine" thing going on in this
> work that's disquieting, to say the least...

My own work is not particularly net-artish, but I do recognize the
strength of this work.

A DAY FOR BOB COBBING is proposed by Adrian Clarke and Lawrence Upton.
Something along the lines of the 92 celebration for Gilbert Adair is in
mind, with those who wish to making whatever tribute they wish, with an
equal share of the time over quite a long day, and Cobbing asked to poetry
us out at the end of the day

Venue and time to be announced, but early autumn, a little after the man's
80th birthday is envisaged

Ideas etc welcome. Those who are potentially interested in contributing
should let me know so that numbers can be assessed

Cobbing celebrates himself at SVP in July and, on Tuesday 18th, the late
Eric Mottram: Upstairs, Churchills, Mount Pleasant, London WC1 8 p m L5/2.50

Checked out some of antiorp's work. There's a lot of work. Do you have
a few fave URL's you could post of his/her work? I'd be particularly
interested in Director pieces, muddling through it now myself.

Glad you brought this up. I like the sophistication of the coding and
the diversity of media, and I like your linking this with poetry.

Of course, there's all sorts of ways to interpret a "become the
machine" message. Someone as deeply into multi-media as antiorp, or
any artist deeply into the medium they're working in, takes it in, up
as an extension of their being in startling ways. Taking up painting
or the pen in this way is not as challenging to our conception of what
it means to be human as taking up the digital which, as you point out,
has deeply disquieting dimensions...

Regarding Jacques Debrot's recent interesting posts of Dec. 30

As someone who joined this list a year ago, after first skimming
the archives and reading the current daily postings there for a
few months, I can only confirm this.  This was certainly a more
substantive discursive forum in its early days.  By the way,
what is this 'subpoetics' list and how does one join?

> is this merely another example of the incestuous
> critical discourse surrounding alt poetry

Ditto on this.  Often so 'incestuous' that 'critical' ceases to
have any meaning.  I wish we could find a fruitful, incisive
critical discourse that was intolerant of various weaknesses
in poetry and poetics without going for the ad hominem
jugular.  There must be a way to review poetry and build
community that goes beyond the 'critical' puff or blurb so
common in the little mags now, in which nearly every new
chapbook is discussed in an awed whisper or in joyous
whoops.  I for one don't even have time to read the stuff
I want to, that I 'already know' is good -- how can current
review practices help me find new good work?

It doesn't seem the place of poetry, especially a
'linguistically aware' poetry, to propose at all; to borrow
Wittgenstein's Tractatus terms, poetry is probably more
about 'showing' than 'saying'.  But how can we distinguish
between a 'captive' symptomatology and a 'liberatory'
symptomatology?  I think Warhol was mentioned
in this connection.  But is his "I'm just a Brillo box and
that's ok, really" attitude in any sense emblematic of
what we should be doing?

> is in an extremely unoriginal position vis langpo

I don't think the APG, from the little I know of it,
deserves particular censure here; just about all the
'innovative' poetry I run into could be pegged this
way if we want to.  By the way, I'm glad to see John
Lowther's return to the list, whether or not his signoff
was just a feint.

I'm sure we all agree about Vietnam here, but what
is the 'right side' on post-structuralist philosophy?
Were the Language Poets right about its truth? or its
usefulness for poetics? or its being poised to become
the 'acadominant' conceptual straightjacket in
discourse about the arts, poetry, cultural studies, etc?
Some of us may be very sceptical about the worth
of these philosophies while still retaining a serious
interest in experimental writing, including LangPo.
I'll go out on a limb and recommend a book I've only
read some bits of so far: Jacques Bouveresse's
'Rationalite et Cynisme', which unfortunately hasn't
been translated.  He discusses Sloterdijk, Rorty and
Lyotard, among many others, with a critical slant
based on a deep reading of Wittgenstein and Musil (!)

> while it is not at all difficult at the level of the signifier

What would it mean to be 'difficult at the level of the
signifier'?  Hard to determine what the signifier signifies?
That would be 'difficult at the level of the *sign*' in
Saussure's terms.  He doesn't allow much room for a
problematics of signifier-recognition.  (I'd like to see us
take a breather from all this (post-)Saussurian chat and
look at other traditions of thought about signification:
e.g. Frege, Wittgenstein, Kripke, if we want to go to
bed with the philosophers.)

Oh, and on careerism: the notion of a career in
experimental writing is pretty risible; of course one
could try (and this is not illegitimate) to hitch a ride on
an academic career.  There is such a thing as academic
careerism.

Sorry for the length of this, and I've left out a lot of
interesting, provocative stuff that Jacques says.

shrugging off the vestiges of vanguardism, forgetting the pose of
oppositionality, skipping thru the shreds of pervasive cynicism and
laughing at the cliqueishness in the mouthed mantra's of our collective
domination by state, system, theory, language... we find that under this
dross, making (poeisis) is a joy, a now, a spontaneity in points and flows
----- asking anything to be a poetics of such might sound like a request
for orgasm in semaphore ----- but it is uncertain whether the poetics
stated for any making is truly identifiable with the act itself -----
start by dilating;  for poetry read "the language art" (nothing less) and
allow for any intermedial incursion that play discovers ----- for poetics
read "a space within poetry that might overlap with the moment or reflect
it's joy, surprise, delight" ----- for particulars read "that which play
melds with, the flow of language, the crumbs on the table, the corner to
peek around"

I wasn't there either, but my paper on Ern Malley, which was read by the
real Bob Perelman (as far as I know) touched on the issue of anger and the
avant-garde. One of the questions that motivated my thinking about the
Malley hoax (in 1940s Australia) was: why do some people get so angry about
experimental art? This question is very much still with us I think. In the
longer version of this paper I try to draw something out of the comparison
between the rage at Ern Malley and the maximumally promiscuous opennness to
influence of the young New York school poets at exactly the same time. The
Malley moment and its global relations is an indicative one for Australian
(post)modernism; the effects are still faintly visible in the red-shift of
Australian literary culture today.

But I just wanted to add a note here that might interest non-Australian
listers, about the question of authenticity in relation to indigenous
cultural production. There is a great deal of heat at the moment in the
various institutions of art in this country over the 'authenticity' of some
works of Aboriginal art. Rumours about fake paintings by Aboriginal artists
like Ginger Riley, Rover Thomas, Kathleen Petyarre, Turkey Tolson
Tjupurrula and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri (and others) have been reported
in the press and investigated on television. These are all complex
stories,and are mediated by a sensation-hungry media, but one example: an
Adelaide art dealer was charged by police late last year on 19 counts of
criminal deception in relation to Aboriginal paintings. (He pleaded not
guilty and the case won't be heard until later this year.)

The stakes in the art world are of course much higher than in the literary
world, given the much greater and immediate economic value of the
'signature' in visual art, but there have been analogous cases of
indigenous literary fraudists recently too:  the American ex-chiropractor
from Missouri, Marlo Morgan's _Mutant Message Down Under_ (1993) and Wanda
Koolmatrie's 'autobiography' _My Own Sweet Time_ (1994). Morgan admitted
the fakery of her New Age approropriation of Aboriginal knowledge in 1996
and Leon Carmen, a while male Sydney taxi driver admitted to the deception
of 'Wanda Koolmatire', whose book was published by an indigenous publishing
house in Broome, Western Australia. Aboriginal and Islander people have
been very angry about these literary fakes. On the other hand, the anger in
the case of the (alleged) fake paintings seems mostly, though not entirely,
on the side of white art dealers and entrepreneurs. I gather the Yasusada
case was inflected for race too, in crucial and obvious ways. (But not
Sokol?) The Toby Forward/'Rahila Khan'-Virago case of 1987 is probably the
paradigmatic contemporary instance here, but I haven't come across an
analytic account of this one. Whatever, from Ern Malley through to the
faux-Ukrainian Austrralian novelist Helen Demidenko, Australian painting
and writing is starting to look like a good subject for a culture-specific
history of inauthenticity.

greets.

lots of things i hope to get to, but first let me respond to the follow from
brian stefans

"But much of what I read from that corner concerning this issue tends to
have a few qualities which raise an tiny alarm in me, such as 1) high
volume, 2) somewhat undialogic aspect, and 3) self-reflexive, or defensive,
in a "personal" way."

awrightie then of the numbers

1) i am not shouting and have not been

3) granted in part, and for that part i am sorry, perhaps there are those
who can sympathize to some extent with the tendency to take personal remarks
made about oneself --- admittedly this is a weakness that comes from seeing,
or *feeling* rather, that one's work does relate to one's self (and this is
a feeling i have tried for a long time to resist or frustrate or
problematize) --- i will attempt, as best i am able, in the replies i wd
still like to make RE "the language art" and several other interesting
issues raised by brian and others here, to speak from outside any such easy
self-reflexive identification (i will fail, and anyone is welcome to point
this out to me)

re brian's 2nd point, to quote "2) somewhat undialogic aspect"

lemme 1st say that while i recognize the word "dialogic" and the name
bahktin jumps to mind (not the spelling, the spelling i simply hope for), i
still don't know what it means or how its used but brian seems in the boat
and himself offers the idea that something dialogic promote dialogue, ok,
let's go with that...

it seems that perhaps many read my Xonnets posting as being addressed to
jacques (which it wasn't, and says so) and if brian's response can be
extended, as clamping down on the possibility of dialogue

saying i don't see it that way doesn't seem to be very useful and so i'd
like to, as briefly as possible and thus with certain compromises that i am
not entirely comfortable, detail some of the questions in the post which i
thought sufficiently cogent, 'omnidirectional' and relevant to the concerns
of this list so as to provide any number of ways to turn toward engaged
interested discussion

if anyone cares to, they cd look again at the Xonnets post and scroll to the
final section [44] where i revisit many of the questions that i'd hoped
might spark some discussion and add a more, but as many will have deleted or
whatever i'll do my best to recast them below (giving cites in the Xonnets
as well for any interested) ---- many of teh questions are linked and
related and subsequently i've presented them in little bundles below


*       POETIC / POETRY ----- i asked in a variety of ways about the, in my
view, rather facile assumption that an articulated poetic and its poetry (or
is it the other way around? is the symptomatic of the trouble?) can be so
confidently identified with one another [24-25] asked again whether this
assumption deserved greater scrutiny and followed the idea out with an
example, namely john cage [27-28] --- and with another example (myself)
which also highlighted, the "who gets to articulate the poetics?" question
[24] --- discussing mac low and the use of procedures [13-15] i tried to
find an articulated something (perhaps only tangentially a "poetics") that i
saw as clearly related (in some sense) to certain poems and disagreed that
using a method someone else concocted insured that you were replicated their
work (discussion of why i think that is scattered thru out and hinges on the
notion of slurs) --- finally i suggested that what is called 'poetics' might
in fact be poetry, a separate entity not so clearly relatable to "it's
poetry" after all and as such might generate it's own poetic and a regress
of potentially infinite magnitude [30-31]


*       i tried to deal with the by now ubiquitous term "LANGPO" suggesting
that there was in fact a certain amount of difficulty in using it, conflict
even, first offering that if read as "the Language Poets" gave you something
of a roster arbitrarily set by the contents of _in the american tree_ and
possibly also including silliman's lengthy list of who else might have been
included [5] but noted that the tide of usage seems to be turning and that
"langpo" seems to be emerging conceived as "a style of writing, or a
subgenre" [10] ---- i suggested that we might want to problematize the
identification of the roster of poets mentioned above and the presumed
subgenre [11-12] to restate this here (in hopes of makes the edges clear)
{'the language poets' don't write 'language poetry' they write poetry.
"language poetry" is being written (or named?) but only by those who see it
as a subgenre with definite and readily identifiable stylistic traits ---- i
also asked about the "conspiracy" aspect noting that many have expressed
suspicion and distrust of "langpo" (however defined) and i asked why it was
that this feeling was so fraught with emotion [26-27] ---- and echoing the
thread of questions preceding this one i asked how it was that if i don't
agree with much of the theoretical perspective i understand as "langpo" (in
my case that's limited to 4 or 5 of the american tree authors' critical
work) how is it that my work (and potentially many other as well, even as
has been pointed out many times, those with little or no familiarity with
"langpo") is seen as replicating such a poetic [25-26]
        linked to this if not exactly questions, (tho i wd hope they might
provoke some) are my THREE GENERIC CHARACTERISTICS OF "LANGPO" (i mean of
course the emergent usage as stylistic term)
1. that it takes as given the notion that linguistic form is political thru
and thru. [19]
2. that it assumes that the poetry "embodies" a poetic and that such can be
discerned accurately  [24-25]
3. the notion that as poets we "let language speak" or "see what language
will do." [25] essentially an assertion that language has agency of some
kind
        now i might have stated these more clearly as stylistic characters
one might see "in the poem" and not as poetic assumptions (whether outside
or inside) and it is perhaps telling that i do so as it is those who so
blithely assume the linkage between poetry and poetics that i am addressing
(and i think i cd state a fair number of specific tropes that one sees in
what we might call "garden variety langpo" but wd rather leave that for a
future message should a thread develop)


*       THE POLITICS OF POETIC FORM ---- i ref the book of same name and
critique/consider the notion that a politics can in fact be imputed to
"poetic form" [starting at 16] with reference to an essay by bernstein and
express my own dissatisfaction with same (with further commentary clearly
needed) [18-19]


*       the LANGUAGE ART ---- i don't wish to go into this just yet,
preferring to give it a post to itself but in the Xonnets posting the
question is touched on a number of times at varied angles ----- [3, 39, 40
and elsewhere]


*       my thoughts about ORIGINALITY are detailed and illustrated by some
personal history [32-33-34] and i talk a bit about slurs and how/why
recognizing them further affects my take on originality ---- this too is a
topic that is worth coming back to i think and if it comes up i'll probably
try to argue that it *may* be important for individuals to progress in their
work, to push the envelop etc, but that none of us is responsible for the
"state of poetry" or being perpetually at it's "edge" --- that in fact such
an edge is at it's most real, rhetorical


*       i asked and other have also asked for something one might call an
ENGAGED CRITICISM --- this was done negatively [19-20,23] and positively
[43] it's terms described as "engagement, that accepts its limited scope and
uses as much attention as possible resisting the simple fix ?"


that's the end of large threads perhaps altho it leaves the questions, added
at the end, about the nature of groups and communities and institutions
pretty much untouched ---- on that score i'd like to toss out one risable
opinion;  it seems to me that the apparent *need* for an oppositionality and
vanguardist posture in contemporary poetry has become so deeply entwined
with poets in these waters identities that it is ourselves that we end up
opposing ---- ok, so be it, i'm not happy with everything i am either ----
but, when this gets bolstered with theory and directed at others more than
at self i begin to question its use for any of us ---- take for instance the
french sociologist bordieau ("bord-dyoo" whatever) who is justifiably
noteworthy for the depth of his research and originality of his mind, he too
has taken a turn at critiquing his own institution(s), that's all fine by
me, but then he does this thing we might call science where lots of
empirical research gets done and hypotheses are tested the implications of
statistics looked for as opposed to being imposed at the outset, whereas the
tirades against the "poetry world" and "langpo" and so forth in our little
puddle start with the presumption of guilt, may then fit in some anecdotal
evidence and lower the gavel ---- i think it does us all a disservice

     In rather the same way as new movies are now "reviewed" in terms of
their 1st weekend gross, new candidates have become subject to
evaluation by the dimensions of their "war chest." This silly, archaic
expression defines other equally vapid terms like "credibility" and
"electability" and "name recognition," which become subliminally attached
to it.
     In many cases the crude cash-flow measure is as useful in deciding on a
politician as it is in making a choice at the multiplex; you might as
well see the worthless movie that everyone else has seen, or express an
interest in the unbearably light "front runner," so as not to be left out
of the national "conversation." The hidden costs, alas, include a
complete erosion of the critical faculties.
    I am as enthralled as the next person by the sheaves of money assembled
for George Walker Bush. (What did he do to be shorn at birth of his Herbert?)
But I'm even more fascinated by the fact that on June 17 he
signed his 100th death warrant. There was an execution on the day of
his inauguration as governor of Texas, which I don't count, and there has
been one every 2 weeks or so ever since. Part of a governor's job is to
review capital cases: This means that Bush has either (a) been doing
little else but reviewing death sentences or (b) been signing death
warrants as fast as they can be put in front of him.
      This may also be helping him gain some of that much needed "foreign
policy experience" about which the pundits have made the occasional
frown. State officials from the Philippines and Guatemala have been
touring lethal chambers in the United States as part of their research
into improved methods, and according to Amnesty International a Filipino
official was allowed to watch a killing in Texas in 1997. He wouldn't
have had to hang about very long to get this job experience.
     The thorny question of race--always such a minefield for the aspiring
Republican candidate--also gets a workout by this means. Many people
remember the case of Karla Faye Tucker, the born-again pickax-murderess
who showed--at least by the standard of Christian fundamentalism--signs
of having been rehabilitated. Governor Bush snuffed her in February of
last year, over the protests of Pat Robertson and others. But had he
commuted her sentence, he would have been faced with executing a black
woman, Erica Sheppard, who was next in line on the female death row and
had forgone her appeal. Spare a photogenic white girl and then kill a
defiant black one? Better to do away with both and avoid the fuss
altogether. (Sheppard has since recovered her determination to appeal,
and recently took part in a protest against the strip-searching of female
inmates in front of male guards, another feature of the Texas criminal
justice system.)
     Then there's the aspect that touches "communities of faith," or whatever
you choose to call them. Governor Bush has proposed that the social
safety net be maintained by religious charities, and he hopes to make
these points of light his auxiliaries in ending such welfare as we still
know. It's the battiest soup-kitchen scheme since Theodore Roosevelt
discussed handing over American social welfare to the Salvation Army. But
it runs up against a potentially interesting conflict: At least 28 major
religious groups in this country have declared against capital punishment.
Might not now be the time to ask them if they will agree to ladle charity
on behalf of a man who conducts photo-op and opinion-poll executions?
      Some Lone Star cases for your perusal: An open homosexual named Calvin
Burdine was sentenced to death after being given a court-appointed lawyer who
referred to gay men as "queers" and "fairies," and who fell asleep during the
trial. In 1998 2 Texas defendants were executed for crimes committed when
they were 17. (That year, Texas held 27 of the 74
juveniles on death row in the United States.) Both Joseph Cannon and
Robert Carter had suffered head injuries in infancy, had been subject to
lurid physical abuse and tested at an abysmal level for mental
retardation. Their executions violated the accepted international
standard that prohibits the death penalty for the underaged, as well as
the presumption that it is wrong to slay the mentally ill or incompetent.
You probably don't want to know how perfunctory was the presentation of
the state's evidence, how tenth-rate was the performance of the court-
appointed defense or how wretched was the end. (The humane lethal-
injection needle blew out of Joseph Cannon's arm as the "procedure"
began; the witnesses were hurried from the room and then brought back to
view a 2nd and more conclusive try.)
     Perhaps you wonder if capital punishment is unevenly applied, as
respects race and class, in the state of Texas. Wonder no longer. Just read
the Amnesty report Killing With Prejudice: Race and the Death Penalty in the
USA (322 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10001; $6). Finally, the man who is
awaiting execution as I write--Larry Robison--is a paranoid schizophrenic
who, along with his family, asked repeatedly for treatment of his unstable
condition before cracking up. The state that failed him in the
1st instance is now stepping in, at vast expense, to warehouse him on
death row and to snuff him on the taxpayer's dime.
     Yet most people can still mention only 2 things about George Walker
Bush--his extreme opulence and his commitment to "compassionate
conservatism." This is the story, and the media are sticking to it.
Every time I get on the radio or television I mention his assembly-line
execution policy, and every time I do so I get treated as if I had
developed Tourette's syndrome in church. Let that go, and on to the next
question. Yet Bush's addiction to the death cult actually touches every
important aspect of what could be described as his "politics," and
perhaps only the commitment of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Bill Bradley to
the same policy prevents it from surfacing as the "issue" it deserves
to be.

(I'm passing this announcement along for Alex & Kaarla, it's the long
version -- but gives a sense of the cabaret, and more, a taste of the
exciting stuff happening here in Mtl.)

LEGbA

=46ri. Jan. 28th, 2000
Lion D'Or (1676 Ontario East, Montreal, Quebec)
8:00 pm, $6
interdisciplinary cabaret, followed by dance and dj
(admission free after 11:30 pm)

On Friday, January 28th, 2000, Le Lion D'Or (1676 Ontario East) will host
the return of Legba. This sixth episode in a series of events is once again
hosted and produced by those "Legba lassies", Kaarla Sundstrom and Alex
Boutros. Legba is a multidisciplinary, intercultural show that has always
been about creating a space for the circulation of ideas, about providing a
space for diverse genres such as dance, music and spoken word to butt up
against each other, about taking the space to speak to the bizarre, the
profane, the ironic, the hilarious, the tragic, the sacred, the awesome,
and the unjust. Legba is also about spirit, about generating spirit with
food and drink, song, dance and story, collaboration and reciprocity,
respect and sometimes with complete irreverence. In this spirit, Legba
operates as a non-profit enterprise. We aim to give back, to put on a
display of awesome talent, sensual genres, and cultural contingency. And in
so doing we infuse ourselves and our space with spirit. Call it what you
will, new age mumbo jumbo, neo-pagan conglomerations, ancestor worship, on
January 28th, 2000 we is gonna call down some spirit - and revel in it.

Joining us, from Vancouver, at this year's Legba will be Wayde Compton,
reading and ritualizing from his latest book 49th Parallel Psalm (Arsenal
Pulp Press and Advanced Editions, a new imprint edited by Michael Turner,
1999). It is an epic story that spans and disrupts bloodlines, borderlines
and timelines in a moving and eloquent exploration of the migration of
blacks to Canada, from an increasingly racist San Francisco, starting with
the first wave of migration in 1858. 49th Parallel Psalm resonates with
music, rhythm and rhyme, and plays with the legacy of black lit/orature. In
the pages of this incredible text you can find Legba himself wandering.

We are also thrilled to host Makeda Silvera as she visits Montreal to read
from her latest novel, The Revenge of Maria (Press Gang, 2000). Makeda
Silvera is a African-Caribbean novelist, poet and theorist who has been at
the forefront of developing writings of women of colour for over fifteen
years in Canada. She is the founder and managing editor of Sister Vision:
Black Women and Women of Colour Press based in Toronto. She has edited
numerous anthologies, including Piece of My Heart, an anthology of writings
by lesbians of colour. Her own texts include, Silenced, an ethnographic
collection of the oral histories of Caribbean domestic workers in Canada
and Growing up Black, a resource guide for youth. She has also authored two
collections of short stories, Remembering G and Other Stories (Sister
Vision Press, 1991) and Her Head a Village (1994 Press Gang). The Revenge
of Maria is a beautiful and detailed novel which explores how memories and
secrets are carried down generations. Moving between North American and
Jamaica the novel starts with an ending as Maria, a powerful and deeply
bitter matriarch, dies suddenly. From this, the novel moves back and forth
in time, mapping out Maria's legacy in the narratives of the three
generations who have descended from her. Each generation confronts the
unraveling of this family legacy with the possibility of weaving new
connections, and new stories.

Motion is a hiphop artist, mc, and radio host extraordinaire who will also
be joining us from Toronto. She strings words together in a complex blend
of rhythm and rhyme, and her work explores issues of social justice. From
Montreal, Legba will play host to Nah-ee-lah. Fresh from a performance in
Brooklyn, New York at Nkiru Books, Naila Belvett is back writing and
performing in Montreal. Last spring, Naila and Debbie Young wrote,
produced, directed and starred in Yagayah: two, womyn, black, griots.
Currently this two womyn play is one of three scripts featured in Black
Theatre Workshop's The Next Stage Series. Debbie is herself just back from
a stay in New York where she performed to much acclaim at the famed
Nuyorican Poets Cafe as well as a host of other venues. Debbie, born and
partially bred in Jamaica, is a self-styled dramatist and poet whose work
marries such diverse genres as dramatic monologue and dub poetry into a
unique form and a riveting performance.

In amongst this plethora of words we hope to weave song and dance. To this
end we will be joined by the Diviners (Danielle Desormeaux, Dina Rizkalla,
Katherine Cram, Janey Element, and Beverly Walker), a sensational a
cappella quintet which has been performing in and around Montreal since
1996. This group fuses traditional and gospel musical styles into exiting
interpretations of music from around the world. It is hard to stay still
when listening to them. And this is equally true of Ellementale - 5 (Lynk,
Snakey, Short Circuit, Silk Soul, and Twinkle Toes), a vibrant five person
breakdancing group who have gained enormous popularity with their numerous
performances in the Montreal area. And if you really feel like dancing,
they give lessons too. Also dancing will be the damsels in drag, Mary Ann
Lacey, Alyson Vishnovska, and Cat Lipskomb who will be performing the
humorous Marlene =E0 Trois, choreographed by Mary Ann Lacey, and accompanied
by Annabelle Chvosteck. This laugh out loud piece plays on ideas of
sexuality and plurality to the tune of About Falling in Love Again, by
Marlene Deitriech. Annabelle, just back from Japan, will be joining us in
her own right as the exceptional singer/songwriter she is. And to keep you
moving Becky Foon (cello) and Scott Russell (buckets) will start of the
midnight revelry with a bevy of beats. And to make sure that the energy and
spirit generated by this epic event does not dissipate in the cold night
air of January, Legba is hosting a dance after the show, with dj Mim (Moew
Mixx and more) to keep us moving.

And then there is us. There exists no definition that facilitates the
delineation of spoken word and music. The spoken word is musical and the
cadences of language harbour infinite melodies. Without backing band, beat
box or synthesizer, Alex Boutros and Kaarla Sundstrom sound music by
orchestrating poetry, exploring and exploiting the melodies that occur when
two voices collide and elide.

Sound good? Contact us at email, legb_a@hotmail.com.

Thanks, in advance, for your support.

Yes it is, I believe from New Directions.  I forget the translator's name at
the moment, I'm sure I'll remember when I get home from work.  An early (and
relatively long) example of the prose poem-- in French or any other
language.  Was a big influence on the surrealists, and though (to moi, at
least) it now seems a bit dated, it's definitely worth checking out.

C.C. Wang: Recent Works
Opening reception Jan. 20th 6-8

    Ethan Cohen Fine Arts presents C.C. Wang's recent ink paintings. Mr.
Wang's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art emphasizes his role as a
collector. Our show focuses on C.C. Wang the painter.  We see the product of
years of meticulous study and the influences of Chinese Landscape painting
and calligraphy in addition to Western abstract expressionism. These works
are both complex and pure of line, demonstrating Wang's mastery over the
medium and the wisdom in his technique. They demonstrate Wang's "brushvoice."
    Today, at 92, C.C. Wang remains a vibrant link between Chinese
traditional and contemporary art. Mr. Wnag first studied Chinese painting in
the early part of this century under master Wu Hufan. After the Communist
revolution, he moved to New York and immediately involved himself in the art
world. His love for Modernism, East and West, as well as Literati painting
has enabled his works to merge the Chinese and Western traditions.

VIRTUAL STATES: The Internet and the Boundaries of the Nation-State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Author: Jerry Everard
Publisher: Routledge London and NY
Year of publication: 2000 (now available)
ISBN: 0-415-17214-4 (pbk)

VIRTUAL STATES challenges the idea that the nation-state is dead. In
all the hype about the Internet, little thought has been given to the
systematic inequalities being brought about by globalisation, and
exacerbated by the global spread of the Internet. Jerry Everard argues
that new disparities are emerging between the information 'haves' and the
information 'have-nots'; between wealthy and poor states; and between the
wealthy and poor in wealthy states. VIRTUAL STATES systematically
addresses these inequalities.

The book argues that there are two economies embodied in nation-states:
the goods and services economy, and the identity economy. While the
state's role in the first may be diminishing, its role in the latter is
stronger than ever. In today's climate of change and uncertainty, people
are turning to nationalism and engaging in regional conflicts over
identity. Jerry Everard suggests that identity is the outcome of
boundary-making processes: ways of identifying self from other; 'us' from
'them'. The Internet's ability to cross borders with impunity challenges
traditional, state-based identity structures. What is needed, he argues,
is a theoretical framework within which states can be disaggregated into
multiple sets of identities. This book provides just such a framework.

Structured in four parts, with detailed chapter summaries, VIRTUAL STATES
presents a compact and accessible theoretical and historical introduction
to the Internet, its relationship to the developing world, the Internet in
relation to the developed world and the Internet and society. The book
also covers such issues as war, censorship and the philosophical
implications of hypertext, which is at the heart of the Net. Written for
the general reader, this book is also a core resource for those interested
in the implictions of the Internet in international relations, cultural
studies and international political economy.

JERRY EVERARD is in the Department of English and Theatre Studies at the
Australian National University.

i'm guesting as editor of a poetics issuse of the online magazine
perforation (which you can access thru the larger public domain site
http://www.pd.org/) --- the call for work hasn't been posted yet but should
appear sometime soon --- submissions can either come to me at
jlowther@facstaff.oglethorpe.edu or to robert cheatham at zeug@noel.pd.org
(tho he will just forward to me) --- the theme follows



POETICS : PLAY : PARTICULARS

joy, surprise, delight ----- desire found in its satisfaction -----
shrugging off the vestiges of vanguardism, forgetting the pose of
oppositionality, skipping thru the shreds of pervasive cynicism and laughing
at the cliqueishness in the mouthed mantra's of our collective domination by
state, system, theory, language... we find that under this dross, making
(poeisis) is a joy, a now, a spontaneity in points and flows ----- asking
anything to be a poetics of such might sound like a request for orgasm in
semaphore ----- but it is uncertain whether the poetics stated for any
making is truly identifiable with the act itself ----- start by dilating;
for poetry read "the language art" (nothing less) and allow for any
intermedial incursion that play discovers ----- for poetics read "a space
within poetry that might overlap with the moment or reflect it's joy,
surprise, delight"; for particulars read "that which play melds with, the
flow of language, the crumbs on the table, the corner to peek around"

Subject:      Re: Questions on the APG
Comments: To: bstefans@RANDOMHOUSE.COM
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

     All:

     I've been relatively quiet on this issue, aside from several
     respectful conversations backchannel with Jacques, Patrick
     and others.

     Please understand that when Mark or John choose to post to the List,
     they are doing so only speaking for themselves.  I think a lot of the
     commentary on the subject of "the APG" really has to do more with how
     the APG has been viewed based upon postings from mainly two people
     than it does with the APG as an actual group of individual people.

     I'm going to give my take on some of the questions Brian asked
     regarding the APG:

     The APG does not have an agenda--other than providing an opportunity
     for people interested in poetry and poetics (other than the usual
     Southern narrative poetry that is prevalent in Atlanta) to get
     together to discuss same, share what they've written, work on some
     ocassional collaborative works, and try to get stuff published.
     Perhaps the problem from the beginning was that since the APG defined
     itself as a "group" it allowed for others to assume that we were
     grouping because we had a shared (1) private language; (2) politic;
     (3) aesthetic approach, and; (4) careerist plan.

     Now, I was not there from the beginning when it was decided somehow
     that this bunch of people would call themselves something.  When I met
     up with John and Randy all they told me was that they and a few other
     people meet weekly to talk about poetry, etc. and would I be interested
     in stopping by?  There was no agenda, no sales pitch, no 12 step
     program--just "this is the poetry that we're into."  Sort of like the
     idea for starting the List I'm posting to right now.  A community of
     people interested in similar ideas about/works of poetry and poetics.

     As to political or philosophical ideas...well, those vary with
     everyone, and none have become our defining motive(s) for talking
     about poetics or writing poetry.

     Nope, no real hook ups with the arts/music scene in Atlanta, although
     some of us know people who are doing things around town.  (Hell, my
     only connection with the music scene here is I've got some musician
     friends who have toured with/partied with bands like the Black Crowes,
     but I don't think that's what you're looking for, eh?) Is it necessary
     or will it somehow "validate" us if we're somehow aligned with those
     in the art/music scene?  And, really, who cares?  If we align
     ourselves with the happenin' people on the scene, doesn't that make us
     careerist in our intent?  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

     Now, what has become increasingly clear to me is the use of the name
     "APG" is problematic to the theorists on this List because of the
     unspoken implications of naming, and ties to/breaks with historical
     groupings that have become named.  Also problematic is calling
     attention to said named group because it calls motive into question.
     Well, I don't necessarily disagree with any of you on these points
     because theoretically I understand what arguments you're trying to
     make.  But, if you're saying it's wrong or problematic, then propose a
     different solution.  A simple one could be that the group of people in
     Atlanta who meet once a week and talk about/share poetry not ever call
     themselves "APG" again.  Does that really change the fact about what
     these people in Atlanta do/don't do, or does that just make everyone
     else more comfortable?

     I am so disheartened by the lack of consideration some on this List
     have chosen to perpetuate against others of their "community."  (This
     is not only in reference to this whole APG fiasco.)  I am weary of
     having to defend myself and my friends (or take issue with my friends
     when I feel that they are increasing the agitation further--as Mark
     has said, we all disagree often) for the right to be present in this
     "community" as a poet.  I strongly agree with John's post yesterday
     where he says, "it seems to me that the apparent *need* for an
     oppositionality and vanguardist posture in contemporary poetry has
     become so deeply entwined with poets in these waters identities that
     it is ourselves that we end up opposing ... but, when this gets
     bolstered with theory and directed at others more than at self i begin
     to question its use for any of us."  As a "community" of people
     interested in experimental poetry/poetics (and a somewhat
     self-marginalized group, no less) it seems it would behoove us to try
     to seek out our commonalities and sense of understanding of one
     another than to try to subdivide and marginalize further.

     Peace,

     Dana

Hi Folks,

I only have a few moments, but I wanted to clarify certain aspects of my
approach to this APG thing, which is obviously wearying many people.

My hope was to put across the idea that a group of poets need not define
themselves along the terms that anyone else sets out for them, nor that they
need define themselves at all.  This was why I described the whole situation
with O'Hara, and the apparent perception of "positives" before "negatives,"
etc. etc.  What I wrote about the music scene, for example, wasn't intended
to suggest to these poets that, were they to write about music in Atlanta,
they would be legitimized as a group -- it was just a concrete example,
better than a term like "how do they represent the 'local'".  I think my
mention of the "private language" was misinterpreted -- I'm not quite sure
how it was interpreted, but all I meant was that rather mundane, but
probably idiosyncratic, language that many of us use in casual or not-so
casual face-to-face conversation, in bars or in homes (many poets in
response to my post have specified, for example, that they have not "agenda"
in their meetings -- this is an example, itself, of an element of this
"private language" -- it seems to be a common element to many of these poets
that they have "no agenda", a term that means something specific in their
context).  I think this language -- just like, say, the language of the
Beats -- can be used in critical writing or poetics writing to suggest
unique values, but it doesn't have to be.  I wasn't suggesting much more
than that.   I wasn't suggesting that the APG had to have a politics (though
to have "no agenda" is to have a politics, I feel), nor a common aesthetic
approach.

I thought, in fact, that the point of my post was that the poets concerned
need not use any of the terminology that is mostly taken for granted on this
list and elsewhere, by myself and others, when talking about issues of
contemporary poetics.  We use this terminology because we are pretty sure
that it's been adopted by a wide group of people (were their more Iranians
and Taiwanese, for example, we could not make this assumption, but we do),
more than have adopted the word "skanky" as a critical term for describing a
poem (for example), though we consign it to scare quotes anyway.  This is
exactly, I feel, what Dana meant when quoting John:

> I strongly agree with John's post yesterday where he says, "it seems to me
that the apparent *need* for an oppositionality and vanguardist posture in
contemporary poetry has become so deeply entwined with poets in these waters
identities that it is ourselves that we end up opposing ... but, when this
gets bolstered with theory and directed at others more than at self i begin
to question its use for any of us."

I guess I was looking to the "APG" to make a move in trying to get past any
of the given terminology -- "oppositionality," "marginality," the
"avant-garde," the "local," any of the terms which are proving themselves
not very useful anymore -- and so was being a little pushy.  I would like to
get away from these terms myself, but need the content for the new terms.
What I have heard from these poets seems to suggest to me that there is
little desire to do more than not "share an agenda," which is fine with me
-- it's obviously a position itself, of sorts, and, were it to be tested and
stuck to, will produce a new way of thinking.  Imagining the "not sharing an
agenda" as the paradigm, it will no doubt push itself toward something very
different.

Consequently, I never suggested in my post that there was anything like
"careerism" involved -- it's not quite right to mix that terminology with my
own.  I couldn't care less about "careerism" -- it would be like suggesting
that Olson wrote "Projective Verse" because he was interested in a "career"
in poetry (or Hopkins wrote his diaries on "parnassian" verse, or Rimbaud
wrote his "Letter of the Seer") because of careerism.  I think these poets
were interested in an "idea," which, concerning another post, I will try to
address later, though I feel it's probably kind of boring to most people
now.

But concerning that post that suggests that I think poets should have
"ideas" because of some idea of "exclusion/inclusion" which involves a
"litmus test," this seems to me a forced reading of what I have been writing
for the past several weeks, on the APG or not, since all I have written
about is to suggest that a new language for describing things would collapse
any sort of outside/inside, and would have no judges to decide its relative
virtues, only the people actively concerned to suggest improvements (they
would be only people who would care to suggest improvements).  It would be a
project in flux, in motion, nothign settled, no criteria.  This is the power
of the concept of "redescription" -- you can't hear it until it happens, but
when it happens (such as "the verse that print bred" and the "page as an
open field" in Olson's writing) you know it happens -- the "whole area is
lifted," which is what Williams wrote of Olson's essays (or something like
that).  The same with ideas: if you've never had an idea, you are probably
going to be confused when someone suggests that a good idea would make
things different right now.  If you equate ideas with "that thing that those
other 'included' people have" and equate it with the language that "they"
use, you will be hard put to find your own ideas because the language you
are using to find them (your "private language") is not their language, not
recognized by them.  "Exclusion" is practically implicit in having an idea
(the reverse of what you were suggesting, Jordan).  O'Hara's ideas in
"Personism," for example, would not have been recognized by the New Critics,
partly because the terminology "going on your nerve" would have no content
for them, but any close reading of this text shows that it is filled with
ideas.  If one is stuck on the idea of a "litmus test," that probably means
that one's ideas have suffered greatly because of someone else's judgment --
that the litmus test proved one's ideas false, "unworthy."  But most likely
this litmus test is just the barriers between different versions of
"private" languages (languages that are masquerading as the final, permanent
one) and most likely it is you, not the evil doctor, who is holding the
urine stick (one kind of litmus test).

I do think poets today have ideas, of course, I was being flip and pushy
with that one line.

> Now, what has become increasingly clear to me is the use of the name "APG"
is problematic to the theorists on this List because of the unspoken
implications of naming, and ties to/breaks with historical groupings that
have become named.  Also problematic is calling attention to said named
group because it calls motive into question.  Well, I don't necessarily
disagree with any of you on these points because theoretically I understand
what arguments you're trying to make.  But, if you're saying it's wrong or
problematic, then propose a different solution.

I was suggesting that different solutions were possible.  But anyway, the
subject of "naming" is one of the great philosophical questions, but has a
everyday basis, too.  (Go to Montreal -- the government is constantly trying
to keep new words out of the language, good words like "spermicelli.")
Think of how you stuttered the first time you used the term "email," how you
spoke it with a slight grimace, how you thought it less substatial than a
"letter" or a "poem" even.  It seemed dirty and mundane (at least it did to
me).  But after a while "reality" sets in, or experience suggests the
solidity of the category, the content for this word fills in, and it takes
on substance -- it's "naturalized".  Perhaps this is what is happening with
the name "APG" -- it's being said with a stutter.  Doesn't mean it's a bad
term.

Anyway, apologies if my previous posting was a total misfire.  You can shut
off your TV now, and at any time, and think.

Cheers,
Brian

What does bother me about the work is the modernist medium as message
slant to a lot of it; the content is in the coding, in what it does on
one's screen. With the MOO stuff or talker stuff or lpmud or programming
stuff I (and others) have done, there's a working of psychological content
in that I find too often missing. I love the machinic aspect of antiorp
and others for that matter, but, at least for the past couple of years, it
remains oddly reminiscent of, say, russian futurist design and yes, punk/
industrial as you say. On the other hand, the fact that the work digs so
deep into protocols is incredibly exciting - Alan

Parables


One day Nikuko was walking by the banks of a raging river. She was reading
the Diamond Sutra, and stepped dangerously near the shoreline. A passing
monk came up to her and said, Please be careful, or you will drown. Nikuko
said, The Diamond Sutra will save me. The monk said, The Diamond Sutra has
never saved anyone. He grabbed the scroll from her and threw it in the
river. Nikuko, furious, jumped in after it, and with much difficulty
brought it back to shore. The monk said, On the other hand, everyone saves
the Diamond Sutra.


There once was a lion who terrorized the villages of southern Kyushu.
Nikuko was walking near Kirishimayama one day, hoping for enlightenment.
The more she hoped, the farther she walked, and the farther she walked,
the more hopeless her condition. Mired in emotion, she vanquished the lion
in a dreamlike state from which she never recovered. Now enlightened, she
continued her terrorization of the villages, plundering, raping, and mur-
dering, without cause, with great effect. She knew there were no lions.


It was Hokkaido's darkest winter in a long time. Outside, the ground was
frozen. Nikuko sat by a fire inside the thatched hut; covered with skins,
she chanted Amida, slowly drinking tea. Her eyes were half open, her child
asleep in the corner. The wind howled; the flickering flames made eerie
patterns on the wall. But there was something else in the wind and the
snow, something not quite right with the night. Something was shuffling
around the hut, and, if she tried, she heard great wings beating. She was
certain it was a tengu, come to disturb her meditation. Nikuko felt a
great sleep come over her, her body covered by wings, not skins. She woke
in the early dawn; there were wings everywhere upon her, her muscles thick
within them. Nikuko moved the wings in great swatches; they beat in all
directions, and she remained immobilized. Her child had vanished. She
could no longer chant, could no longer speak. She huddled there, the fire
cold, beating her wings, again and again. The walls of the hut were over-
come, her soul was overcome. She continued beating. She beat the air into
clouds, beat the winter sun back in the sky. The day dawned warmer and
warmer; Nikuko, exhausted, fell back down into a deep sleep, enlightened,
as winter returned to the land.


Why dogs don't have horns. In bygone days, male dogs had horns centered in
their high and bony foreheads. The horns were symbols of their prowess,
and many a villager was kept awake at night by ferocious fighting - the
horns clattering against each other. One day Nikuko was wending her way
from the hotsprings in Oita - an enlightened being, she allowed her mind
to drift. Suddenly, a ferret crossed the road in front of her. In a split
second, Nikuko and the ferret changed places, Nikuko now running low upon
the ground, working the roads as cross-walks, heading in and out of the
deep forests surrounding her. Sure enough, a dog approached, its horn hard
against the sky. Nikuko was sweating and naked, her skin scratched by
brambles, her breath hot and heavy from running. The dog lowered its head,
Nikuko exchanged places with the horn. The horn fell useless to the ground
and disappeared forever; Nikuko, astride the dog, changed places with a
bee, a bird, a plant, a butterfly, and a ferret, in just that very order.
Now cooled by the shadows of dusk among the bamboo, she continued on her
way. A monk passed by, laughing, and asked, Nikuko, after all this play,
are you any the wiser? Nikuko replied, not in the slightest, Izanagi, not
the least little bit.


Before there was the word, there was no beginning. Nikuko tried to think.
She couldn't think. She didn't have time to think, and she itched. Nikuko
scratched herself and flakes of skin fell into the water. They became
Japan. Nikuko, thought, I will take a swim. Nikuko said, I am swimming,
and her mouth filled with water. She spat it out and it became Lake Biwa.
Did I just say something, said Nikuko. She thought, now I can say all
sorts of things. Just as she thought that, all sorts of things appeared.
They were grey until she said, What a colorful life. They were dark until
she said, I wish it were sunny out. They were hot until she said, I wonder
when it will snow, and they were too shiny until she said Good night.


Another day Nikuko was walking on the long path from Sata towards the
mountains; the day was overcast and uncomfortably cool. She passed several
fishermen on the way, their nets heavy, their faces weathered, searching
the clouds. The sun was shiny metal in the grey sky; there were mists
about. Someone was walking towards her from the distance, as if in a
dream. Nikuko recalled later that the woman looked like a stranger, then
familiar, then a friend. It was Nikuko walking from the mountains, heading
towards Sata. It's not surprising that I met myself on the road, Nikuko
later said to Izanagi, but it was surprising that I would ever want to
return to Sata, after all.


Izanagi and Nikuko came upon a corpse lying by the side of the road. They
were on the way back from Kagoshima; it was the middle of the night, but
the moon illuminated the landscape. Look, said Izanagi, something is
moving. Sure enough, a thin shadow flitted across the body, which was that
of a young samurai. He is not yet reborn, said Nikuko, and is moving
quickly through rebirth after rebirth; he continues to commit seppuku,
waiting for the proper body. He is bound to the wheel, Izanagi replied;
see how the body freshens every so often, as he almost returns to this
life. With that, Izanagi took his sword and severed the head with one
blow. He'll have to go somewhere else now, said Izanagi, turning around,
but Nikuko was nowhere to be seen.


This is a story that has been told many times, but is well worth the re-
telling. One day Izanagi and Nikuko, for it is true that they traveled
together, were passing by a ridge in the vicinity of Dazaifu. The way was
steep, and suddenly, a white fox bounded across the path in front of them,
disappearing into the bamboo forest. Izanagi said, This must be an omen;
let us keep our eyes open for further adventures. Nikuko remained silent
and thoughtful as they continued on their way. All at once, the forest
grew darker, the birds stopped their singing, and the strips of sunlight
disappeared from the tall stems. Another omen, Izanagi said, and Nikuko
remained silent. A little further on, they came to a stone peculiarly
carved in the shape of a tortoise (Why, at this height, said Izanagi), and
beyond that, they saw a small stream reverse its course, wending its way
uphill. Izanagi spoke again, asking Nikuko, All these omens, what do they
signify. Nikuko replied, These omens announce one another, like the cycle
of births and rebirths; they signify nothing but each other, the eternal
wheeling of worlds. They continued along the path, passing two unicorns
fighting, a woman playing a ch'in in a most mournful manner, golden birds,
and dragons coursing through the air, as they made their way to the
summit.


A well-made shakuhachi is created from root bamboo, worked on for weeks
and months, lacquered inside, a hardwood insert in the mouthpiece. When
Nikuko plays the shakuhachi, whole worlds appear within the moist interior
air between the five finger-holes. Bacteria thrive, stationary waves hold
colonies of protozoa in perfect suspension. After the shakuhachi is
swabbed, smaller life-forms cling to the lacquer, and for hours or days,
cultures appear and disappear. One evening, while Nikuko played beneath
her basket, two robbers approached her. Her shakuhachi was made from a
single piece of bamboo without any joints, and, with the old narrow bore
and wide stem, it was a strong instrument. Nikuko, swinging it this way
and that, defeated them without missing a note. There are many silences in
shakuhachi music, and life-within, life-without, each contains histories
full of pathos, sweetness, violence and despair, lives clinging to the
sounds, suspended.


Nikuko invented the syllabic script; Izanagi threw it away. Nikuko inven-
ted the wheel; Izanagi rolled it out of site. Nikuko gave fire to humans;
Izanagi stole the flames. Nikuko invented clothing; Izanagi tore it into
shreds. Then Nikuko invented all the kanji, a myriad of signs; Izanagi was
overwhelmed. What can I do with them, he said, There are so many, they
will prove useless to men. But men read and reread the kanji, memorizing
each and every one, and out of the shapes of the signs arose the wheel,
fire, and clothing. Only the syllabic script remained behind, nurtured in
the lives of women, always a chance, in this or any other worlds, of sub-
verting, replacing, the kanji. Thus was hiragana born, as a reminder that
invention and memory can reside, not only in the signs themselves, but
also in the spaces between them.


How the snail got its shell. Nikuko pared her toenails, and a slug, ever-
fearful of death, crawled into one of the cuttings. Why the bamboo grows
so straight. Of all the plants, the bamboo first avoided the cycles of
rebirth by least inhabiting the world. Nikuko rewarded it by allowing it
grow the fastest towards the heavens (i.e. a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points). Why water flows downhill. Nikuko made the
reflection of water one of the three gifts, in the form of a mirror. In
order to reflect, water had to fill the land (i.e. flow downhill into
hollows). How the torii originated. Nikuko instructed a prince to build a
bridge that went everywhere and nowhere at once. Why birds fly. Nikuko
needed messengers to Izanagi. Why men are taller than women. One day Niku-
ko was asked what the greatest blessing would be. To see beneath the surf-
ace of things, she replied. Why there are births and rebirths. Once Nikuko
fell asleep, tired from the creation of beings and souls. She said to Iza-
nagi, perhaps there are too many, or perhaps there are still not enough.
Izanagi replied, let them find out for themselves. Why bees make honey. In
order to chant the Amidah in the winter. Why men fight. One day Izanagi
said to Nikuko, there are too many of them, and they take too long to die.
Why flowers open in the summer. To hear the bees chant Amidah. Why the
shamisen took so long to enter the floating world. It took that long to
steal three strands of hair from Nikuko for the strings; that is why the
shamisen plays music no one can resist (i.e. the strings tie up the man in
knots).


One day Nikuko left Wa to see the worlds she had created. She traveled
through Afghanistan and the outskirts of the Roman Empire, coming at last
to Palestine. Here she walked towards the Galil, having heard of a new
prophet, as prominent as Izanagi. She was disappointed; his voice was thin
and his message all too familiar; he also spoke of a poverty of gods. One
day she rose in the morning to the sound of weeping; it was the prophet,
Jesus, forlorn and weeping. I will lose my followers, he said to Nikuko, I
have prayed over and over again for a miracle, and none is forthcoming.
Nikuko said, I can help you; the trouble is that men can walk on water,
and there is nothing to be done here. With that, she created drowning and
forgetfulness; men no longer remembered the flowing of streams and rivers
beneath their feet. When the prophet walked on water, it was he alone who
did so; the rest, by diminution, worshiped him as the miraculous son of
God.


Nikuko was resting at Dazaifu. Izanagi said, Nikuko, how many kami, beyond
the eight or eighty million. There were kami everywhere, pouring from the
stones, from the blades of grass, from the hills. There were kami gathered
in the shrines, shadows swimming without a ripple, beneath the surface of
the ponds. Nikuko replied, Sometimes it's not even me who's speaking,
they're swarming within me, sometimes one or another speaks, their words
escape me and new shrines are built, one even even made a world so fragile
it destroyed itself. Izanagi replied, And I, Nikuko, what is within me.
Nikuko replied, The blades of grass, the hills and pools here, worlds of
inconceivable fragility. Suddenly Izanagi split open and the same world
emerged and settled down, with Izanagi in it. This is the 'Enlightenment
of Izanagi.'


Nikuko and Izanagi were at Kirishimayama, walking among the mountain
paths. Izanagi said to Nikuko, Who will write your parables? Nikuko
replied, It does not matter, there are none about how the Leopard got his
spots. Are there no female Leopards, asked Izanagi. Yes, replied Nikuko,
but the blemish clothed the male. Izanagi said, But who will write your
parables? Nikuko said, There are not enough things in the world for
parables. What would you have, Izanagi asked. More explanations, replied
Nikuko, as if causes had effects, and effects had causes. So parables lie,
said Izanagi, since they imply causes and effects tied together, as men
and women are tied in procreation. Exactly, replied Nikuko, the binding of
parables makes causes and effects, and out of these men and women thrive,
and make culture. What they do then, asked Izanagi? Forget both of us
after a while, replied Nikuko; and they continued on their way.


Izanagi and Nikuko walked through National Park Kirishima. It was a sunny
day; like mothers, the divine mountains embraced them warmly. Let us stop
for a refreshing drink, said Izanagi. Certainly, said Nikuko. They paid
500 yen each, which seemed reasonable. It is good to have a park at the
base of Yamato, where this world began and gods descended and ascended,
said Izanagi. Nikuko replied, It is even better that the base rotates and
wobbles with the rest of the planet, sweeping the heavens above and the
oceans below. Yes, replied Izanagi, we never know where our ascent will
take us, but Yamato is friendly and grateful, and a good place to sit.
Don't spill your drink, said Nikuko, this world has gravity.

Have a little ditty for you to check out if you like.

This is the first piece I've done using Director. It requires the
Shockwave plugin. It also requires a sound card: it's an interactive
sound/'music' piece with my finger snapping as percussion.

It's the first of several I'm going to do in this vein. Since it's the
first, there are definitely imperfections, but you get the idea. I'm
still struggling with the Director program and with the audio software
I'm using.

Good to be back doing sound work, though. I produced a literary radio
show for six years, but haven't done sound work for many years, having
concentrated recently on the page and the screen and the visual. Now
to combine them.

Just checking out some of these links, mostly departing from kominos' =
page.  The "weak blood" anthology seemed pretty interesting, saw some of =
my friends up there, but I'm wondering if it's bit sentimental in its =
attitude toward war; i.e., in the effort that many of the artists make =
to surpass what seem the limitations of the metaphor of technology -- =
that it's instrumental, inhuman in a sense, alienating -- I'm wondering =
if there's a tendency in "cyberpoetry," at least in that anthology (or =
grouping), to try to "humanize" it too hard.  It seems the emotional =
effect becomes flattened after a while, and the prior commitment that I =
think web artists often make to various artistic strands -- the "punk" =
anarchy that one writer was talking about (on this list?  I think it was =
Jim Andrews), or what I read as the Luddite aspect of some artists =
tendency to very low res imgery (sometimes to great effect; I think this =
is the part that ties into some major strands of concrete poetry), or =
even on the pure exhuberence in programming and making things fly -- is =
put aside to achieve different ranges of emotion that don't often come =
off.  Has anybody mentioned this about this (very large) collection of =
work?  I haven't seen it all, I'd like to see more; it was pretty =
impressive anyway.

If you don't think of "emotion," I wonder who is taking up the =
exploration of semiotics and "language-games" that bpNichol and Steve =
McCaffery inaugurated, or really jump-started, with the Toronto Research =
Project.  Do you (anyone,that is) think their work is well-known in that =
community (say, the Rhizome community)?

One piece was a Flash piece -- from 1996! -- that seemed pretty basic to =
me, lots of word morphing and photographs, even within my rudimentary =
skill set (which doesn't matter, of course, it's just that a few basic =
word morphs are the first thing you do).  I've overheard, on the rhizome =
list, in describing the positives of some site, someone use the term =
"and no sh*tty flash stuff," meaning that Flash hasn't any chance.  Do =
web poets or artists shy away from Flash and Director because it's too =
manipulative itself, or too corporate?  Just wondering, since it would =
be difficult to explain which is more corporate, the Pentium chip or =
Flash -- I'm sure someone's brought this up.  I've been working on some =
pretty complex Director-based pieces, and have just started Flash last =
weekend -- lot of fun (got it on ebay).

I guess I've always wondered how the tradition of concrete fairs when it =
comes to presenting complex emotions, or emotions that are =
self-contradictory, which contain doubt in themselves.  Most of my =
friends who have no interest in concrete work (some of whom are =
Canadians, so they've had their exposure) think it's often just =
"one-liners."  I forget who it was, but someone wrote that opera was =
different than drama because it can't, by its nature as music, convey =
"doubt," and though I don't think that's necessarily true, I wonder if =
"concrete" poetries, or poetries that resemble it, can convey "doubt" =
(another question is whether they can construct cultural metaphors -- =
this is why I think Finlay's work is so important, in its role in the =
ironized recreation and critique [some would say the unironized =
promotion] of the use of metaphors, mostly centering around idealized =
concepts of nature -- the scene becomes grander, more complete and =
circumscribable, the shorter, smaller, muter the poem is).  I like work =
that attacks, like jodi.org, and which makes you question the balances =
between human and machine, but I wonder if the opposite is possible -- a =
machine program that says "take me!" or "I think I'm going to feint" -- =
I'm being silly with these examples.  How about: "I'm depressed."

I wonder, also, if web art is always done in a dialectic relationship to =
the gallery system, whereas web poetry is always done in relation to the =
printed page and the system of publication (a much less lucrative =
system), hence the different degrees of energies focused in each, and =
whether there's confusion because of this (not manical confusion, just =
whether this DMZ zone that web artists occupy is standing on so many =
borders as to create a certain "high anxiety").

Cheers,
Brian

how seldom women are posting on this list lately?  and when you/they do it
tends to be announcements and rarely of the discussion nature?  there are
exceptions of course, but i'm asking if others see a trend that i think i'm
seeing.  and i know this list has always had more men posting than women, but
the situation seems to be getting direr and direr.  what's up?

Here is a list of what's coming up over the next few months @
Duration...

After thinking about this for a while, I have decided that I simply
won't have the time to work on the Small Press Bibliography project
that I announced a few months back. While a project of this sort is
something that could prove to be interesting, & perhaps useful, it is
just something that would require more work than I can handle. I would
like to thank everyone who sent me information, & who expressed
interest in the project as a whole.

Anyway...what will be getting underway (again) will be the regularly
appearing announcements page listing new & recent small press
publications. Although this time it will run once a month. The
deadline for the next listing will be January 31 (a more detailed
posting will come soon).

Taking off from the catalog for Burning Deck & paradigm press @
duration, there are catalogs in the works for The Figures, Potes &
Poets, Talisman House, & Krupskaya. Look for these soon.

Work will continue on our Ethnopoetics archive, & archives are also in
the works for ACTS: A Journal of New Writing &, eventually, Montemora.

Anyway...hopefully some of these things will prove interesting,
helpful, &, most importantly, enjoyable, for everyone.

A note that the EPC has been working on a list in progress of "e-poetries".
I'm
certainly happy to receive suggestions of possible additions to this list as I
hope for it to grow. Have a look at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/e-poetry/
Obviously, this is only the first draft of a list in progress!
(Thanks to Peter Sanders for help with this resource.)

I am about as puzzled as I can get about the following

>that's ok, really" attitude in any sense emblematic of

Could Harold Teichman or for that matter anyone clarify this?

I remember the song  "I'm a lumberjack & I'm ok" but what is this about
Warhol having an attitude about being a Brillo Box & being ok?  Surely you
don't mean this as a serious critical remark, Harold.

More scrupulous than most of us, Charles Bernstein, in _My Way_ and
elsewhere, has compared a career in poetry to running a small business--a
comparison intended, I would imagine, to fully implicate poetry in the
everyday.  Like most small businesses, though, most careers in poetry, if
only in a strictly worldly sense, fail.  Poetry may not be *entirely*
competitive, but it is essentially *conflictual*--the conflict being not only
one of values within and for the cultural field, but for the various kinds of
cultural capital that can be acquired by those whose poetry (in a worldly
sense) succeed.  This is one thing that the *discourse* of community
conceals, if the actual fact of community does not.

If you think I am being reductive, let me elaborate just a little more.  It
would be stupid to say that, as Brian gives the example, "Olson wrote
"Projective Verse" because he was interested in a "career" in poetry (or
Hopkins wrote his diaries on "parnassian" verse, or Rimbaud wrote his "Letter
of the Seer") because of careerism."  The anachronism of the word "career"
here is pretty apparent--& while I think it's  rare that anyone's motives are
ever entirely selfless--even the question of more plausible ambitions--fame,
for instance--does not seem particularly interesting in these instances.  Nor
do these motivations seem very relevant to the early stages of Language
Poetry either, for that matter--at least to me.  It's the context, as in so
much else, that's crucial.  If I think that careerism (a bad word since it
seems to solicit the evasive opposition "vocation") is relevant in the
current context **it is because when, like today, the conflict of values is
largely suppressed, the competition for cultural capital becomes dominant.**

But look, I want to put poetry in an impossible situation (anything less than
this strikes me as complacenct).  What we most need--an oppositionalism--may
not be what it is possible to have.  Capitalism *already* carries its
critique;  everything anti-, in other words, has perhaps already been
recuperated.  Charles Altieri, for one, is very good at facing up to & laying
out this dilemna in _Postmodernisms Now_.  Cultural critique, for many of us,
however, seems not to include the capacity to critique our *own* poetic
culture--a blindness that is of course deeply ideological.

No,the american edition was published in 1994 by Exact Change (Boston)as
"Maldoror & the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautréamont" in Alexis
Lykiard's excellent translation. It is a superb book, translation, intro,
etcetera. Only way to read him if you can't do it in French.

Dear Friends,


THE WALT WHITMAN CULTURAL ARTS CENTER

    Notable Poets and Writers Series 2000
                PRESENTS


ROGER BONAIR-AGARD
Friday, February 18 at 7:30 PM
Reading/Performance with Slam to follow.


ANNE WALDMAN
Friday, March 3, at 7:30 PM
Workshop, Saturday, March 4 at 1:30 PM


ROSARIO FERRE
Sunday, April 15 at 2:30 PM
Luncheon and reading presented in collaboration with the Taller
Puertorriqueno.


ABOUT THE AUTHORS:

ROGER BONAIR-AGARD, a native of Trinidad, is a poet, teacher, activist,
slam-coach and the 1999 Individual National Slam Champion.  His work has been
featured in Phat'itude Literary Magazine, Spheric, the Envoy and the
anthologies New Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, and 360 Degrees--A
Revolution of Black Poets.  His first major collection of poems, ...and choas
congealed...is due out this year.  In addition to performing across the
United States, he is a program associate with the New York Readings/Workshops
at Poets and Writers in NYC and has been a featured guest on the Jim Lehrer
Newshour OnLine Focus.   Mr. Bonair-Agard has a riveting stage presence--his
performances mesmerize, enchant, and ultimately air-lift his audience to a
rhythmic spoken-word journey from which they return forever transformed.

ANNE WALDMAN is a poet, performer, teacher, collaborator, editor, former
long-time director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church In-the-Bowery,
and distinguished Professor of Poetics a the Naropa University where she
co-founded the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics with Allen
Ginsberg.  Ms. Waldman was one of the originators of performance poetry
(forerunner of Slam) as, according to Bob Holman, she and Ted Berrigan did a
poetry bout in boxing gear around 1979.   She is the author of over thirty
books and pamphlets of poetry, including, Iovis Books I and II, Kill or Cure,
and the forthcoming Marriage: A Sentence, both from Penguin Poets.  She has
received numerous awards and prizes, among them, the Shelley Memorial Prize,
the Dylan Thomas Memorial Award, and the National Literary Anthology Award.
Her MTV style video, "Uh-Oh Plutonium!" won first prize at the American Film
Festival as a part of the Manhattan Video Project.  A highly energetic
performer, she has read across the United States and throughout the world.
According to Jocelyn Saidenberg of Smal Press Traffic, she never gives the
same reading twice and that, "...you've never felt anything like the
roller-coaster of swoops, dives, tremolo, atman, fire-walking, fast talking,
seven elements of history, myth, gossip, magic, enchantment and theatrical
power..."

ROSARIO FERRE, novelist, poet, feminist, satirist, and literary critic is one
of Puerto Rico's most celebrated authors.  Ms. Ferre had written over twelve
novels in Spanish before beginning her most acclaimed novel, The House on the
Lagoon in 1991, which was a National Book Award finalist in 1995.  Since then
she has written and/or translated several of her novels in/to English
including Sweet Diamond Dust, The Youngest Doll, Tales from the Carribean,
Writing from the Inside, and most recently, Eccentric Neighborhoods.  Of The
House on the Lagoon, translator Gregory Rabassa has said, "Puerto Rico and
the rest of us have been waiting for this story...The book is essential.",
and which the New York Times Book Review called
"Vital...ambitious...playful...A family saga in the manner of Gabriel Garcia
Marquez."

>I wish that everyone on the list could be as intelligent as David Bromige.

It occurs to me that there may be some on the List to whom the depth of
Bowering's mordant humor is as yet unplumbed. While I might wish otherwise,
I know--as do others familiar with this man's m.o.--that he is adding,
sotto voce, "and not a percentage point more." In short, this is actually a
prayer for the dumbing down of the List. For GB knows well the extent of my
stupidity .....isnt he forever asking me why I live in the States? Keep
marrying? Push doors marked "Pull"?

In this light,  his second sentence, "That is how benevolent I feel towards
mankind" shows its true colors, those of sarcasm. A spite against the human
race akin to Samuel Hall's, for whom we are " a bunch of ------s all,"
informs this bleak aside.

And in truth, even if GB did mean well by such a remark, I should feel
bound to pretend otherwise, out of sheer embarrasment. That is the cleft
stick he has me in! Che Maestro!

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 750 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began (at under
100 subscribers). All submissions are reviewed by the moderator
in keeping with the goals of the list, as articulated in this
Welcome Message. We remain committed to this editorial function
as a defining element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news or
activism will also be considered. Other sorts of news or
queries are welcome occasionally; please use "common sense"
when posting and keep in mind that your message, if forwarded,
will be distributed to 750+ persons the world over. Feel free
to query if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the editors regarding
submissions to the list remains confidential and should be
directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate; if
responses are received backchannel and are of interest to the
list (i.e., if they are on topic), we suggest that the posting
subscriber may wish to assemble "highlights" from respondents'
messages to be published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or want to
thank someone for posting something you requested, please send
the request or comment directly to that individual, and not to
the list or to the list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

      <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text".
The use of "styled" text or HTML formatting in the body of
messages sent to the list appears not to be compatible with
the Listserv's automatic digest and archive features; as a
result, inclusion of HTML tags disrupts the list archive
and may have a similarly pernicious effect on the digest
form of the list. Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format. Microsoft Outlook
and Netscape Communicator users take note! You may need to
specify "plain text" or "ASCII text" in the outgoing
messages section of your application Preferences. Check
your application's Edit | Preferences or Help menus for
further details.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

      set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

      set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

Lyn Hejinian, Happily
ISBN: 0-942996-38-0
The Post-Apollo Press
39 pages

This small book by Hejinian presents a linked series of pleasures, pleasures
that are not corrupted by over-arching theoretical significance imposing its
will on the structure, though, indeed, a "theory" seems to be at its base.
That is to say, there is an "ambient" quality to this work, an attempt to
provide the "mental furniture" (it Satie's phrase) to daily living and
thinking which approaches as from a distance, but a distance that is neither
exterior or interior, but is to be found in language.  That it appear "far"
is mostly a quality of the measured incompleteness of the phrasing, which
can be contrasted to the overdetermined quality of the aphorism or rhymed
couplet.  The sentences have a self-containment -- they can be read
individually for their contents and aporias -- but fall, when taken on a
long-view, into a pragmatist's discourse of viewing thought in its
moment-by-moment self-creation: "_Now_ is a blinding instant one single
explosion but somehow some part of it gets accentuated / And each time the
moment falls the emphasis of the moment falls into time differently / No
sooner noticed no sooner now that falls from something / Now is a noted
conjunction / The happiness of knowing it appears" (27)  The reader is
guided along by a rhythmic certainty that doesn't fall into a regularity
suggesting "pace" or a normative meter; likewise, "conclusions" appear --
"Now is a noted conjunction" for example -- which can spiral off into an
entire philosophical thesis (suggesting closure) but which, in obedience to
the method of the poem, leads only to the next moment and the promise -- the
best promise of poetry -- of further discoveries, of "possible futures".
("Dailiness" seems to be some aspect of this, that one should not create
thought or linguistic structures that could not, in fact, survive the
contingencies of day, whether these be impositions on one's reading time or
the hierarchies created when values are too much analyzed, too much banished
to the linearities of, say, academic discourse.)  "There is no 'correct
path' / No sure indication / It is hazy even to itself" she writes, echoing,
in a sense, Dante, but subverting in some ways the entire mythos of the
"bildungsroman" and the promise of metaphysical certainty, in which humans
are banished to the second-tier, "mundane" task of the approach to essence
and the ideal.  Some lines read like counter-arguments to the accusation of
relativity; Hejinian opts for the approach that pragmatism relieves one not
just of final vocabularies but also of any myth that contingent values fail
in their relationship to the "eternal verities":  "From the second moment of
life, one can test experience, be eager to please, have the mouth of a
scholar, hands never at rest, there is no such thing as objectivity but that
doesn't mean everything is unclear and one doesn't fail to choose the next
moment for a long time." (30)  The poem ends beautifully, and it sounds like
a beginning, subsuming within itself both Bergsonian notions of time as a
tactile, immeasurable quantity but whose recognition is revelatory, and the
Marcusian argument that uncontaminated "pleasure" is a quality worth
fighting for in the economic/political nexus, though difficult to deduce
freed of the needs of capital: "No, happily I'm feeling the wind in its own
right rather than as of particular pertinence to _us_ as a windy moment / I
hear its lines leaving in a rumor the silence of which is to catch on
quickly to arrange things in preparation for what will come next / That may
be the thing and logically we go then it departs."  (39)

i participate when the debates interest me and when i have the time to get
caught up in them to the degree that i allow them to interest me.  we've
gone through the "white rage"/yasusada thing before; i think my views are
well-known, no need to re-rehearse them.   when women call fellow-listers
on what they feel to be sexist, often it doesn't work out so well --the
guys get defensive, feel attacked, etc.  the whole tenor of the list has
become more announcement-oriented anyway, since last year.  come to think
of it, the most recent issue in which women were fairly vocal was,
interestingly enough, the class thread.  i haveno analysis of that
phenomenon, just realized it when reading your post.  i hadn't even noticed
women's relative silence being more than usual.

The Anchored Angel: Selected Writings by Jose Garcia Villa
Edited by Eileen Tabios
With a foreword by Jessica Hagedorn
Kaya Production
ISBN: 1--885030--28--2


Kaya Production continues its innovative line of Asian American poetry with
this selected edition of the writing of Filipino American Jose Garcia Villa.
As the famous 1948 photograph from the Gotham Book Mart reception of Dame
Edith Sitwell suggests -- in which he appeared with the likes of Elizabeth
Bishop, Delmore Schwartz, Gore Vidal, W. H. Auden and other luminaries --
Villa was something of an anomaly, in that he was a writer coming from a
colonial property of the United States who was created a poetics that was as
unquestioning of the premises of high modernism as he himself was
unquestioning of his abilities and preternatural calling as a poet.  The
excellent essays appended to this collection by important writers such as
Nick Joaquin, E. San Juan, Jr., and Luis H. Francia, along with the
introduction by novelist/poet Jessica Hagedorn, present the man in a variety
of guises, from the imposing, learned, often didactic, never passive
literary mentor that he was to several Filipino writers in New York, to the
provocateur in the Philippines who never failed to cause a scandal with his
tart tongue and demanding aesthetic tastes (he was, nonetheless, put on the
government's payroll, and had a troubled but intimate relationship to the
Marcos).  As if testament to his chosen tradition of late symbolist poetics,
Villa -- like Valery, Rilke and Rimbaud -- reached a points in his life when
he felt that he had "said all he had to say" and let silence reign -- in
fact, he gave up writing poems after the early sixties, though he often
spoke of an enormous work on aesthetics which he had been preparing.  The
poems that he did leave behind foreground a set of values that might strike
one today as antique, and yet they are surprisingly fresh, and when focused,
very powerful.  The echoes one hears are from writers as diverse as Hopkins,
Dickinson, Blake and Cummings, and his various innovations -- his idea of
"Reverse Consonance" and the later idea of putting commas between every word
(which he linked to "Seurat's architectonic and measured pointillism," and
which, dismissed for many years as a laughable eccentricity, has resurfaced
in practices by poets such as P. Inman) -- seem minor in retrospect compared
to those of Williams or Pound, but attest to the care for the small event in
poems that only surfaces upon a very close reading of the language. The
purity of his approach leaves one nostalgic for a time before deconstruction
and the politics of the referent had converted the aporias of language into
the ironizing of essences and the critique of public values (which is to
say, "before Auschwitz"): "Silence is Thought converging / Unprecipitate,
like / Dancer on tight wire balancing, / Transitive, budlike, / Till -- her
act finished -- in / One lovely jump skips / She to the floor, bending / To
make her bows, dips / Herself in bright applause -- / Then silence is / No
more.  Not it is the rose / Called Speech."  (15)  The comma poems challenge
the reader to break apart and reform meanings, as if to dissuade the
imposition of final interpretation that eventually weigh on many poems:
"As,much,as,I,perceive,the,Future, / Lo: the,Future,perceives,me: /
A,Mutuality,of,Eyes."  (45)  (This suggests Karl Kraus's famous assertion,
as cited in Benjamin: "The more you stare at language, the more it stares
back.")  His later syllabic approach to the stanza resembles, mostly, that
of Marianne Moore's, but unlike Moore, he attempted poems that were not
merely assemblages of "found texts" but which were based on a single
sentence of a single text, hence testing the integrities of syntax.  One
based on a sentence from Andre Gide, for instance, permits him to escape the
more fiery, messianic tones of his earlier poems and yet access the
integrity of his personality which he cherished so much: "Night and sleep
alone / Permit metamorphoses.  Without / Oblivion in the / Chrysalis the
caterpillar / Could not / Become a butterfly: The / Hope of awaking someone
else / Urges me to let / The man I am to sink in- / to sleep."  (83)  As
some of the essays in the end argue, Villa stands at the crossroads of many
discourses, specifically those of postcolonialism and the transition from
modernism to a postmodernism informed by the West's imposition of values on
non-Western peoples.  But Villa seems an unlikely candidate for this
position -- he seems to ignore these issues all together.  However, by his
unflinching devotion to his notions of craft and calling, he becomes a
diamond in the rough -- the diamond he hoped his syntax would find in
language -- and it is this diamond that serves, by its aspirations to
integrity and wholeness, to aggravate and permit growth to a number of
concepts that swirl around the political/aesthetic nexus, each end of the
axis threatening the other.  Besides all that, this book, excellently edited
by Eileen Tabios (who also edited the seminal Black Lightning published by
the Asian American Writers Workshop), is a study in how a relatively small
contribution to two nations' literatures could serve to transform an entire
discourse, once the discourse if forced open by the contradictions of
poetry, and a poet's life.

Please enter the de-puzzlement chamber, Tony.  Ain't worth
getting worked up over a pretty casual remark.  I'm not
really very exercised one way or the other about Warhol.
Is one allowed casual remarks amid serious ones in this
forum?  It was a sort of reference to A. C. Danto's book
of a couple of years ago that made a big deal about the
Moment of the Container of Spun-Metal Soap Pads in the
(meta?)history of art.  That's all.  (I was quite disappointed
in Danto's book, which promises a sort of rigour, and
then fails utterly to deliver.  It's languishing somewhere
in my basement, so I can't quote from it.)

I really was more interested in whether Jacques might
expand a bit on his suggestion about registering symptoms.

As a somewhat fan of some of the "smarter" science fiction utopias, I'm
wondering what anybody knows of explicitly "utopian" poetry. Meaning, not
poetry generally about nice places, but poetry that is aimed at an
explicit construction or enumeration of a utopia. Dante comes to mind, of
course, as do less worked out depictions of heaven in later authors. In
the 20th, perhaps patches of the Cantos? (I seem to remember a reference
early on to a city where the streets are layed out according to the
directions of the stars; I don't have my copy handy, though.)

In general, its not so hard to come up with "utopian" moments in
particular writers, but are there people where the scare quotes, for
whatever reason, aren't necessary? What's out there?

Jacques,

Setting aside notions of poetic practice as “career-“ or “vocation-“
oriented, I nevertheless wonder over the direction of your post with respect
to “competition for cultural capital” enough to ask in what ways your own
work is posed within this continuum, ie., by what means (with whom) and to
what end (for whom).  What form of “cultural capital” do you think to gain –
or more to the point, what is the objectively get-able “thing” one strives
for in the act of writing?  (Is it the raft in the mind of the swimmer, or
some more “real” raft several hundred yards ahead that motivates those
mindful etc. strokes?)  Or is there “something there” at all?  I mean
something that isn’t just a new form of evasion, ie., something that will
have to be characterized in terms more specific than just “something.”
Perhaps the “oppositionalism” you suggest is now needed might be brought to
bear by using other than generic terms - “conflict of values” for example –
what ARE the values, and what, then, comprises the conflict?  An argument
based on “buzz words” is essentially unarguable; despite an apparent
“openness” in the way arguments thus may be transparently couched, in the
end they come to seem rather empty, however much they also seem to point a
way -  more like a sales pitch, however, than a dialogue.  Wch is why I
enquire after what your own stake is, in the picture you present.  (& why,
too, I appreciate your alignment of blindness with ideology – what more have
you to say about that?)

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

In an effort to connect the literary community with AIDS prevention and
awareness organizations, Teachers & Writers Collaborative, in conjunction
with Creative Time and Day Without Art, is embarking on a project that
will result in an on-line web page that echoes and expands upon artist and
writer Joe Brainard's book-length work "I Remember."

Brainard, who died of AIDS in 1994, was a brilliant and hilarious writer
who recorded more than a thousand of his memories in his book _I Remember_
(Penguin, 1995):

        I remember a boy named Henry who was said to have poured a mixture of
        orange pop and popcorn off the balcony of the "Ritz" movie theatre as he
        made gagging sounds..

        I remember that little jerk you give just before you fall asleep.  Like
        falling.

        I remember, at parties, after youUve said all you can think of to say to a
        person--but there you both stand.

What T&W wants to do now is to encourage individuals from all around the
country -- including friends of Brainard's, people involved in AIDS
organizations, students, teachers, poets, writers, hospice-care workers,
and so on -- to write down their own "I Remembers" for inclusion in the
web page.

Submissions can be as long or short as you want -- they'll be edited and
placed in an order that allows each submission to interact and correspond
to other submissions in as lyrical and interesting a way as
possible.  This web page will be made available to the public on April 1,
the first day of National Poetry Month, but will not be limited to this
little window of time.

Your "I Remembers" can be about anything.  Here's an exercise that might
help you get started on your own "I Remember":

        1) Close your eyes and relax.  Take a deep breath, in and
out.  Let your mind go back to something you remember pretty well.

        2)  Let whatever you remember happen all over again in your
mind.  Notice as many details as you can.

        3)  Open your eyes and write down exactly what you just
remembered.  Begin your lines with the phrase "I remember..."

Send all submissions (and any questions you might have) to Daniel Kane at
dkane@panix.com.

Great post. Uh, I think you're right about a lot of the art there at
weak blood. But regardless, the weak blood project is still of note.
It's a wide-rangingly international protest against the war that
happened during the war. One of the main promises of the net, largely
unfulfilled though occasionally so, is in its poetential for
international collaboration, statement, and action. Reiner Strasser
attempted to mobilize this poetential in weak blood. So that even were
you to judge the art as a failure, you would have to qualify it as a
noble failure. And sometimes that's about the best you can do.
Personally, I'm proud to have work in there, however flawed my own or
others is. The frame is crucial in this case, as it often is.

It seems to me that there is an ineluctably Frankensteinish element in
Web art. I think you make a good point. To "try to 'humanize' it too
hard" as you say, is to reject the medium you're working in or to be
in denial about it. And we know what happens to art when an artist
denies themselves the possibility of coming to grips with the very
medium they're working in: it goes flat. There are extremes. One
extreme is the sort of 'hard humanism' you refer to that attempts, for
instance, to deploy the natural world too hard into cyberspace.
Another extreme, perhaps, is a 'become the machine' attitude that
falls into the Italian Futurist pit, which involves a kind of worship
of the machine. Not to imply that this is antiorp's position; as
Taylor pointed out in an earlier post, antiorp is maybe a bit more
complicated than that, dunno.

It's really only now that those sorts of retrospective remarks may
start to emerge? After the war and more of the same.

I'm somewhat familiar with that work. Talanbooks published a handsome
selection of that work about ten years ago, edited by McCaffery I
think, after Nichol's death called Rational Geomancy. I wouldn't think
it would be Rhizome territory, though I might be wrong. Sometimes the
Toronto work read more like development than research, i.e.,
application of 'theory'. There are still lots of people doing that all
over the world. But there was also a formal innovation to some of it
that carries on in this new media/um, together with deep attention to
language. You might want to check out the work of Claire Dinsmore,

I'm just learning Director myself, primarily to do interactive sound
work. Looked at Flash, but my sound card was not down with Flash.
Also, the scripting isn't as extensive as in Director. What I am
mainly concerned about is whether it will allow me to do multi media
as flexibly as I want. How do painters choose their brushes? But we're
not talking humble brushes here. If somebody visits a piece that's
made with Flash or Director, they know it's using Macromedia, it tells
them while loading. Or, if they don't have the plugin installed, it
sometimes takes them through the installation process and you see
Macromedia quite a bit. Brushes don't do that. And brushes don't cost
hundreds of dollars. And companies that make brushes don't lay claim
to leading a painting industry. So there's this whole tangled Web of
implication, yes. But, as you point out, the technology staring us in
the face at this moment from the monitor on through the phone lines
etc is corporate. The machine, small and large, is corporate or
governmental in its construction. We can then be pirates and anti
corporate netizens should we please. But we are faced nonetheless with
our place in a collective undertaking that involves the corporate and
the non human at many levels. This should not be unexamined. And how
can one be other than ambivalent about it, regardless of the choice
you make?

Nonetheless, it is important to me to avoid making work that
capitulates to the default settings and the adman's language and
positions. I would be kidding myself were I to suppose I can do this
with while using Director, however original my work with it may be. I
think of Ted Warnell's work (http://www.warnell.com). He uses Windows
3.11 and no plugins and an intelligent modicum of javascript. He's
very fond of Photoshop though--and uses it with great skill and
effect. But primarily his work is in the HTML itself, not the bitmaps,
which is very unusual (to do it well). I mean his visual works are
made primarily of HTML. That is his primary material.

He posted a note today thanking another poet for posting a work he
could surf without having to upgrade his system or installing any
plugins. A quiet note of protest or possibly exasperation. His
material is largely HTML. He doesn't need plugins. Or he has chosen
his material to avoid plugins? Or what? Is his art somehow more pure
or unsullied by the corporate by virtue of this? Although the question
may have something to it, at this point I look to the art itself, not
so much what it was made with, though some work on the Web is
incompetent enough that it shouts Flash or Photoshop or whatever.

I never connected strongly with concrete poetry. Part of the
'platform', after all, was to create parallelism between the look and
the meaning, simple mindedly mimetic, often, was it not? To be more
generous, it was an approach to cutting through complexity to the nub.
But too often it was at odds with or in denial of the complexity
inherent in language. Language refers to things in the world and to
things not of the world with stunning rapidity. Visual poetries can
acknowledge and operate within those multiples of ghosts and tables
(knock on wood). And they can draw on the emotion associated with the
visual and the word.

But can they develop the intimate familiarity with story and fate and
the course of human affairs associated, say, with stories like Jude
the Obscure or Oedipus......? bp Nichol may have attempted this in the
Martyrology?

Dunno.

You are obviously much more familiar with Finlay's work than I am. And
whether it can "construct cultural metaphors", well, why not? What is
a cultural metaphor and what is involved in the construction?

Interesting question. More than meets the eye to it.

Despite the discussion above about the corporate and the machine and
its place here, as a writer I am relieved to have the Web to publish
on as I see fit. I never liked the print publishing routine or
structures, and you don't get real successful questioning that, not
playing along. Somebody else had the press. Also, given the
geographically dispersed nature of the Web, it's easier to find the
work that's important to you, not being limited to runs of 1000 and
distribution within a single country and tied into a preposterous pr
mentality without critical brains. Any high anxiety I detect is the
result of wrestling with the machine in other ways.

Cool post, Brian. Very interested to look at your Director work. Is it
on the Web?

Jim Andrews

A quik note:

It is hard, as one of four editors for this issue (Cope, Kuszai, Marsh,
Ross), to explain exactly the collaboration that went into the production
of this magazine and the great care with which Bill assembled the inaugural
issue. Anyone who knows the work he has done with PaperBrain Press will
appreciate what it means when we say:

"Each issue of Zazil is hand-made with computer, printer and copier
assistance, with an impressive color cover and faux-parfait binding."

Plus, if you haven't seen the work of Reina Rodriguez, these elegant
translations by Madsen and Dykstra are a must-have. (Sorry to hear about
the Sabres, Kris. Shout out to Miro Satan!)

I recently re-entered the publishing world & as a consequence I read
Publisher's Weekly again. I am not sure who it is (maybe up on the
masthead?), but at present there is a very good reviewer of poetry books -
writes well, smart and is drawing attention to small presses including
Atelos, The Figures and other "out front" critters distributed by SPD. The
column also gives short takes to books that deserve attention as well, so a
bunch of new title ground is covered  - and, interestingly enough, the
reviewer is not unwilling to take interesting critical cuts at books  he or
she considers down a notch in worth. The issue I am referring is probably
last weeks - since we get it in the mail on the West Coast.
Refreshing.
Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Hi, this is Anselm Berrigan speaking, no other parties of the project are
represented.


What does "oppositional" mean, vis-a-vis poetics, as this conversation
takes it?

I raise the question because the portion of the larger poetry community
this list represents has always seemed to me to be fixated on opposition.
I am wondering if the type of critique of poetic culture that Jacques
desires isn't something the poetics list is incapable of providing. And I
don't suggest this with antagonism in mind, more from a feeling that I'm
exposed to many critiques of poetic culture, practically on a daily
basis, but they don't ever come from e-mail lists. In fact, I stopped
paying attention to the list for awhile because every thread seemed to
break down into a conversation that unironically centered Language poetry
as it's subject.

But I am uncertain as to why "an oppositionalism" is necessary (tho' I'm
still catching up on what's been posted). Or is it that a public
statement of oppostionalism is necessary? I am struggling to understand
what is and isn't there, as deemed within this thread.

 Jacques' comment about C. Bernstein's comparison of a career in poetry
to running a small business reminded me of a report of a talk that my
father gave in San Francisco in, I think, 1981, at 80 Langton St, during
which he explained that he thought of himself as a small business person,
and that survival was the issue most at hand. However, there was little
elaboration on the subject, and the writer of the report, Renny Pritikin
(possibly misspelled by me) cited at a certain point "the lack of common
terms" as the main reason for communication breakdowns between Berrigan
and, as it seemed, Bob Perelman and Barrett Watten.

Anyway, and I'm not going to attempt to tie this all together, I also was
wondering, given the notion of "failure" as inherent to poetic practice,
if my father's "career" could be viewed as a success or a failure. Is it
a failure to have your work go mostly out of print withing the small
publishing circles after you've died, only to have a selected come out on
Penguin eleven years after said death. Or is that a success? Or is it too
subjective a consideration to handle?

> what's up?

At the risk of being one of a bazillion posters in reply, there are
several reasons:  I took it seriously when the list changed to
announcements
only, or now, announcements and book reviews

When we had this discussion before re: women ... I don't remember what
the outcome was.  The poetryetc list seems more balanced, britpo, not.
What can I say?

1) I would hate to be outed as insufficiently langpo.

2) I'm busy w/ Jordan Davis on cap-l reliving the West Chester
conference & trying to figure out how to get even more poetry off my
hard drive.

uh, so perhaps some announcements and book reviews to justify this
post?  and a question:  in an issue of Witz, Will Alexander wrote an
essay called "A Small Balletic Hive".  Where is he teaching & how could
I sign up or who can I ask?

Have you checked out my e-chapbooks online, including the one at
Duration
Press (http://www.durationpress.com)?  Would you like to come hear me
read at
the exquisitely-named Espress Y'Self Cafe in Pasadena at 8 p.m. January
27?
Bonus: mention you're from the POETICS list and I will not read
confessional
narrative free verse!  (Actually, I'll be reading love poems.)

Check out recent book reviews of mine at Lynx:  Poetry from Bath,
read.me, and Savoy (http://www.savoymag.com, after January 27th).
However, the poets may not interest you:  Lee Ann Brown, Jeff Clark,
Laura Kasischke, Ann Townsend, Dana Levin, Brenda Shaughnessy, Julie
Fay, Cathleen Calbert, and many more.  Or, more informally:

I have read parts of Pierre Joris' _Breathturn_ alongside my old Michael
Hamburger selected, with pleasure.

I am researching reader response, newish performance theory and
re-researching some architectural criticism for application to technical
architecture.

I am making some lesson plans for logic in poetry and math in poetry,
but doubt I will make the ISAMA deadline.

I finally put away a lot of books I had out to review:
I thought that Annie Finch/Lee Ann Brown idea someone posted was a good
one, and read both together.

an angeleno poets/landscape piece hasn't gelled

Laura Mortiarty's non hasn't been updated in quite some time, but I
didn't finish any song poems that would be good for it anyway, and put
away my Chinese Poetry from the Song dynasty book

I have the Silver Jews cd out because I was surprised we had it in the
stacks, but I haven't listened to it

I have been re-reading all of Christopher Marlowe's drama and all of
Shakespeare for two projects

I am doing some research about pastorals for the perforations "play"
issue and this is going very nicely with the Chinese poetry and nicely
opposing my marinism, gongorism, etc. investigation

I am not the January *Fresh Poet*, but will be instead February *Fresh
Poet* (http://www.freshpoetry.com).

Simon,

the first thing that pops into my head is Blake's Jerusalem by. I'm about
to embark on an investigation of Blake as anarchist so i would love to get
blakish for a while on this list as
the the blake list seems to have disappeared. Also, funny you should
mention dante, i have never really considered him a poet of utopia
vision especially if you consider de monarchia beside the comedy. Too
pragmatic.

cheers,
kevin

"Dioce, whose terraces are the color of stars..."

Intriguing question, Simon. I would venture to say that Duncan, Blaser and
Ronald Johnson all inhabit in one way or another a utopian poetics, if by
utopia one means not so much a site of political production (though in
Duncan & Blaser's case, certainly, this is not entirely true as the idea of
social justice is important to their work), but rather an openly ontological
project where the ongoing recuperation of presence makes available the
liberation (or eleutheria) necessary for realizing the dream of some golden
age. This would be utopia as tikkun, then -- a reparation of the world, to
be understood and undertaken as a process, not as some permanent fixed site
or totalizing system.

I would even venture a little father and suggest that any poetry that is
basically Orphic in nature (Stevens and Johnson both come to mind here) is
lured on by the scent of paradise. There are all sorts of problems with
this, of course. A purely Orphic poetics is one that longs for some kind of
unitive closure -- which would be the kiss of death to the kind of utopian
process I'm outlining.

But throwing the net wider, there are certainly ways in which Gary Snyder
might be considered a kind of utopian poet. Hell, there are moments when I
even think of Joe Ceravolo as a utopian poet, brimming with a paradisical
panache -- if again, by utopia we mean not some form of political
management, not the ideology to end all ideologies (dream on), but the
practice of play, or jouissance, or whatever one wants to call it. The ludic
impulse and the utopian impulse are very close, I think.

I have a feeling this is not the sort of response you were looking for. But
if Johnson is not a utopian poet, I don't know who is -- and I'm smack in
the middle of writing a paper for the Johnson conference so configurations
of the utopic impulse lie thick on my brain.

letter, or a call in the wild."

taylor brady quoting... ahh.. sorry, i missed who was being quoted:

    "Art is created through one's medium's resistance to one's vision,
through some kind of failure of the medium."


        < ? >


   both of these quotations are fascinating to me
   brian suggests just above the quote i pulled that not being able to sense
these resistances makes the work seem facile, as if, i suppose, it might
simply go on and on and never stop and never vary
   the person that taylor is quoting seems to me to implicitly agree with
brian and to (if i'm reading this as meant) go one further suggesting that
it is the medium's 'failure to thwart' (?) the artist's 'vision' that allows
art to.. uh.. you know.. become...


   think for a moment about the poems or artworks you've created --- yes,
~you~, not brian necessarily or taylor or the quoted unnamed poet of those
words but you, poet on this list ;  have you ever written a poem in one
sitting ?  just had it flow out and feel right ?  and then as time goes by
continue to feel fine, as if it didn't need editing, rewriting, rethinking,
renaming, reanything ?
   i can't hear yr answer obviously ---- but i can easily imagine that there
are folks for whom this has never happened and those for whom most of what
they write "stands" as is, that is i know they are out there, both of these
extremes, i've talked to poets who fit with certain reservations of course,
on each end of this continuum
   but most of us fit in the middle i'd guess, maybe having had this sort of
experience now and then but having far more things that did get reworked
edited etc ---- that's where i find myself most of the time but now and then
it happens that i sit down and write something straight thru boom and that's
that
   so then the question arises;  are those poems that just flow, seemingly
without resistance, not art ?  it wd seem that if i was in agreement with
the quotes that started this posting then i wd at least need to be pretty
suspicious about such a spontaneous and effortless work's art status, right
?


   in some cage anecdote that i recall but can't imagine how i wd find right
now,. cage is told by someone who's just heard about how some composition of
his was composed,   "the way you write music, anybody cd do it"   to which
he replies   "of course they cd, but they don't"
   but then, funny thing...  if you take a method of cage's or of mac low's
and use it as faithfully as you are able, perhaps even using the same
materials and sources --- star charts say.... or_gitanjali_  do you think
you wd end up with identical works of art ?   what about just
"overwhelmingly similar" works of art ?  i don't believe it --- as careful
and disciplined as the efforts of each were, to escape intention (cage) and
ego (mac low) neither, it seems to me, do so --- mac low has said this even,
and cage was continually trying new things it seems b/c he kept seeing the
traces of his intention in past work
   ~ s l u r s ~


   my own position (as temporally limited as it is) is that "the resistance
of the medium" can't work as a defining trait for art in any meaningful way
for me --- all it takes is one counter instance and it seems they abound ---
might such a notion of resistance be crucial for someone in their work... of
course --- it has been for me at times, but i've also noticed that the poems
of mine where this sense of the resistance of the medium was most relevant
to me in the act of composition doesnt seem to correlate with anyone else's
sense of the work's resistances --- where does that leave us ?
   maybe art doesnt need any 'defining characters' ?  maybe the
'resistances' are all internal ?  and arent resistances so much as
boundaries between what we're immediately conformable with calling "art" and
what we might be persuaded to embrace as such ?   is it any one's job to do
this persuading ?

--poetry that is aimed at an
   explicit construction

im not sure how to respond to this
but I feel compelled to:

im not sure what an explicit construction is
if it means something like crafted to produce a certain response
and therefore creating an intended 'utopian' sort of community/bond between author and reader
then it is something that I have thought about and experimented with in my writing
(in some form without those terms . . . kind of) but Im not sure this is what you are getting at
I have been rather interested in borges of late
he seems to create odd utopias
Where languages are something like the perfect language of adam or somehow expresses "things" in a more literal or direct cognitive sense . . .
Umberto Eco explores some sense of utopian language in "the search for the perfect language" which is an interesting but highly repetitive read
But its bibliography may be a good reference
(he devotes a section to Dante's Italian poetic language)

the idea of "utopian" poetry is interesting and I wonder where it directs the writer and reader and if a utopian poetry is akin to a perfect communication (maybe, not language)
I wonder more what it means in a constructive "real world" kind of way
Out side of its theory and into the actual production of poetry . . .
Or is it possible to conceive of a utopian poetry without a utopian language . . .

Just some thoughts Simon
if I have strayed far from your intended path
I would like to be re-directed . . .

All for now . . . I think . . .

That is what was really bothering me about
the remark.

It's a pity that Danto's book could discourage anyone from a closer
attention to Warhol's work(s).    & that that shd then become the basis for
further discouragement to others (& so on....) as if the work cd have little
bearing on "poetics" :  saddened now, rather than puzzled.

"So now that I have my jargon of authenticity in place, maybe I can address

your concerns about my inauthentic jargon in a more substantive manner.

First, it's entirely possible that I just wasn't being clear - I usually

post to the list on my lunch break, and in my rush to send something off,

I've caught myself more than once gravitating too easily toward a kind of

notational shorthand that generates all sorts of misunderstandings....."

Taylor, thanks for your carefully thought-out answer. First, your implicit
criticism of my use of the word "art" is on the mark. I was being lazy, and I
grabbed the the most available word to create a distinction with the attitude
(technical mastery...) I was criticizing. Of course, the art "art" has its
own baggage, and it only points to how hard it is to find language which can
slip off its historical coil and made mean something else. (I am not familiar
with Antiorp"; therefore I can't comment with its contribution to this
debate.)

In fact, the tendency of new terms to accumulation verbal baggage underlies
my criticism. It is mental laziness, and it obfuscates.

You question, why didn't I ask you to be clear directly? What kind of clarity
are we talking about? The clarity of "Elements of Style"? Not at all. The
clarity of British empiricism? God forbid. The clarity of Chinese poetry, of
the Turkish poet Orhan Veli, of Barthes's essay "Loyola"? I am all for it.

Arcana: Musicians on Music


Edited by John Zorn


Answering a need for critical attention towards experimental and
avant-garde music, Arcana is a ground-breaking work as far-ranging and
dynamic as the current generation of musicians. Through manifestoes,
scores, interviews, notes and critical papers, performer/composers
address composing, playing, improvising, teaching, and thinking in and
through music. Rather than an attempt to distill or define musicians'
work, Arcana illuminates with personal vision and experience. Arcana is
a remarkable book-challenging and original-essential for composers,
musicans, theorists and fans alike.


"Arcana is a vibrant testimony to the continuing vitality of new music.
These exciting young composers are as idiosyncratic and eloquent with
words as they are with music."



                                                -Meredith Monk. Composer / Singer


"Arcana, edited by John Zorn, is filled with writings by musicians from
all over the musical map. Interested in the sampling, deconstruction
and reconstruction of pop hooks? The historical sociobiology of the
downtown music scene? An American's reaction to the study of Gagaku?
Extended contrabass techniques? A savvy take on ear plugs, amplifier
distortion and pain? This is the book you've been looking for."

Request # 1 (mainly for state-side listmates): If any of you are interested
in chairing a panel at the Twentieth-Century Literature Conference in
Louisville (which I know a number of you are attending), please get in touch
with the Conference Director, Harriette Seiler, at hmseil01@louisville.edu

Request # 2 (mainly for UK listmates, I guess): Do you know of any poetry and
poetics conferences/gatherings this summer in the UK, in July/August?  I'm
coming over anyway and would like to combine the trip with some kind of
conference or speaking gig if possible.  (I know about the one in--is it
Manchester? Salford?  I can't remember--but I can't make that by about 2
days.)  Backchannel, please--and thanks.

Wherever you are geographically, please tune in with your Real Audio player
for an evening of Canadian Sound Poetry live broadcast from the studios of
WFMU with Darren Wershler-Henry and Christian Bok:

http://www.wfmu.org

This Tuesday night, Jan. 24th, from 8-11 E.S.T.

Rumor has it that Christian will be performing his double-speed rendition
of Kurt Schwitters' "Ursonate" and Darren will be reading from texts such
as "Nicholodeon." In addition, they will be bringing down a gang of vintage
obscure recordings of the 4 Horsemen, etc.

And what would a Canadian Sound Poetry Radio Show be without The Nihilist
Spasm Band?

clearly the closing pages of Melvin Tolson's _Libretto for the Republic of
Liberia_ offer a utopian vision of great interest -- all the sadder to read
today in light of present conditions in the actual Liberia, as opposed to
the metaphorical Liberia of the poem --

LIVES AND HALF-LIVES: A Poetry Reading by Kathy Lou Schultz and Liz Waldner
Saturday, January 29  8 pm
New Langton Arts
1246 Folsom Street
San Francisco, CA 94103
415.626.5416 ph


San Francisco - On Saturday, January 29, New Langton Arts hosts readings by
Kathy Lou Schultz and Liz Waldner, two young poets who investigate the
matrix of aesthetics, identity, class, and sex. Schultz and Waldner write
poetry that combines challenging content and formal innovation. Their work
is surprising, subtle, and worthy of attention. Waldner reads pieces from
her Iowa Prize for Poetry winning book, "Point Is That Which Has No Part".
Kathy Lou Schultz reads poems to be announced. Tickets are $6 general/$4
students, seniors, Langton members. New Langton Arts is located at 1246
Folsom Street in San Francisco. For information call 415 626 5416 or visit
the Web site at www.newlangtonarts.org.

Kathy Lou Schultz was born in Burke, South Dakota in 1966, and resides in
San Francisco. She is the author of "Genealogy" (a+bend press, 1999) and
"Re dress" (San Francisco State University, 1994) and is a founding editor
of Lipstick Eleven and Duck Press. In the past 20 years she has held
numerous jobs including counselor for battered women, grassroots organizer,
volunteer coordinator, Nebraska vacation guide, childcare worker,
proofreader, and creative writing instructor. These days she is an editor
in the high-tech industry. Schultz's recent projects include a forum on
class and poetics which she co-edited with Robin Tremblay - McGaw. She is
currently working on a scholarly project on the writings of poet Erica Hunt.

Liz Waldner is a resident of Iowa and is the author of "Homing Devices" (O.
Books, 1998). In the words of local poet Laura Moriarty, "Liz Waldner is
tough with words. 'Homing Devices' is Spicerian in subject matter (sex,
tarot, language, Dante, romance, gender, sex), as well as in its speechy
ironic diction." Waldner has published poetry in many small magazines and
is the recent recipient of the Gertrude Stein Award in Innovative American
poetry and the Poetry Society of America's Robert M. Winner award.

maybe it's because we're busy working / creating. I believe writers/artists often
exist in cycles -- months reading/thinking learning/gestating, months working.
Then, of course, there are also deadlines ...

Subject:      Little Review: Enrique Lihn, Figures of Speech
Mime-Version: 1.0

Figures of Speech, poems by Enrique Lihn
translated by David Oliphant
Host Publications Inc.
188 pp.
ISBN: 0--924047--17--8


Figures of Speech presents, in an all-too brief format, the life of an
interesting, unsparing poet; indeed, the format of the posthumous "selected
poems" often provides the illusion of a completeness to one's life, but a
reading of Lihn's work demonstrates how this struggle with a sense of
wholeness seemed not to be resolvable even by the prospect of death.  Lihn
was one of Chile's foremost poets, yet, despite a collection published by
New Directions in 1978 (The Dark Room and Other Poems) and an earlier
translated volume from 1969, he has not acquired the reputation in the
States of his countryman Pablo Neruda.  This careful, liberal selection from
the poet's first pamphlet to his deathbed poems (but not including his
political poems and long poems such as "Written in Cuba") by Lihn's friend
and translator David Oliphant, goes far to redress this situation.  The
opening "Portrait" describes the poet at his most bitterly reduced but most
youthful as well, a self-description that rivals such works as "The Waste
Land"  or Rimbaud's "Seven Year Old Poets" (and, even earlier, Nerval's
writing ) as an image of the fractured sensibility taking on the ancient
mission of the bard in the modern world: "Poet from head to toe / a man of
bitten fingernails, convulsive, neurotic, / orphan of the eagles, father to
his own increase, [...] / his soul rarely diminutive, / appeared on going
away, / furious in his happiness, joyless in his grief, / abortion of his
very chaste orgasm, / the gardener's dog... [...] / his secret transparent
not by choice, / obscure from convergent intents." (3)  It is these
"convergent interests" that mark the site of the ambiguous self shoring its
ruins against the request for identity, public or poetic (or, conversely,
shoring its sense of identity against the request for plural universality.
This image of the writer is revised in the later, more complex poem
"Literature," where he considers not just himself but his South American
countryman in their quixotic mission, corrupted by it is not just by
self-delusion but the mundane nature of social recognition (he is almost
Artaudian in his iconoclastic reduction-to-absurdity, but humbled by his
unheroic, bureaucratic muzzle): "When I find myself around other writers /
we do little more than speak like good or bad functionaries /   of
Literature [...]   / When I run across such stars of the first order / and
those peacocks shine with the necessary prudence / I'd like to invite them
to puke, because writing as well as they / is to perform the blandest task.
When I come upon myself / facing the empty page I think of peacocks / and
try at least not to show off, but I write / to the extent of my hatred for
literature, / and to young authors I would like to yell / cut it with the
farce, you too will enter the business / because literature is the softest
of jobs [...]." (41)  His sonnets -- which Oliphant translates in their
exact rhyme scheme thought the original Spanish is en face (these can be
awkward, as when he breaks the word "chorus" into "cho-/ rus" for the sake
of rhyme) -- states the case more poignantly, conjuring the image of a man
just barely being kept afloat by words: "What would I be without my words /
without my signs of impotence,"(55) and earlier, in which he imagines
meeting his double, he concludes that he walks "in vain / behind his very
self minus his literature." (49)  (Ironically, one of the poems Oliphant
translated was lost in  its original Spanish, and Linh had to reconstruct a
Spanish "original," included in this collection.)  That the occupation of
words, of naming, is growing ever more tenuous, and that syntax's value is
fading among the proliferation of the values inculcated by
telecommunications, is conveyed in the effective title of one poem, "Age of
Data," which concludes "data is just the opposite of God." (39)  The section
"Brooklyn Monster" contains poems Lihn wrote in his travels in New York,
Texas, Canada and Spain,  and will, of course, evoke for American readers
Lorca's poems of "Poet in New York," mostly through the vignette-like
approach and empathy for the dispossessed they share, as in the poem
"Brooklyn Monster" itself, in which he creates a frightening,
expressionistic portrait of a lone rider: "The man / -- if it is not a woman
-- dresses like a half-naked conscript, like a cadaver / they would have
carried from concentration camp to the crematory oven / With feet much
smaller than its destitute shoes / The woman -- if it's not a man -- with
white / plaster make-up running down its face / in the ritual expulsion of
sex" (107).  Linh's Toronto is unlike any you will find elsewhere, but is
worth reading as a contrast to the relative disinterest in mythologized
"cities" in Canadian poetics.  In "Europeans," which is set in Paris, his
mixed-feelings about the continent's cultural legacy are most completely
assayed; at one point he mocks a tenet of Godard's semiotics while, later,
he admits he is "wrong," finding some value in the philosophy of surfaces, a
philosophy much at odds with his Latin American (perhaps both Catholic and
American Indian) need to read below the surfaces, to find correspondences.
This is not to say he is unsophisticated or baffled in his outlook; in fact,
he finds a way to read the paradoxes of what he experiences, such as his
run-in with a European whose words contradict her own novelistic presence:
"Those people that French lady those noses like / a lady's antennas and
stilettos or radars [...] / We're all dead -- she repeated -- even though
her / wonderful legs shouted to the contrary / and her nose flitted ecstatic
over tropics / with a modesty occasionally exemplary among / her
transatlantic kind / stripped of excesses of / intellectual curiosity / as
ever happens / when a woman of fifty travels / universally alone be she
French or not [...] (97)."  The several poems from his deathbed are, the
translator notes, among the most moving written on the subject, but as they
are often more abstract they don't often carry over well as the earlier,
satirical or expressionistic ones.  The title "Pain Has Nothing To Do With
Pain," for example, hints at the difficulty of translating these poems -- it
sounds a bit awkward, even if those words correspond directly with the
original.  Nonetheless, as Oliphant writes in his introduction, this is a
scathing metaphysical critique of the roles doctors seem to play in
prolonging the process of dying: "Perhaps doctors are nothing but experts
and death -- the apple / of their eyes -- is a pet problem / science solves
it with partial solutions, that is to say, it puts off / its undissolvable
nodule sealing a pleura, to start with / It may be that I am one of those
who pay anything for the procedure.  (153)"  The "Art and Life" section
contains some of Lihn's many poems on the visual arts, concerning such
artists such as Turner and Kandinsky, but it also includes his most humble,
and most affirmative, credo on art in society: "People who circle around the
museum pieces / forgetful of their condition as museum pieces / and who
seem, well, to ignore where they are / The Metropolitan Museum of Art is a
work of art / accomplished by their artistic lavatories. // We are works of
art momentarily alive." (65)  This poem, itself called "Art and Life,"
envisions a unified field theory of art, speech and personhood that serves
to override any neurosis about the fragmentary human self, and even death,
suggesting, with a sort of nod to theories of ambience, that individuals,
like art, are vessels of meaning, with the added bonus that we know
something of what these meanings are.

POEMS:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pool House Parties at Grandma=92s Condominium Complex

When we tired of ice-cream
and pizza there was always
something new: my best friend
Sherri spotted the apricot tree,
dry orange skin licking our lips
with summer, tan lines where
bikini straps went down.  We
just graduated junior high
and asked Grandma to have
our parties at her pool.

All the boys came that summer=97
the short ones like Brad Peckler
who hopped when he walked
and skinny Kenny Mann who
could slip through any gate, and did
the night Allison=92s father told her
to get inside, and didn=92t even see
she was with him.  There was Jeffrey
Zerska with curly blond hair
who never let go of his basketball,
even when he was six feet deep
in chlorine or floating the ball
between him and Darlene for his
first, thirteen year-old kiss.

This bliss, the running start and splash
in the deep-end where Danny Lipman
clung to the edge, small muscles
in his biceps showing through skin
like underwear lines as he climbed
up the ladder.  We wanted to see
what was underneath these boys,
and when tired of swimming
we ran into each others=92 saunas,
girl-boy, girl-boy, all heat and sweat
and quiet talk, thighs touching,
quadriceps bursting forth
like a faun through the woods,
a near idea of what we=92d become:

pointy triangles for breasts
and the slight floss of hair
around boys=92 nipples.  The creak
of the sauna door in Danny Lipman=92s voice
before he asked me to show him
the apricot tree in the pool house yard.
The hair baked to our scalps with dry heat,
as if we were comfortable in our borrowed
bodies, as if we all held basketballs
in our arms, ready to go anywhere
the ball would take us.

The Advanatage of Discord


in the movement of stitching
a moment of salt
appears, attached to the thread
the air holds up to sky

less of wings moving
more the sound of water
crowded by living rocks
in years gone by

fish rcognize the fake self-sacrifice
by chewing off their feet
then alone walking through
the apples, before the heat
opens in the room again

_Twins falling thorugh the sea_

what does the drain keep saying?
could it be, yesterday, today
were wasted?

cold guardians on an autumn walk
wade back into the read lake
angry at inanimate air

One thing I might mention about poetry and the discourse on technology is
that many of the founding thinkers that are often alluded to in these
discourses, such as Deleuze and Guattari, Benjamin, Foucault, MacLuhan,
Derrida, etc., were literary critics (and only occasionally, it seems, art
critics), concerned with people like Kafka, Brecht, the Surrealists [the
writers], Joyce, Plato, etc., in the formative parts of their careers (sorry
for the male-o-centric list, can't think of a woman writer this group I
wrote about).  Hugh Kenner, the great Pound critic, wrote a book called "The
Counterfeiters" a long time ago that went through people like Babbage and
Turing, and it's worth noting that the Turing Test for Artificial
Intelligence was centered around language, as was his job for the British
during the war, figuring out German ciphers. Finally, people like Cage, with
his mesostics, or Jackson MacLow with his semi-intentional works (his books
"Forties" for example), were pushing the idea of "process poetry" into the
realm of the semi-automated, or computer-influenced (some will write
"chance" but as we all know the random-number tables on computers are
hard-coded), hence subtracting or transforming certain notions you allude to
below -- the "spiritual" component of poetry, poetry as personal expression,
as transcribed "overflowing" speech -- into a discourse on cybernetics,
without, consequently, cramping or slanting the process by using the
_language_ of technology in therr works (or, differently put, rendering the
works "strange" by the use of this language), fetishizing the sheen of
technology over the larger social and aesthetic aims of their writing.

I was a computer programmer before I was a poet -- I had a Sinclair 1000
when I was a lad, and got the Vic 20 when it first came out, programming
mostly games (o lovely peeks and pokes, where have ye gone?), but gave it
all up in high school as it didn't seem, to me, to hold much promise for
different sorts of communication, i.e. I felt work in computers kept me away
from the world too much, it was contained on the little cassettes and went
nowhere.  (Also, I just wasn't smart enough to learn machine language, and
being in high school, I was more interested in my libido than my own
personal version of Lunar Lander.)  The internet, obviously, changed all
that, and since the mid-nineties I've been learning, or have learnt, C++,
Java, Javascript, a handful of other web-tools, etc., and I see these
studies as an extension of my interest in language.  So that's my
connection.

Yes, Lykiard's translation is by far the best.  There's also the Penguin
version by Paul Knight.  Speaking of things Lautreamont....have there been
any new discoveries of late regarding Isidore Ducasse?  I've found the "new"
letter Ducasse wrote to Victor Hugo at a great Maldoror site on the web, and
of course his startling portrait has been around since the late 1970's--but
has anything else turned up of note?  Jesse Glass

Dear Brian,

Thanks for such a kind and well meant reply to my note.

I've become quite sceptical of our intellectual fathers.  Shattered faith,
caused by reading such as "The Science of the Concrete" by Claude
Levi-Strauss, realizing he completely misunderstands the praxis of
painting, unable to grasp it outside his own intellectual paradigm.
Foucault? Please, Panopticon me!   Freud?  What an egoistic monster!  It
seems the intellectual process contains it's own downfal in excluding all
other forms of thought, all other mental functions, denying them
credibility.  This from being unable to grasp anything but reason as
reasonable (we know what reason is, but reasonable has many variations)-
the "spiritual" component of poetry, poetry as personal expression, as
transcribed "overflowing" speech, as you note.

Jung defines four functions in the mind;  sensory informs, intellect
classifies, feelings assign value, and intuition "lets us peek around
corners," but it seems to me intuition also gives thought it's linear sense
within a frame work of time;  it may be the bridge, the leap  between facts
and events that confers understanding, the glue that places concept
linearly into an graspable framework.

In any case, spiritual seems to me a symbolic value for that which is
larger than knowing, and it's assigned an odorous "churchability" so that
cretins may hold it in respect.  I agree more with the ancient Jews that
God has the morality of a five-year-old, or with the Taoists that life
revolves equally around positive and negative values.  But Lordy-Lord,
there's something freaky and huge in the universe.  Jung suggests the
unconscious is the gateway, a direct link to the infinite, and I thought
that made sense since the mind can only operate according to the way
carbon-based cells can think, and so structurally is tuned to universal
precepts.  Hence poetry, as it pours into consciousness, is more a
universal product than an individual glory.  We can analize it but the
genius who writes valid poetry intellectually is probably using other
functions unaware.  Did you know that Cromwell, a superb military
tactician, did not consider himself so but said that his military decisions
were on-the-spot revelations from the Almighty?  The religious cover to his
intellectual functions were similar to the skins of web sites, the
interface.

I always thought intellectuals were formed by being beaten up in the
sandbox at the age of five, running home and burying their noses in books
to avoid having to deal with life ever again.  While the intellect is
nature's newest crown (we tried dinosaurs but after 400 million years,
having proved that big is stable and might is right, we wiped them out and
gave the little monkeys a chance).

But why is a picture worth a thousand words?  "The three-dimensional
illusion of the socialist realist painting can be broken down into discrete
signs... it is read by spectators familiar with the appropriate codes... To
the viewer of the Stalinist period, moreover, it offered the additional and
truly aesthetic experience of terror, since an incorrect coding or decoding
could mean death."(1)

>Also, I just wasn't smart enough to learn machine language, and
>being in high school, I was more interested in my libido

That's why I think maybe that was a smart move at that age.  Language makes
us, and who wants to be a machine?  Those who abandonned humanitarian
attitudes in the '70s to concentrate on technology also abandonned their
humanity.

But in all this I wantonce again to reflect on an immense universal
potential which is destroyed by thought.  Zen, for example, taps into this
by stilling the mind with monotony, though I do believe that if we are on
the wheel of reincarnation and suffering, immersion in the wheel and the
passions is probably closer to the structural intent of the process that
trying to run away from it.

In conclusion, I don't believe that high or low tech has any bearing when
the inner powers of the mind seek to express themselves.  It is this inner
mind thing which is so fascinating, and what is it's relation to the
consciousness sitting over it?

Thanks again for your patience.

I am on the Editorial Board of the new on-line journal introduced
below, so wanted to share this announcement. Work for the first
issue is now being accepted. Poetry and Poetics will be regularly
featured.

---------------------------

RHIZOMES: CULTURAL STUDIES IN EMERGING KNOWLEDGE
AND STRANGE ATTRACTIONS

Editors:

Ellen Berry, Bowling Green State U
Carol Siegel, Washington State U

Board members include:

Crystal Kile, Tulane U
Douglas Dix, Prague.
Lawrence James, Prague (Editor of the Prague Review),
Martin Prochazka, Prague, Charles University
Mikhail Epstein, Emory U
Tadesu Slawez, Warsaw
Steve Shaviro, U of Washington
Laura Frost, Yale U
Joanna Freuh, U of Nevada
Inderpal Grewal, San Francisco State U
Bryce Cambell, Washington State U
Michelle Kendrick, Washington State U
Karmen MacKendrick, Lemoyne College


RHIZOMES opposes the idea that all knowledge must grow in tree
structure from previously accepted ideas; new thinking need not
follow established patterns. RHIZOMES exists to promote
experimental work located outside or beyond current disciplines
and interdisciplines, work that has no proper location. We are not
interested in publishing texts that establish their authority merely
by affirming what is already believed. Instead, we encourage
migrations into new conceptual territories and new critical forms,
the productive mutations resulting from unpredictable juxtapositions
and strange attractions. As our name suggests, works written in
the spirit of Deleuzian approaches are welcomed but not required.

As an online journal, RHIZOMES emphasizes the use of interactive
multimedia as a way of fostering experimental, imaginative
scholarship that challenges existing critical forms. Submissions to
RHIZOMES need not include a developed multimedia dimension;
however, authors should consider how their essays might be
enhanced by multimedia presentation and be prepared to work with
us to create a dynamic text suited to our electronic format. In the
spirit of dialogue between contributors and reviewers, RHIZOMES
engages in an extended and collaborative review process. In
addition to an initial screening by editors, contributions will undergo
a "blind" review by at least two members of the editorial board for
content suitability and quality. All contributions will be subject to a
more technical review of the multimedia options for enhancing
theme as well as design. Authors of accepted and/or revised
contributions will work closely with both the editorial and technical
editors to establish more effective multimedia presentation. As part
of this creative development team, contributors may be asked to
supply relevant image and sound files or to assist in the selection
and development of these options by the journal editors.

All submissions should be sent as hard copies to Carol Siegel,
English Department, Washington State University, Vancouver,
14204 NE Salmon Creek Avenue, Vancouver, WA 98686-9600. In
addition, if the document is online, please submit a URL so that
the editors may view the submission in its existing web format. All
submissions should conform to standards for general format and
citation that govern publications in the author's field, and include a
bibliography, if appropriate. We will consider short pieces, but
cannot consider texts of more than 7,500 words, including notes.

                                                                ***

Actually, there _is_ also a New Directions edition-- I know, because I have
it-- by a different translator (Guy Wernham, if memory serves; & again I
apologize, because my access to email is at work, and my books are at home).
  I wasn't aware of this newer edition, which sounds interesting.  I also
have no idea whether the New Directions edition is still in print.

Susan (Bee) just now pointed out to me a notice in the obituary listing in
todays NY Times that Lita Hornick had died. I have no information about her
death except this, but I do know Lita Hornick, who was the publisher of
Kulchur
magazine and Kulchur, both of which made a vital contribution to the poetry of
the 60s through 80s, publishing many outstanding poets and collections by
poets
in the "New American Poetry" traditions. I hope others on this list will fill
in on the history of Kulcher and Lita Hornick herself, who was an extravagant
character, and the author of one collection of poems.

I'm not surprised you feel that
 way, Karen, since representing states
 of feeling is so clearly your
metier -- "Venus return" -- which
  I did enjoy, ty Karen.

Reading all postings as offering "states
of feeling", not a few seem keen to assert
some power over the discursive
space, over listeners,
 -- sometimes
with sheer length, sometimes with
 judgements "supported" with argument
of (variable) cogency, sometimes
with  postings that seem to be
 demonstrations
 of literary critical academic
professionalism.

 Maybe
that's what is at issue in
   this thread.

        This is not about something directly "new" re Lautreamont, yet may
be
fitting as Jesse Glass used to live here in Milwaukee, where I first met
him and read Glass's  works via a mutual friend who had done a journal
with Jesse, Tom Pharmakis.
        Two days ago the poet Bob Harrison introduced me to a man named
Andrew who is also much inspired by French poetry.
        Andrew that day had been walking down a street with a copy of the
good Ducasse's works in his pocket and came upon a window shrine in a home
on a Milwaukee street devoted to M.le Comte de  Lautreamont/Ducasse.
        A fitting conjunction--
        A very interesting edtion of MALDOROR is that translated by John
Rodker, with an introduction by Remy de Gourmount and a frontispiece by
Odilon Redon.  (I believe the first English translation of the work.)
        It is "Privately Printed for Subscribers Only, The Casanova
Society, 1924".
        Rodker translates the title  as "THE LAY OF MALODOROR"--
        It should be noted, re Alexis Lykiard, that he also did a superb
translation (with accompanying French original en face) of Lautreamont's
POESIES AND COMPLETE MISCELLANEA (London:  Allen & Busby, 1978).
        I would highly recommend this edition as it contains
letters, biographical reminiscences, contemporary reactions, bibliography,
etc, as well as excellent notes on the texts.

Not the address of the group that brings all its umbrellas to the operating

    BUT

to the people who spoke French first,
does the name
MALDOROR sound like it means "Golden-evil-gold"?

Some examples of Utopian poetry which occur to me:

Ben Jonson's Horatian dinner invitation the title of which I forgot
(.....hurst, I think).
Andrew Marvell's "The Garden."
On a less conservation and more critical level: Shakespeare's "Measure for
Measure" (an anti-utopia) and "The Tempest."

Just a quick note to clarify my lazy conflation of the term "cultural
capital" in a previous post.

According to Bourdieu, symbolic capital would refer to accumulated prestige,
cultural capital to a certain cultural competence--the ability, for example,
to use Bourdieu's terms correctly-- and economic capital would obviously
refer to $$.

Responding to Patrick Pritchett's comment on the utopian in poetry (copy
below):

Yes, I agree with your specific sense in which Duncan, Blaser (add
Olson, and why not Ginsberg)…Snyder, et al are aimed in a utopian
way—that is, driven by the sense that a more nearly perfect world is
possible on earth, some sense of Pound's "Paradiso terrestre," but I'm
not sure about the "closure" of the "Orphic" if that applies to Duncan,
whose particular sense of the utopian would be of course his "Open
Universe."  (I think I'm agreeing with you here but maybe adding a
nuance with a difference.) Even Pound seems in the end to realize that
his struggle for a literal earthly paradise drove him nuts and to a
regrettable and regretted politics, yet he maintained, or maybe in his
despair got clearer about, a sense which Duncan and later Olson had that
somehow the connection of poetics with utopia is the state of being, as
it were, state of mind, state of language, out of which the
un-pre-knowable ("projective," "open field") possible world might
emerge.  This is a big subject that I short-hand here to urge the sense
of utopia toward the condition of renewal that poetics itself embodies
in its nature, but most explicitly in any degree of conscious
transformation, and this I would say begins with Blake.  Not
particularly the Blake of "Songs of Innocence & Experience" except as a
complete self-transforming system and in relation to the emerging later
poetics that comes to fruition in "Jerusalem," all of which implies a
very specific critique of civilization—theology, politics, art,
poetry—and the root causes of the non-self-realization standing in the
way of a more perfectly realized human condition.  I consider Blake's
overall opus (incl. poetry and visual work) to be the closest to a
realized utopia on its own intrinsic ("open universe") principles, which
includes rejection of all models of utopia as embodying the very
limitations of thinking that paradoxically prevent anything truly
utopian (i.e., humanly self-perfective) from arising.  A big part of the
problem with applying the notion of "utopia" to poetics is the word and
its history—it makes me uncomfortable to use it, because of the effort
it takes to shake off its overly concretized history.  Like trying to
imagine something great but as you get closer you realize that the mode
of visualizing it has foredoomed it.  Big visions are often cemeteries
of imagination.

Your observation that the "ludic impulse and the utopian impulse are
very close" is brilliant. In that sense Dorn's "Gunslinger" is a sort of
ontologic-ludic-utopian something in an odd topological focus. Again
there is Blake's  "Marriage of Heaven & Hell" as an inverse bible (which
for Blake is never separate from the issue of utopia, since he thought
about real politics every day, as Erdman established)—also a very funny
poem.

Subject: Re: Utopias

"Dioce, whose terraces are the color of stars..."

Intriguing question, Simon. I would venture to say that Duncan, Blaser
and
Ronald Johnson all inhabit in one way or another a utopian poetics, if
by
utopia one means not so much a site of political production (though in
Duncan & Blaser's case, certainly, this is not entirely true as the idea
of
social justice is important to their work), but rather an openly
ontological
project where the ongoing recuperation of presence makes available the
liberation (or eleutheria) necessary for realizing the dream of some
golden
age. This would be utopia as tikkun, then -- a reparation of the world,
to
be understood and undertaken as a process, not as some permanent fixed
site
or totalizing system.

I would even venture a little father and suggest that any poetry that is

basically Orphic in nature (Stevens and Johnson both come to mind here)
is
lured on by the scent of paradise. There are all sorts of problems with
this, of course. A purely Orphic poetics is one that longs for some kind
of
unitive closure -- which would be the kiss of death to the kind of
utopian
process I'm outlining.

But throwing the net wider, there are certainly ways in which Gary
Snyder
might be considered a kind of utopian poet. Hell, there are moments when
I
even think of Joe Ceravolo as a utopian poet, brimming with a
paradisical
panache -- if again, by utopia we mean not some form of political
management, not the ideology to end all ideologies (dream on), but the
practice of play, or jouissance, or whatever one wants to call it. The
ludic
impulse and the utopian impulse are very close, I think.

I have a feeling this is not the sort of response you were looking for.
But
if Johnson is not a utopian poet, I don't know who is -- and I'm smack
in
the middle of writing a paper for the Johnson conference so
configurations
of the utopic impulse lie thick on my brain.<

"Memory, Representation and the Black '60s," is a two-day event organized in
conjunction with "Mementos," an exhibition of the work of Kerry James
Marshall on view at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.  In "Mementos," Marshall
explores the impact of public tragedies upon private lives and histories.
His multi-media installation creates spaces in which people can come to
terms with the losses and gains associated with the sixties. The Cultural
Studies in the African Diaspora Project, the Center for African American
Studies at UCLA, and the Santa Monica Museum of Art have invited prominent
scholars, curators, and artists to reflect upon the impact of race politics
during this period.

There's also a Penguin Maldoror in a translation done by Paul Knight that
came out in 1978.  The edition additionally contains translations of two
long poems dressed out to look like prose, ie., very like Maldoror itself:
"The poetic whines of this century are nothing but sophisms" - sounds like
that home truth has been coming home for quite a number of years.  Doubtless
this version of M

doesn't come up the the level of the more recent Exact Change publication
Pierre mentioned, but it's one that's liable to turn up in a 25 cent bin on
a street somewhere in your town, if you want to check out Lautreamont at a
cost that's next to nothing. (Too bad, tho, that L's writing seems so often
accompanied by terrible works of Romantic art, like "The Deluge" by Joshua
Shaw that graces the cover of this one.  Why not instead a diagram of Venus
Mechanitis in the act of dispersing a heaven's allotment of stars across a
blank blackboard at dusk, maybe with her fingernails?  Tho on the other
hand, too, bad taste DOES make the world go 'round ... )

Here's what Gooch has to say about Lita Hornick in his O'Hara biography:

"Married to Morton Hornick, the owner of a lucrative curtain business,
Lita used to be referred to as Lita Curtainstar by Andy Warhol, who
painted her portrait in 1966.  In the early 60's though, before she moved
full-force into the artworld, most of Hornick's friends were downtown
poets...Kulchur was able to fill its self-defined niche as 'the only
vanguard magazine devoted principally to Criticism and Commentary --
essays on literature, art, jazz, politics, and pop culture by leading
poets.'  It's board in 1962 was largely a co-opting of O'Hara's inside
group.  He served as Art Editor, LeRoi Jones as Music Editor, Bill Berkson
as Film Editor, and Joe LeSeur as Theatre Editor."

Gooch forgets Gilbert Sorrentino, who was Poetry Editor.  O'Hara's letters
make it clear that this line-up of editors was Baraka's doing, and that in
the early 60's Hornick had given him most of the editorial control over
Kulchur, where, among other things, his essay "Tokenism" appeared.
Kulchur was also one of the main outlets for Martin Williams jazz
criticism, which is quite good--Williams was one of the first (maybe *the*
first) writers to praise Ornette Coleman in print--even before he hit NYC.
That said, and whatever her role in deciding content may or may not have
been, KULCHUR, especially around this time, was a *great* read.  I had a
terrific time going through them recently in Brown's Harris archive.  And
never let it be said that Hornick didn't know a good crowd when she saw
one!

Kevin K. and I will be out of town February 15 - 19.  (Returning the
evening of the 20th).  Anybody responsible going to be in town and
need a place to stay?  Our apartment in a funky neighborhood, but
it's very accessible to public transportation/walking distance from
just about any place you'd want to go.  All you have to do is feed
our two friendly cats.

Backchannel.

While in Vernon B.C. staying at a friend's rented wartime duplex I watched a
part of a program about how (un-)planned community suburban neighborhoods (like
the one I was staying at) were instantly built back in the late 40-s early 50's.
The dreams of developers that created the nuclear family of which a 2-3
generations have grown out of. Every family a car (ad the second car for the
"House Wife" ('homemaker'). Bedroom communities connected to the city by a
system of roads and highways. Individuality consumed by a network that dreams
were built on. In one nightmarish flash the the connected (soo easy with AOL
52%(?!)of POP.) and a planned controlled world of entertainment news and e-com,
endless BBS and idled millions on chat and those multi colored plug and play
candy colored e-macs all in the row just like the GMs and candy colored (sexy)
Fords took the hopes of a progressively informed and enlightened world right out
of my head. What is this very disenchanting view that came into my head as I
watched the history channel program? Is it true? Is that what is going to be
left of our electronically infused happy and informed digitally augmented and
information rich privilaged world?  What can I do? I thought, artnatural.

Overspecialization is a method of closing minds and commodifying that which
should be natural.

Poetry on the web is a good place to start. It is just poetry but poetry as it
should be. Actively exchanged and not set in a publication.

Imagine the poems of each day spreading across the community like a mantra
pushing the consumer media jingos out of your mind. A daily cleansing of the
desiring mind. Like a refreshing shower in the morning. Poetry that alleviates
the anxieties of a wanting world whose utility of pleasure consumption is
increasingly the credit card number entry.

i was recently hired to teach a "reading/writing intensive" comp class
(community college level) where all essays are supposed to respond to a
piece of literature with an "urban focus" (we're in New York City), and
related materials dealing with that literature.  I'm thinking of teaching
Rez's Testimony -- if anyone has any experience teaching these books,
and/or has suggestions for easy-to-understand critical texts dealing with
_Testimony_, I'd really appreciate hearing about your
experiences.  Backchannel (if that is most appropriate) to

Saddened to hear that about Lita Hornick. I certainly
did not know her well, but her support of contemporary
poetry, publishing important books by Susan Howe, Ted
Greenwald, and others, was a major contribution.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

In an effort to connect the literary community with AIDS prevention and
awareness organizations, Teachers & Writers Collaborative, in conjunction
with Creative Time and Day Without Art Web Action, is embarking on a project
that will result in an on-line web page that echoes and expands upon
artist and writer Joe Brainard's book-length work "I Remember."

Brainard, who died of AIDS in 1994, was a brilliant and hilarious writer
who recorded more than a thousand of his memories in his book _I Remember_
(Penguin, 1995):

        I remember a boy named Henry who was said to have poured a mixture of
        orange pop and popcorn off the balcony of the "Ritz" movie theatre as he
        made gagging sounds..

        I remember that little jerk you give just before you fall asleep.  Like
        falling.

        I remember, at parties, after you've said all you can think of
        to say to a person--but there you both stand.

What T&W wants to do now is to encourage individuals from all around the
country -- including friends of Brainard's, people involved in AIDS
organizations, students, teachers, poets, writers, hospice-care workers,
and so on -- to write down their own "I Remembers" for inclusion in the
web page.

Submissions can be as long or short as you want -- they'll be edited and
placed in an order that allows each submission to interact and correspond
to other submissions in as lyrical and interesting a way as
possible.  This web page will be made available to the public on April 1,
the first day of National Poetry Month, but will not be limited to this
little window of time.

Your "I Remembers" can be about anything.  Here's an exercise that might
help you get started on your own "I Remember":

        1) Close your eyes and relax.  Take a deep breath, in and
out.  Let your mind go back to something you remember pretty well.

        2)  Let whatever you remember happen all over again in your
mind.  Notice as many details as you can.

        3)  Open your eyes and write down exactly what you just
remembered.  Begin your lines with the phrase "I remember..."

Send all submissions (and any questions you might have) to Daniel Kane at
dkane@panix.com.  Please include your full name and address so you can be
acknowledged.

Just a quick follow up:

Anselm notes that "Renny Pritikin (possibly misspelled by me) cited at a
certain point "the lack of commonterms" as the main reason for communication
breakdowns between Berrigan and, as it seemed, Bob Perelman and Barrett
Watten."  In fact, what was also largely at stake here was the inevitable
dialectic of change that constitutes the shifting hierarchical structure of
the cultural field (in other words, the breakdown in communications was *not*
some unfortunate misunderstanding but was intended as a direct challenge to
the cultural practice in which Berrigan had accumulated symbolic capital.
Since ideas were taken somewhat more seriously at this time, the poetry world
 wasn't able to accomodate the legitimacy of both the Lang Poets and the 2nd
gen NYS.  Again, the discourse of " poetic community" entirely conceals what
was essentialy a conflict of power).  Bourdieu writes:  "the process that
carries work along is the product of the struggle among agents who, as a
function of their position in the field, of their specific capital, have a
stake in conservation, that is routine routinization, or in subversion."

The reason the List carries so many mentions of the Lang Poets is an
extremely ironic one:  They stand in the way of the next generation, but, as
cultural values themselves don't matter really anymore (not as much as
symbolic capital does) the next generation cannot dispense w/ the Language
poets function to confer legitimization.  Emerging poets are thus caught in
the double bind evident in the Talisman anthology.

Hi Anselm,

(I believe I have successfully retracted a post (riddled w/ lazy errors) on
this same subject written last Fri. in response to Stephen Ellis-- so,
hopefully, I am not repeating myself here.)

First, let me try to say what is at stake when I talk about success in
relation to experimental poetry.  Obviously, I am not talking about economic
capital, even though this is in fact obtainable by a very small minority of
experimentalist poets in the form of grants (in the hundreds of thousands of
dollars) or in the sale of personal papers and correspondance (an unusual
example would be, say, Ginsberg's selling his papers to Columbia for a
million dollars).  But the fact that anyone reading this post would feel at
all uncomfortable with the idea of there being any possible financial
renumeration for  experimental writing would only demonstrate the extent to
which the game of poetry is one of *loser wins*.  It will always be an
*oppositional* game inasmuch as it functions by the *inversion* of the
principles organizing the business economy--in that cultural production
exists fundamentally as (when it is as severely restricted as exp poetry is)
a production for producers.  Which, however, is not to say that the world of
alternative poetry and the world of bussiness are not homologous.   The
alternative poetry world, whatever else it is, is a hierarchical social space
in which agents--poets-- employ various strategies--aesthetic practices--in
order to acquire symbolic capital--prestige--and power (of a certain kind).
Indeed, the power resulting from the acquisition of symbolic capital is the
very thing that legitimizes the authority of critical interpretations and
aesthetic judgments generally (and their reproduction through the efficacy of
institutional cultural authority in the form of the exp writing and
literature programs, organizations like St Marks, the most influential small
presses and magazines, and so on).  Success in poetry thus depends not as
much on intrinsic abilities and gifts (since aesthetic value is a social, not
a natural, creation) as on the extent of the poet's cultural capital--that
is, his or her sense of the state of the game as it being played *now*. It
goes without saying, however, that both poets and critics have, obviously, a
certain self-interest in disinterestedness--that is, a stake in a *belief*
concerning the absolute or autonomous aesthetic value of the work per se.

As for the term "conflict of values" which Stephen asked about last week, it
would implicate, of course, the various investments it is possible to make re
such issues as the nature of subjectivity (& its representation in poetry),
the objective character of language and its relationship to the world of
things, the connection of art to politics  (overt? covert? transcendental?),
etc.  But it is my impression that these conflicts no longer really *signify*
in the way they used to.  Open almost any alternative magazine and you will
find a bizarre mix of contradictory styles (each of which is subtended by
very different values).  The editorial stance of these magazines is, in
almost all cases, impossible to determine.  &  when--very rarely-- the editor
does (bravely) state her or his position, it is not unusual to find her/him
dissing the very kind of poetry he/she has been publishing all along, or that
the book reviews (if the magazine carries them) are extolling.  But this
isn't bad faith, so much as the implicit recognition that a gold standard for
aesthetic judgement and pleasure no longer exists.    As a result,
alternative poetry simply proliferates haphazardly in a state of (almost)
pure circulation (with the exception that as Warhol realized, fame
(contingent, stupid, indifferent) is the single most important point of
reference or criteria for aesthetic (or other) judgements).   It is thus
difficult to see how poetry can serve as an emancipatory or moralistic --or
politically oppositional--discourse.  Why, as Stephen again asked, are we
"ideologically blind" to this?  Because as Baudrillard puts it, "when things,
signs , or actions are freed from their respective ideas, concepts, values,
points of reference, origins, and aims, they embark upon an endless process
of self-reproduction. Yet things continue to function long after the ideas
have disappeared, and they do so in total indifference to their own content.
The paradoxical fact is that they function even better under these
circumstances."

Ted Berrigan is an exemplary case.  I am not at all surprised that, like
Bernstein, he also compared poetry to a small business.  In fact, Padgett, in
_TED_, if I remember it correctly, reveals him as being, for example, very
much concerned with his inclusion in the Norton Anthology.  But yes--I'd say
of course that, without any doubt, Ted Berrigan was a great success (measured
in terms of symbolic capital).  If his books went out of print, it is because
these were carried by commercial publishers (right?)--so he paid a certain
price in moving from an economy of  restricted production to one of a
slightly larger scale (but loser wins!).  Also, of course, he possessed an
extraordinary degree of cultural capital insamuch as he was at the center of
various avant-garde coteries--Warhol's Factory, the NY School, etc.--in which
a sense of the values at stake was somewhat arcane (circulating, as it did,
often in socially closed or private conditions).

Hi John,

You write:

   so then the question arises;  are those poems that just flow, seemingly
without resistance, not art ?  it wd seem that if i was in agreement with
the quotes that started this posting then i wd at least need to be pretty
suspicious about such a spontaneous and effortless work's art status, right
?

Yes, you can.  Suspicion is a good instinct to have.  But that suspicion can
be part of the "content," once it is accepted as a form of response, and
some art flies based on the level of suspicion it raises -- like Cage's.

I think your problem with what I have written, or with your use of what I
have written, seems to be that you are looking for some sort of dogma
supporting my sentence, but the sentence "resists" such reduction -- the
phrase "first note" tips you off to that, since it implies second or third
notes, or the provisionality of the experience (a "note" in this instance
being a lesser form of a "perception," which implies a truth content --
"note" is more aesthetic, Jamesian).  I didn't write that the "resistance of
the medium is a defining trait," that is obviously very oversimplified
(though Adorno's lovely essay on Valery, which I've mentioned before, is a
good read if you are interested in this issue).  My idea is that each
reader, or receptor, of a work of art has a series of expectations it, that
most of these people are not "ideal" readers who cater to the pleasures of
their suspicions, and that one can play off of these searches for the
"resistance of the medium as a defining trait" to create an engagement with
the reader.  Part of the reason I think some language poetry fails in terms
of this "reader created meaning" is that the terms of engagement are so much
a development of the poet's advanced views of literature (often based on a
counter-agonic constructivism, or a "pure" anti-subjectivity, or maybe
Cagein indeterminacy, all of which is so "right" to the poet that they can't
fathom the reader not seeing these things) and there is little attention
given to what might be called (with a nod to Rebecca Wolff) the "general"
understanding of poetry (which can involve the "resistances of its medium")
that the reader is often in the position of feeling quite put out by these
terms, or even worse, completely unengaged (hence with no sense of
anticipation of what a true "engagement" would feel like). It would be like
inviting someone to play on the seesaw with you, and then presenting them
with a geodesic dome -- the "modern" version whose utility in terms of
pleasure is not very apparent -- and saying "take a seat, swing your
legs" -- huh -- and then providing you with thousands of theories of
"tensegrity" and economies of matter and balances, etc -- huh, woah?  All of
which is right, and more interesting than general news, but engagement,
which needs some "organic" component, would probably not happen.  Well, I
don't know what I mean here, but you probably get the drift.

Anyway, this is what I wrote (quoted from your email):

    "Another way to phrase it, using the above terms, is that you would like
to spot the resistances in the work since it is that which gives you the
first note of understanding of why a work is "art" and not something like a
letter, or a call in the wild."

It's funny that you quote and then contort it into one extreme, so that you
can provide the opposite extreme.  In a way, I would say you didn't see the
"resistance" of my sentence, or the concept.

TIME MECHANIX 1
EDWARD DORN presented by Michael Barnholden
Tuesday February 1, 8 pm
Robson Central
750 Burrard (Mezzanine)
Vancouver BC

"With the death of Edward Dorn the United States loses not only one of
its finest poets but a rare critical intelligence and cultural
commentator." - Tom Raworth, The Independent, Dec. 16, 1999

Ed Dorn was a graduate of Black Mountain College (1955). Born in
Illinois, he worked in the Boeing plant in Seattle in the late forties
and returned to live and work in Washington state in the late fifties.
His novel Rites of Passage (aka By the Sound) portrays this period of
his life. His work was included in Donald Allen's The New American
Poetry (1960) and his first book was published by Totem Press (Leroy
Jones/Amiri Baraka) in 1961. In 1965 he collaborated with photographer
Leroy Lucas on The Shoshoneans: the People of the Basin Plateau. He
lived and taught in England in the late sixties, then in Chicago,
Mexico, San Francisco, Boulder, Montpellier. His best known work is the
epic Gunslinger. Other books include Geography, The North Atlantic
Turbine, Recollections of Gran Apacheria, Abhorrences. In the eighties,
with his wife Jennifer, he edited the tabloid Rolling Stock ("If it
moves, print it!"). He died on December 10, 1999 in Denver.

TIME MECHANIX will occur on the first Tuesday of each month at Robson
Central. On Tuesday March 7, Peter Quartermain will honour Basil
Bunting's centenary. On Tuesday April 4, Robyn Laba will read from
Muriel Rukeyser. On Tuesday May 2, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk will
reluctantly read Gertrude Stein. The series will continue in our Summer
season.

 "A poet is a time mechanic not an embalmer." - Jack Spicer

 "Since poets write backwards in response to their deceased poetic
 predecessors and forward to the eventual readers of their poems, they
 exist inevitably outside of their own time even as they reflect or
 embody it. Thus Spicer proposes that the poet is always posthumous in
 the act of composition - or outside the present of the poems - since the
 'afterlife of the poem' exists in a time beyond the life of the author."
 - Peter Gizzi

Hi Tony,

> "Reading all postings as offering "states of feeling", not a few seem keen
to assert some power over the discursive space, over listeners, -- sometimes
with sheer length, sometimes with judgements "supported" with argument of
(variable) cogency, sometimes with postings that seem to be demonstrations
of literary critical academic professionalism."

I fear the following may refer to me partly -- because I know I'm a
blabbermouth and probably post too much (I mean this) -- but I'd like to
know, in general, how this "power over discursive space" is enacted in
something with the structure of this list (which could, for example, have as
683 posts a day if those 683 Americans would post once daily, along with the
8 Australians etc. etc.), and how one is to satisfy one's demands for this
power even should that be his (in this case we would say "his") goal.  And
what's wrong with "demonstrations of literary academic professionalism" and
how does one suss this out?  What's wrong with arguments of "variable
cogency" if you are available to make them cogent, or to inject a new set of
insights to perhaps produce something new?

I guess the question is:

Are we to take no chances at all when trying to discover, or uncover, what
is the nature of poetry today, or who is writing interesting poetry and why,
or is one to adopt a "common sensical" approach, a conservative and not
unsettling manner that leaves us secure with our sense of "art" and one as
an individual is.  Are we always to refer to the "eternal verities" of
literary value, or do we try to see the future for what it's worth?

There seem to be three ways to read this list: 1) as individual emails, 2)
as a big "digest," and 3) on the web in the archives (my preferred method,
it saves you from the anxiety of having to read several emails or a long
one).  I'd be the first to draw back if I thought I was just crowding other
people out -- the effect would be most strong on the digest, I presume --
but I tend to think the forum is still open to contributions from anyone
reading the thing.

My sense is that, while some of the "threads" could be trimmed at the end,
just like any poem one writes (Schuyler used to say that he only cut off the
ends of his poems as revision, because they got pretty bad there), or even
starting from the middle, that most threads at least have some kernel of
value to them, and that it's unlikely a thread will be hot metal
intellectual discourse throughout, or "good poetry."  And since this is a
group effort by a bunch of people who don't know each other, we're not going
to come up with War and Peace.

[Start threads!]

If we choose to approach threads as involuntary geological formations, like
mountains, and appreciate the shapes they adopt rather than the "human"
content, it would enable one to appreciate all forms of "variably cogent"
behaviors therein.  At least that's the way I see it.

In any case, I wonder why there are so many people who are, in general, very
silent on the list, and the only time you hear from them is when they
suggest that the list is merely exposing how aggressive, hypocritical and
pretentious poets are.  Poets have to be pretentious -- just like Max Harris
(hurray!) -- it's their jobs!  I don't much care if people think I'm
pretentious.

If I may make a rather subversive comment: if you subtract all the loose
talk on this list, the pretension and so forth, you are left with a bunch of
magazine announcements and reading announcements -- which, when you think
about it, is really just the "voice of the art bureaucrat" -- which isn't to
say that that's what these people are by any means, they are often not
getting paid at all and put in long hours of work to keep these things
going, and they are often poets, very good ones!  I'm just suggesting that
the background hum this list performs would be reduced to that component,
and wouldn't have any chance of being enlivening.

Gustaf Sobin, who lives in Provence, France, and isnt around everyday;
he'll be reading at Diesel Bookstore in Oakland,      & later in Feb. a
Swiss film on Rimbaud that looks great, coming up at the Cinematheque--
your only chance to see this one.

cheers

ARTHUR RIMBAUD, A BIOGRAPHY (1991)
a film by Swiss filmmaker Richard Dindo
Sunday, Feb 20, 7:30 pm, $7/$4
presented by San Francisco Cinemateque
@ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 701 Mission St (at 3rd)

This film is unique in Dindo's oeuvre, for here he incorporates actors as
his witnesses to the life and death of the great poet.  We see and hear his
mother and sister, his school mentor, the poet and lover Verlaine, an
employer in Aden and a Swiss business associate speak of their
relationships with Rimbaud in the very places where they shared his life
(his home in Charleville, Paris, London, Marseille, Aden, Harare).  Rimbaud
himself is present only through the wound of his absence, made visible
through the images of the places he inhabited, the voices of those who knew
him, and excerpts from his poems and letters.

Richard Dindo appearing In Person

for details reply to:   sfc@sfcinematheque.org      telephone 415 558 8129

Presented as the 3rd program in the series
EXCAVATING SPACE TO REDEEM TIME:  THE FILMS OF RICHARD DINDO

"I don't try to immortalize the present, I try to draw memories into the
present.  Again and again my  films focus on people who are already dead=8A.
My films revolve around absence.  That is my subject" --Richard Dindo

The Cinematheque, in conjunction with Pro Helvetia, the Arts Council of
Switzerland, presents three recent films by Richard Dindo, Switzerland's
-and one of Europe's- best known documentary filmmakers.  Using testimony,
written or spoken, as his point of departure, his camera insistently
investigates and fixes the actual spaces of events, seeking invisible scars
to reveal and redeem a past now buried in the wake of time's passage.
Dindo has said that his films often focus on "politically committed people
and rebels who have experienced repeated defeats.  Grieving is an integral
part of remembering."  The three films selected here each focus on
extremely different figures,  each of whom lost a battle waged against an
unjust or repressive society: the Swiss police chief Gr=FCninger who saves a
number of Jews and is subsequently tried and condemned for his actions; the
revolutionary Che Guevara who returns to Bolivia to fight his last guerilla
war; and the po=E8te maudit Arthur Rimbaud who rejects his family, the socia=
l
order, and ultimately his own writing and Europe.  Dindo will be present at
the screenings on Thursday Feb 17 and Sunday Feb 20 and there will be a
reception following the Feb 17 screening.

the puns & sound-rimes on "Maldoror" are endless -- I first heard it as
"mal d'aurore" "in lack of dawn" or needing a dawn --
there is also the whole aura/air / or=gold/ etc. which I played with many
years ago in a section of my poem _The Book of Luap Nalec_

& then you could also hear horror, odor, sleep etc. in the word.

Hi there.

_in the end will be the flesh and the flesh will be made word_

I have authored a web site, called "p r o x i m a t e . o r g" that
you may find of interest. Please take a stroll down the gallery path.
The site is a home for my internet-related poetry and graphic
design.

http://proximate.org/


WHAT THE NAME

The site is named 'proximate' as a nod to the concept of proxemics in
human communication. Proximate communications, specifically oral
communications, contain extralinguistic information, _e.g._, body
language & context, that remote communications such as recordings
or textual communications do not have, cannot have. The hope of
the internet as some sort of transcendent medium deserves serious
skepticism when placed in such a light. Such a light also gives us
opportunity for discovering the positive. There's always the
tension, the conflict.

The name "proximate" is also a pun on intimacy on the
internet, as in a proxy mate. We all know sex sells, _especially_
on the internet. The internet seems to be used as a proxy for
human contact and proximal communication, which gives
me pause. Such an intuition adds to what I sense as a sort of
growing desperation for real, physical human contact,
particularly in America, with everyone working on him- or herself,
never time for affection, only time for status, career, a new
car.  Such use of energy may be at odds with a more positive
force in life.  The world has some strange dynamic property to
it; there's something beyond our knowledge, yet within, around;
perhaps such a thing helps explain the necessity for contact.
The internet is often used as a substitute for that contact,
but it can't do that well.  There is NO substitute.  The "i" that the
pun pivots on is relevant to a constant concern throughout the
site regarding identity. "I"? Y?


WHY THE SITE

I have authored this site as a byproduct of discussions I have had
regarding the internet, interface design and human gesture, the
pretensions of proximity in web pages and the actual distances
constructed by them, and some resulting poetry. Most of the
discussions were this past summer and autumn through subsubpoetics
(an e-mail list started by Jordan Davis) with Alan Sondheim and
two close friends, one a writer, the other a designer.
(Some material from these dialogues can be found at another web site:
http://gesture.org/text.html .)  I am interested precisely in the type
of relationships that web pages build between people. I have
observed that this internet aesthetic, this relater, is a duplicitous
one (getting  back to the original definition of art?) -- that the
writing styles typical of e-talk and the "personalization"
of web pages add up to make a user feel close, proximate,
A SOMEBODY, while all along  the relationship is constructed
at an  incalculably great distance.  Such a great distance, that it
allows the person or persons constructing the content, who is
trying to get your attention or most likely your money, to
completely disregard those at the receiving end of the
communication.  Like the power of a bomb; you can destroy
people and not even have to suffer through witnessing it.

This web site appears in lieu of a book. Besides, such material would
make little or no sense _only_  in print.  Of course, publishing the
work on the internet pretty much guaranteed the publication.  Makes
it easier to work from outside the system as well.

p r o x i m a t e tries to imitate this confrontational, faux-personal
aspect of the internet in ludicrous ways, in some poems ("Come Closer!,"
"Simon Says," etc.) . Other poems engage a more sincere aspect, such as
the relation between nature and the binary of computing, or my creeping
suspicion that web pages are multiplying in the fashion of A.M. country
stations, albeit at a greater rate, thus undermining this "personalized"
bright future the internet is supposed to provide.  All web pages
seem the same after a while. I am primarily interested here in
confrontation and the language unit of the sentence and the chord
structures of poems (as I mis/read Ashbery), as opposed to the
syllable, the notes of poems.

I have a strong interest in interface design, as interfaces on the
internet (or in all technologies, even writing?) are the starting points
for my discussion, as interfaces are the most immediate contact we
have with others, though letters and graphics and hypertext links.


HOW THE SITE


p r o x i m a t e  is linear, as I wanted the site to feel
less like a "Choose your own Adventure" book and more like
a neglected side hallway in an old art gallery space.  The site
contains several poems, including 2 kinetic poems, a few
RealAudio recordings of readings with some background
processing in some cases, some original graphics, and some
groundwork for new interfaces (which are now static).
Perhaps the structure is a gesture of my sincerity, as
the face of much of the material is one of sarcasm
and duplicity (multiplicity?).  I felt I could point out
internet-style duplicity by exaggerating it.

Of course, without the internet, this work would be meaningless.
The internet has afforded me the opportunity to publish in such a
fashion.  As much as I criticize the Internet, I cannot imagine
a time or place in the past where a maturing writer could develop
in a fashion that is at once independent and public.  Proximal and
distal.  For  this I am not only fortunate but grateful.

With this site I have something at stake, both as a poet and as a
professional web designer & developer. The job pays my bills,
the poetry inflates my lungs, but I wanted something devoid of such a
feeble opposition, a place where the two could meet. The result is
p r o x i m a t e . o r g .

WHAT THE SITE: A COMPLETE GUIDE

The site proceeds linearly in the following fashion, though you can
also start at the home page and click through it (as of 20 January
2000):

http://proximate.org/ -- main page. Simple GIF animation.  The
hand (also see below) is known as, "La Mano Poderosa," or the
All-Powerful Hand.  It is a Caban-style sculpture from 19th C.
Puerto Rico.  Is the hand all-powerful?  The hand has become a
focal point for gesture, as communication with all its powerful
extralinguistic content is trying to get through the hands, the
fingers, through the keyboard.

To this page I just added a flash piece called "Hello," which is
properly reached from a link below the main graphic on this
page.  The image of the abbot is Saint Benedict, who allegedly
could read minds and dispense a large set of rules.  He helped
change Western European languages while proselytizing across
the continent in the 6 th century.  He is the patron saint in effigy
and he is dying to shake your hand.  Like agents of the lord, people
are milling about proselytizing about the internet and its divine
glories in almost religious fervor.  And certainly language is
changing as a result. Remember, 01 is me and I am 01.  Dust
& ash serve as analog counterpoint. The music is a short
composition of mine.  The flash animation requires Flash 4.

http://proximate.org/closer.htm & http://proximate.org/closer2.htm -
"Come Closer!," a kinetic poem about getting close to a web page. GIF
animation.

http://proximate.org/hands.htm -- hands (future interface groundwork).
The hand and the eye are the human part of the interface of the
internet.  But each finger has its own spiritual power, and
together . . . .

http://proximate.org/01d3c0d3.htm -- "01 d3c0d3," a poem. (I decode).
This poem is about interface, whether it be a keyboard or a language
or a literary device or a counting system. Something gets filtered out,
yet something else gets added. the impoverished signal gets a boost
somewhere. I try to add to that filter, by means of adding subliminal
(nonliminal?) suggestions to the noise, as an attempt to develop
unconscious coloring constituents for meaning, as if meaning were
not a point but a field, a cloud. But when pushed for something better,
all means of communication break down, becoming noisy yet
reductive, insular. Where does something go when it is expressed?
Where do we go when we express ourselves? Poetry seems to be
cryptic sometimes, and in the crypt, is something lost, or is something
gained, or both? We live in an age of cryptography, seemingly
disparate  subjects suddenly thrust upon each other. Can anything be
expressed in language or any other code?  Hence my reason for
changing the "I" to  "01," seemingly appropriate for a binary age.

http://proximate.org/catching.htm -- graphics with a tribute to Vito
Acconci, perhaps the most important influence on this site, at least
from an ideological / aesthetic standpoint. the picture is of Vito
Acconci trying to catch balls thrown at him while he is blindfolded.
It's funny and yet it's not. It's other-sensory, synecdochal (to coin
a word), and oddly harrowing. Like understanding art itself. The
Chinese text is from a "Reelect Willie Brown" web page. I thought
it was ironic without translation and even more ironic if the text is
understood.

http://proximate.org/image.htm -- "image," a poem for Alan Sondheim.
This poem is about the technology of writing and its relation to
orality. And the internet and its magnification of aspects of the
technology of the written word. Echoes of Plato, Walter Ong,
Julian Jaynes, Coleridge, _Max und Moritz_. T.S. Eliot,
interface, the augury underlying not only science but _intent_
altogether. With accompanying RealAudio voice morphing at
http://proximate.org/ra/image.ram .

http://proximate.org/morph.htm - "Friends Forever!!!." A web page
getting friendly, but it just _might_ be insincere.

http://proximate.org/simon.htm - "Simon Says!", a confrontational poem
_a la_ Acconci's way of forcing an audience's involvement by
using the second person. the graphics are a reflection of
reflections and dissected sexuality. Typography tries to merge the
sense of language with mathematics, providing its own means
for alienation. A poem originally composed for subsubpoetics.

http://proximate.org/confluent.htm - A well-known poet told me
last year that I needed to write a nature poem.  I do not think this
is what he had in mind. I attempt to express timelessness with a most
deliberate conflation of distant origins and the commonplace
results of today, machines spitting numbers. And this conflation came
out somewhat like Glossolalia, like speaking in tongues, only more
clear, like Tourette's, but not abusive. My fascination with cosmology
and astronomy bubbles through the lines but always at the strain of
admitting such things as black holes, the strain of admitting the
reality of anything, or the construction of anything for that matter.
With a RealMedia recording, morphed voice and risset tones:
http://proximate.org/ra/confluent.rmm .

http://proximate.org/asabove.htm - "As Above, So Below." GIF image.
Another interface precursor. Overly simple perhaps, but it is also a
joke on interface and even perhaps the sortilege of sexuality, like
knowing which way to go at the appearance of a subway sign that
says "Street (up arrow), subways (down arrow)." You always know
which way to go just by merit of where you are. The sign is
unnecessary. The image, to add to the entendre, is an altered
detail from a large public works mural done by the fantastic
brilliant realist artist, Jack Beal. I believe the mural is the mosaic
in  the 42nd Street Subway Station in NYC. Jack is a dear
friend of a dear friend, and this mutual dear friend is the
stepfather of my best friend who died three years ago. The
experience of his son's death is a large part of why I'm doing
ANYTHING creative today. To bring  this in line with the
image, the detail from this mosaic is of my friend's stepfather,
who Beal actually pictured as a welder in the mosaic. Perhaps
the internet is a subway, and to make navigating it simple,
know where you are and have a pretty good idea of where
you'd like to go. And what if you don't know where you are?

http://proximate.org/subterra.htm - A poem entitled, "Subterranean
Homesick Filament," with original graphics. The poem originally appeared
on subsubpoetics and was written by replacing every 'a' with a 4, every
'e' with a 3, every 'i' with a 1, every 'o' with a 0, every 'g' with
a 9, and some other textual substitutions as well. This poem
is perhaps more sincere than the other content, perhaps more
mundane and commonplace, but all such things should have a
home. The empty feeling from working too much, being too
deeply immersed in the mercantile world, and the effect of such
feelings of emptiness on one particular personal relationship,
my most important relationship.

http://www.proximate.org/paradigm.htm - "Paradigm Shift." A poem about
web pages as miscellaneous and vapid as country stations in a violent
cowboy world soldiered by people in briefcases. The distance of web
pages, the desperate need of people for touch, and the outlandish
appeals for subjugation and abuse all over the internet -- all such
things play a part. Perhaps because all of that time on the internet
we are sitting in front of a lifeless monitor. Human contact is so hard
to find, and just a little more difficult on the internet. It's as if
making a bigger noise on the internet will finally bring the touch,
but at that  point you're already sucked in. And you are more
easily commodified at that point. I guess I'm pretty much an
vitalist, by way of Wilhelm Reich or Bergson, so my concerns
with the technology of text, of internet, or ideas without
flesh, distant media like big brothers, are all in conflict with
the great deal of  fondness I have for both writing and the
internet.  And I'm curious here about the rise and fall of the
sentence, how syntax is like the chord structure of a song.
Hence the unresolved sentence to introduce, and its repetition as
an opportunity for resolution.  A RealMedia recording accompanies
the poem at http://proximate.org/ra/paradigm.rmm .

http://proximate.org/lockandkey.htm - "Lock and Key." Poem with
original graphics. Keys, encryption, gestures of openness and
penetration/interface, the divisiveness of objectification, the gestures
of body language blown apart, and the age-old philosophical riddle of
other minds.

http://www.proximate.org/syntax.htm - "Syntax Round." Poem with original
graphics. What does a page when designed for a print layout, look like
on the web? Again, another poem that plays on syntax and its
relation to resolution via the avoidance of resolution and repetition.
Free jazz is a big influence on much of my writing, not just here,
and it has led me to some level of insight on the sentence and its
music.   An insight perhaps or an opportunity for an invented
intellection. A sentence in language is used here in a way
equivalent to a phrase of music in a song. And on the graphical
design side of things, here's an attempt to see what a page spread
layout designed for print would look like on a web page, and
the art work, again, indulging in the compulsion of most literal
interface, the display of genitalia. We humans have more in
common with chimps than we like to kid ourselves. Commercial
internet enterprises take advantage of our primate nature as well
as our seeming ignorance of such a nature, all over the place. Sex
sites in particular.

http://www.proximate.org/bookends.htm - "Bookends Person Absurdities."
This poem was the result of a Sunday trip to the library. The opening
section is composed of the first and last sentences of books I picked up
at the library, but when I rewrote them I stripped of any people.
And then I incorporated the credits for each book as part of the work.
The measure of the line here is in words, not syllables. The unit of the
sentence takes primacy here. The "notes" section is a more personal
accounting of some things that I was rubbing up against. I guess I
read Walt Whitman poems now as if John Giorno were trying to read
them, not allowing a breath until the line is completed. Allen
Ginsburg haunts this, perhaps even my reading of it (RealMedia) at
http://proximate.org/ra/bookends.rmm . Yes, this is my voice
unretouched. At some point the authentic must appear, no matter
how futile in theory.

http://proximate.org/blackbox.htm - "The Black Box is Empty." A
villanelle, with artwork. Unfortunately I cannot remember the source of
the photograph. So someone is going uncredited here. Are poems part
of signs? What's that monkey doing there?

http://proximate.org/creation.htm - A visual allusion to Linda Nochlin's
"The Origin without an Original"* and Gustave Courbet's "L'origine du
Monde" and to the collapse of the end into the origin in the great
cosmological cycle of things. Authenticity and a lack thereof. A return
to the beginning, if you touch it, baby, c'mon. This woman, unlike
Courbet's subject, is not an object but an activity, an explosion, a
channeling, an interfacing. Orgasm as interface, transformation, both
familiar and other-worldly.

Starting with an end and ending with an origin.


THANKS

Enjoy. I would love your feedback, especially if you have made it
this far along. Most of this material was posted to the domain server
during the week beginning 16 January 2000, and is still in development.
There is much more to come, both poetry and interface design.

My thanks go to Alan Sondheim, Giles Hendrix, and Suzie Sisoler for
their valuable insights and comments generously given to me during
the development of the p r o x i m a t e site. And to Janet, for
not just tolerating but appreciating my absences from working too
much.

Thank you.

Warmest regards,
Patrick Herron

I'm trying to put a class together that looks at "documentary" poems. The
first thing that comes to mind is Reznikoff's _Testimony_. Also Rukeyser's
"Book of the Dead." I'd like to generate a list of poems (particularly
contemporary ones) that might fall into this category. Any suggestions?

Dear Daniel K:
I've never taught Reznikoff, but I've read a great deal and sense an almost
tactile contact within those spaces he witnessed. But I suggest, as a
possibility, the recreation of some of his walks. I don't know if you are
familiar with the "Re-Photography" project in the West where contemporary
photographers (Mark Klett, Bob Dawson among others) have revisited and
rephotographed the sites of the great nineteenth century photographs
(WilliamJackson, Timothy Sullivan, etc.). As you can imagine the results can
be quite ironic. A reservoir (where there was once none) with a yacht and
cocktail glass on the table in the cockpit.  But I suspect you could do
similar "walking" revisitations with students and enact writing exercises in
Reznikoff's terrain.
I would envy the possibility to do so.  Good luck.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Subject:      Re: Utopias
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Thanks very much to folks who've posted regarding Utopias. When I was
formulating the question, I was trying to pinpoint places where poets have
explicitly invoked the rhetoric of Utopia from other places (the
political, psychoanalytic, and so on.)

Naomi Jacobs responded backchannel with an interesting collection of
names which she had taken from a list by Libby Falk Jones:

Piercy, "Outcome of the Matter:  The Sun"
Yeats, "The Second Coming"
Stafford, "What If We Were ALone?"
Eleanor Arnason, "The Land of Ordinary People"
cummings, "pity this busy monster, manunkind"
Cavafy, "Waiting for the Barbarians"
Olds, "Son" (from The Dead and the Living)
Strand, "Always"


Interestingly, right after posting the original message to the list, I
hoped on a bus up to Montreal to see an old friend; for whatever reason,
I've never run into as much Utopian rhetoric as I did in the few days I
spent up there. One of the things that struck me was the general scariness
of the various ideologues that were running around; much of the dialogue
goes on in a sort of environmentalism meets logical positivism zone where
a component of mysticism is admixed with a general desire to put things on
a "rational" basis.

It seems that poetry can hold a number of relationships to the idea of
Utopia, and that more interesting than the particular social vision
espoused is the depiction of the three point relationship between speaker,
audience and this nebulous zone that is conjured up by the word "Utopia",
not entirely conventional but not immediately new either.

If a poem gains its power from operating in a position of dissent within a
particular "structure" -- OK, political, but also generally cognitive,
meaning "making it new" is more than a aconsequential activity of the mind
alone -- what is going on when a poem tries to inhabit, describe, gesture
towards a Utopia where being in dissent is -- ? what ? -- coopted?

Dystopias are another matter, of course; there are interesting questions
there, but I'm not sure that they drive as close to the strangeness of a
poem that enters a Utopia and in some way leaves behind the awareness of
its own ability to be "in dissent". You can be a poet gesturing towards
Utopia, of course, which is a dissenting position in as much as the poem
understands itself as being in the non-Utopian world. But what happens
when the poem claims to be written in or out of Utopia, and where it
envisages its audience as similarly unestranged?

Cranky morning state of feeling.

A long post is often boring. But is it really an act of aggression?
Equivalent to, say, a physical menace?

Literary-critical, academic, professional: I myself am all these things.
Used as put-downs, they too signify the attempt to superiorize oneself.
Yet I don't know that I feel menaced by capital-P Power here.

Hi all,

Those of you who happened to catch William Finnegan's article in the NYer
(last weeks? this weeks?) about slavery in Mauritania and the Sudan might
want to check out the website for the American Anti-Slavery Group:

 http://www.anti-slavery.org.

This is already a pretty well-organized effort, w/ members of Congress on
board (including the incomparably wonderful Barney Frank) but they of
course need grass-roots support and money to get anything substantive
accomplished.  The website details the mission, and has mucg useful
information, plus a petition (signed by Amiri Baraka among other
notables!), etc. Check it out!


-Mike.

ps: this has everything to do with poetry...

All,

I've been cogitating on the discussions here and elsewhere regarding the
shape of the virtual space, and I'm curious not so much as to how it
*should* be conceptualized, nor as to developing a working theoretical
paradgm, but how individuals wrap their brains around it.

To eschew obfuscation:  when you finish composing an email (to this list,
or otherwise...and is it different in either case), what is you personal
conception of the *where* where it goes upon executing "Send"?

The second thing I'm interested in involves the flipside of space, time.  I
have read that, in general, humans visualize time such that the individual
is facing the future, standing in the present, with the past behind them.
Why this way?  Isn't it just as logical to visualize time in the reverse:
The past in front of us, because we can *see* it via our memories, standing
in the present, the unknown future behind us and out of visual range?

Most english speakers are said to view time in some sort of discrete
increment linear scheme--frames of a film, bottles of beer on the wall,
hash marks on a ruler...visualizing time *as* space.   Some other languages
do not have this side-effect.  As language and usage change to adapt to the
virtual space, will this can this does this affect the visualization of
time?

My computer is online 24/7 and I stay connected to a private chat server
that I share with a circle of close friends that have become globally
scattered.  You type something and maybe they all are they, maybe none of
them are there.  3 days later you might get an answer to a question that
spawned other questions that have already been answered.  I used to have
the chat program timestamp other people's messages, so that when I went to
review what had happened in the hours I was not physically present, I could
guage the time during which it all occurred.  The whole scenario is so
necessarily nonlinear, that I realized the timestamping was ridiculously
useless.

15 minutes has always been a quarter circle to me, 20 minutes one third.
This will surely disappear when analog clocks are gone.  The calendar is
also a kind of circle to me.  The month I'm in is largest, and the ring
spreads out to my left and right, distorted a bit in shape--months
immediately ahead tilted up-ish, months just past tilted down-ish, such
that they meet again at the horizon of six months from now.  The seasons
are roughly superimposed on this ring (if I need to reference them) with
something that I always thought was color, but at this exact moment of
articulating the visualization I realize it is not.  Inexpressable...for
now.  Anyway,

How do each of you "see" time?  Does it have a shape, and if so what is
that shape?  If not, are there words to describe what you "see"?  Can it
does it change?

Thanks in advance for any replies,

Dan

 "A poet is a time mechanic not an embalmer." - Jack Spicer

 "Since poets write backwards in response to their deceased poetic
 predecessors and forward to the eventual readers of their poems, they
 exist inevitably outside of their own time even as they reflect or
 embody it. Thus Spicer proposes that the poet is always posthumous in
 the act of composition - or outside the present of the poems - since the
 'afterlife of the poem' exists in a time beyond the life of the author."
 - Peter Gizzi

I was thinking about this issue of the poet in time when I came across
these quotes in a posting by Aaron V.  The example I had in mind was
Barbara Guest, a poet that I only really discovered (for myself) about 5
years ago.  Here is my time-line:

1920:  Barbara Guest is born 1960:  Guest publishes first book in small,
coterie edition. (Jonathan Mayhew) is born. 1962:  Guest publishes 2nd
book with Doubleday.  She turns 42.  1966:  Frank O'Hara dies at age 40.
Jack Spicer also dies around the middle of this decade.

 1970s:  Guest continues to publish, now in smaller presses.  John Ashbery
wins all the awards for his Self-Portrait. The other New York school poets
also gain in recognition (Koch, Schuyler, O'Hara (posthumously). I read
all these poets with great interest, not thinking much about Guest, whose
books I have never seen in any bookstore, not in Norton anthology, etc...

1980s: Guest's H.D. biography. Desultory publication of her poetry in
smaller editions. Toward the end of the decade Guest is taken up by Sun &
Moon Press. Read by the same people who read other books published by
Messerli.

1990s:  Guest comes into her own--in terms of audience and critical
recognition, though there are still only 6 items in MLA bibliography in
the year 2000. I buy her selected poems in 1995:  the first book of hers I
have possessed, though I own more than 200 books by poets of the "New York
School."

2000:  I will turn 40. Guest will turn 80. The work produced in her 80th
decade has been extraordinary.  I have not yet published a book of poetry
but I still feel youthful.  I read a poem/story in Guest's Confetti Tales
called "Ars longa," about an aging actress under the harsh lights of a
movie camera...

Subject:      Cyberpoetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

If we have learned anything as human beings these past few generations,
it's that differences make life interesting.  Cyberpoetry should be as
diverse as our ecclectic tastes.   These days we know more about the
esoteric rituals of a Yao shaman than we do about those of our friends
(giving rise, perhaps, to the wishful thinking of the horror genre: "I
Married a Vampire").  This is not to classify cyberpoetry with scary
movies, but rather, to point out that we seem to be fascinated with the
different, the unknown. And what could be more fascinating than expressing
it in a language of transition and device.

For the machine which sits before me has evolved in a miraculous way.  By
using different programs the cyberpoet molds and modifies the "voice" to
mark poetic space, somewhat in the way Ducasse used Lautreamont to produce
Maldoror. For what is a pseudonym if not a mask.  What is a mask if not a
device for unfettered communication.  Is the webpage, therefore, the mask
of the cyberpoet?

The structure of the communication is certainly ritualistic. One must be a
member of the group: ie own an internet account.  One must access the
information through a prescribed process: opening the browser. One must
know how find the information: initiation.  One must perform the ritual to
gain the secrets that are gradually revealed: clicking, clicking, clicking,
moving in deeper and deeper as a relationship develops between the
cyberpoet and the viewer/reader.  That relationship is symbolized and
reconfirmed with the joining of a list and the creation of one's own
cyberpoetry page.

Perhaps it is this aspect/ this process of revealed knowlege that is most
disturbing in some cyberpoetry sites I have explored.  Those sites are not
films, once seen, then forgotten.  They represent an interactive education
in a poetic space.  This, educative aspect of cyberpoetry brings to the
forefront a question of ethics.  Do we really know what we are doing out
there?  Do we understand the relationship between the screen, the eye, the
mind and the heart?

Nineteenth century preoccupation with the fantastic developed as we began
to define the limits of our physical world.  Perhaps we are curently, in
fact, seeking to define the limits of the fantastic world.  The life of the
mind in cyberspace is certainly in this domain.  This is the space into
which we poets have ventured in our role as mentors of the human spirit. I
hope it maintains a balanced representation.

Jacques sayeth:


The reason the List carries so many mentions of the Lang Poets is an
extremely ironic one:  They stand in the way of the next generation,

and also:

  Again, the discourse of " poetic community" entirely conceals what
was essentialy a conflict of power).


*********************************

This is Jacques' hangup, but not exactly objective truth.  Indeed, we
might better understand Jacques' recent position in poetics debates, as
that of "the Nonmainstream Harold Bloom."  His primary understanding of
how US poetry works, is the idea that it is a power struggle.  The wish to
publish, or be read, to build poetic communities, are all dismissed as a
"will to power," in a highly simplified, subNietzschean model much like
Bloom's.

This, like Bloom's model, and like many large explanatory models that take
their structure from psychoanalytic ideas (the son must defeat the father,
etc.) cannot really be arguned or debated;  it can no more be disproven
than it can be confirmed.  It represents a personal mindset.... To
Jacques, apparently, everything poets do *feels* like a competitive
zero-sum struggle for power and "cultural capital."

But to actual poets, actually engaging in their work, and to readers of
poetry who respond to it, this is not what's going on.  It is going on in
Jacques's head;  i understand that.  But it is not in fact going on in the
world (any more than Bloom's similar lurid scenario of oedipal struggle
is).

THIS IS A LONG POST
        it lists problems i have heard expressed re the poetics list
        it tries to construct (problematically i'm sure) an empathetic take
on possible sides to some of these problems
        it ends with various proposals for ways that the problems might be
dealt with



        Problems

* there have been numerous mentions of postings being too lengthy (i'm a
culprit i confess)
* people have expressed the feeling that an overwhelming argument or debate
norm in certain threads has made them uninterested in joining in (that
thread became battle zones etc)
* c. daly wrote (hi catherine) that she took seriously the idea that the
list was for announcements and such
* and the quite old (as i see looking at _poetics@_) thread concerning the
lack of balance between the genders in postings

as i've heard all of these things stated in varied ways ranging from
resigned acceptance to angry indignation, and as i've seen evidence that
versions of these problems have a lengthy history on this list, i wd like to
think that, in spite of past discussions and the continuation of these
troubles, that there might be something that cd be done about still

(some thoughts on)

        Length

i do understand that this is a problem
        people have limited time, they read the list at work, they feel that
long posts require more effort to respond to than they have or want to
spend, they get the digest version and resent scrolling endlessly thru
things that don't interest them, they feel that long posts express an overt
or covert intent to dominate or control the discussion, they feel squeezed
out maybe, they certainly have many more ways of stating their problem(s)
with long postings that i will think of here and all of them will be real
problems
        now speaking as a "long poster" i find that much of what is the most
interesting on the list is delivered in long posts, it seems to me that a
~dichten/condensare~ attitude has as many drawbacks as advantages and that
depending on one's passions (poetic?) it cd be seriously debilitating
        thus the paradoxical aspects of the golden rule come to the fore

        Conflicts

this problem is linked to the last of course but certainly rates it own
heading
        what i've gleaned, partial as it may be, from posts to the list and
backchannel discussion of the list is that many aren't interested in any way
in polemics, in arguing, disputing ---- they wd like to see opinions of/on
and responses to poetry posted but don't wish to feel attacked or forced to
"justify" their opinions in public forum ---- or they wdnt mind at all
pursuing differences of opinion or understanding but based on prior
experience or observation of list dynamics they don't trust that personal
attacks and struggles to have the final word about things wont derail the
more, peaceful (?) pursuit of inquiry
        there are also those for whom debate and or argument are useful ways
of finding out not just what others think about things but about their own
feelings as well ---- i hope that these folks don't actually relish the air
battles that develop in "poetic space" ---- i do not, while i accept that i
have contributed to such, or perhaps, more to the point, have failed ~not
to~ ---- on this side of the impulse (which does often hoists itself on
conflictual postings) i think there is also at times a sense that those who
wish to be able to not have to expand upon or be asked to expand upon their
opinions or relate them to the opinions of others, are in some sense
refusing or shutting down the potential for open inquiry

        the Announcements list

all that i have to say about this is that while i value the announcements
and read many of them, that if this list truly is, first and foremost, an
announcements list, then i'm bored ---- the interest that reading _poetics@_
provides me has nothing to do with the announcements element of this list
and i cannot help but thinking that the it is the discussions of issues of
poetry and poetics and any number of other issues of whatever tangential
relation to these that makes this list and exciting place to be

        Gender imbalance

i dont think that i have anything to say about this that hasnt been said
more cogently by others many times in the past and so have nothing to offer
but my wish that more women wd feel like posting

(10 proposals, undoubtedly of things that have been suggested, unbeknownst
to me, in the past)

1. (this idea suggested to me yesterday) --- what if, as i have seen on
other lists, long posts started out with something akin to an "executive
summary" to allow a listee to scan a paragraph or outline or whatever and
decide whether they wanted to continue

2. for those who receive the list on an account also used for work (or
perhaps they take the digest b/c of this) it may be that yr email program
allows you to route anything from poetics@blahblah to a specific folder so
that it doesnt clog yr inbox obscuring work or other email --- and further,
might it be useful to get a free account from yahoo or hotmail or something
to use solely for the poetics list, in which case you wd be able to take the
list daily and not on digest with the added benefit of being able to delete
posts without reading them at all (say long posts from me?)

3. that "long posts" identify themselves as such at the head

4. that posters replying on list to one or more other individuals CC their
replies to these folks at the same
time that mail to the list so that threads might not be dragged out quite so
much

5. that when a topic or thread becomes either too conflictual or begins to
be the predominate thread for days on end that someone take the initiative
and either a) set up a list thru one of the many free list services
available to pursue that topic, or b) [on a small, maybe simpler scale] ask
who wd like to be a part of further discussion of it and set up a
distribution list and rely on the "reply all" function ---- then should
these things take off perhaps reinviting anyone from the list to join ----
and perhaps a short lived grouping of this sort might be able to present an
edited version of the discussion for anyone outside of it who's interested
or even figure a way to bring such a summary back to the list to see where
it might lead

6. that as conflictual posts begin to proliferate, participants all try to
maintain some backchannel contact with each other and if battling must be
done try to get it started and finished backchannel so that the list not be
the site of such air battles (i say this as i've noted sometimes that i'll
see a post on the list that seems as if designed to cause a fight and then
when i've backchannelled with the poster it turns out that such either wasnt
the case or was an unintended or regretted consequence)

7. that posters involved in threads which either are or seem potentially to
be conflictual *not* immediately post their response to these threads to the
list, instead, perhaps letting them sit for a day or until at least some
hours have passed when a rereading might save one from the ill effects of
"shooting from the hip"

8. that those who don't wish to be drawn into argument or debate about their
opinions but wd like to be able to express them, make that desire explicit
in their postings

9. (this may be a nightmare for the list administration, but i gotta suggest
it anyway) that the list be split --- i'm thinking of a work related list
serve that i'm on which actually comprises 4 parts so that one can subscribe
to any combination of them ---- the way this one is set up there is one for
"discussion" another for "programs" a third for "jobs" and a 4th which is
something of a catch-all for anything that didnt fit in the others (and so
might feature notices about books relevant to the field or posts from folks
looking for roommates at conferences etc)
        so for the poetics list might this break into poetics-discussion,
announcements, and poems ?  there is an injunction on this multi-list entity
that i spoke of that people not respond on list to announcements but only
send questions to the poster of the announcement ---- there wd of course be
bleedover as poets seem to be an unruly lot but i still feel that idea has
some merits

10. that any one on this list who feels excluded in some way by what we all
know to be a predominance of White Male Het Wasps please try, perhaps for
the umpteenth time, to discuss this feeling and what might be done be any
and all to address it



(i know that my own limitations in empathy and blindnesses to the
consequences of these problems will have produced distortions of them for
many of you reading this --- i apologize for that and wd appreciate any
broadening of my understanding that you might have to offer whether front or
backchannel)

( (  (   in particular brian stefans


brian, (and taylor or rather the person taylor is quoted that i in turn
cited)

my intention in the post "The Resistance" wasn't to pin the authors of the
quotes i started with to these things as "positions" much less "dogmas" ----
i simply noted that, what to my eye was a similar or related notion was
suggested in the two quotes and to explore what i thought about that notion

i might not have even registered it at all were it not such a commonplace,
and one that i've always had a bundle of different reactions to

brian, you chide me for overinterpretting or for a too simplistic reading of
what you wrote and for missing the consequences of the fact that you do say
"a first note" or something like that ---- that's fine with me, but at the
same time i cd easily imagine that "note" might have a presumed
"truth-content" and that "perception" not ---- say in the following two
statements ---- "note that i did offer any number of conditionals"  "that
was my perception of your statement" ---- but thanx for clarifying yr
intended use of "note" ---- i will try to read it, at least in yr postings,
in that light

but perhaps brian, you too missed certain clues in my post ?   my noting
that i wasn't sure that i was reading the quotes 'correctly' or 'as
intended' ---- and that i made a specific shift of the address to the whole
of the list and away from you and taylor's quoted poet ---- that i noted a
(to me) similar notion from a cage anecdote ---- that i referred to the idea
that i was getting from the two opening lines as fascinating, a description
that still holds --- that i acknowledged that i too have found myself
working with the idea that resistance might be central to the work ? ? ?

whatever the case, i can understand why you wd feel i was reacting to you
---- yet i feel as if i was, instead, looking to see what i thought about an
idea that i still believe is rather widespread and which stated negatively
might sound like any of the following "too easy" "anybody cd do that" or a
funny one that i recall from a record review 10 or more years ago, the
reviewer called the guitar stylings of greg ginn "free form musical
masturbation" ---- and which stated positively or perhaps simply oriented
toward the future might go "art doesnt happen it must be made" or "the art
work is the result of a successful battle with the medium" or even quoting
you brian "some art flies based on the level of suspicion it raises -- like
Cage's"

that last being, for me, another fascinating statement ---- i can't imagine
feeling quite that way myself as my own experience of cage's work has not
taken flight on account of any suspicion at all, tho i know what you mean
and certainly can see how the controversy of something like 4'33" is, at a
cultural level perhaps, the prime locus of its meaning or value ---- wd it
help to "note" that i don't operate at a cultural level ?  that while i
certainly can be suspicious (increasingly perhaps on this list) that i have
an aversion to a perpetually ironic stance, to a heuristic of suspicion, to
the proliferation of multiplication of "scare quotes" ?  (i'm not offering
these as criticisms of anyone but as, as i said, ~aversions~ of my own)

there are some very interesting things in yr posting tho that i wd be
interested to see elaborated by you or considered by other tho ----
[quotation follows, apologies in advance removing it from a larger context]

"Part of the reason I think some language poetry fails in terms of this
"reader created meaning" is that the terms of engagement are so much a
development of the poet's advanced views of literature (often based on a
counter-agonic constructivism, or a "pure" anti-subjectivity, or maybe
Cageian indeterminacy, all of which is so "right" to the poet that they
can't fathom the reader not seeing these things) and there is little
attention given to what might be called (with a nod to Rebecca Wolff) the
"general" understanding of poetry (which can involve the "resistances of its
medium") that the reader is often in the position of feeling quite put out
by these terms, or even worse, completely unengaged (hence with no sense of
anticipation of what a true "engagement" would feel like)."

i think i agree with you thru much of this and have agreed with such
assertions, in part at least, whenever i've seen them elsewhere ---- that
is, i find that i am not engaged by many pieces of writing that seem to me
to require that i construct the "meaning" ----- [note: i'm talking about
myself, i dont wish to generalize to a general reader or general
understanding any more that i wd want to posit that anyone's ideas of
literature are "advanced" --- i find both ideas very troubling and not, for
me, very useful {note my "truth-content" use of "note"}  ] ---- i think that
my own lack of engagement with texts of this sort can result from any number
of reasons which might include; a sense of diminished returns; the feeling
that i've already learnt this application of "meaning creation" and don't
feel the need to rehearse it; that it doesnt (organically?) ~get me~; that
i'm tired; etc etc ---- it seems not unreasonable to assume that others feel
some of these same things and certainly many others things about their own
lack of engagement with text X Y or Z

in my own writing i see the "reader's creation of meaning" or whatever as
something of an ever present potential but not anything that i think about
or, honestly, care very much about attempting to foster or require, you
can't shake the fact that people will make something out of the text, so at
present i don't find the consideration of this fact very generative ----
which depending on yr attitudes toward the construct will place "my poetic"
(scare quotes necessary) in varying places on your (generic, plural you
possessive) poetics "map"

i wd be very interested to hear what anyone else thinks about this or about
the notion of resistances being central, tangential or a first (possible)
note that some X is a work of art ---- let me clarify, i wd be interested in

"With cummings, the master of lowercase poetry, there was a friendship.
How they met is legendary. In 1938 and for three years after, Villa wrote
cummings to let him know how much his work meant to him. Cummings never
replied to his letters until 1941, when Jose wrote to say he would never
again write unless the older poet responded. That resulted in an
invitation to visit the poet at his Patchin Place digs. As Villa puts it
in his essay 'Personalia II': 'And so it came to pass that on a Saturday
afternoon in the year 1941 I met that wonderous poet e.e. cummings.' This
meeting presaged a friendship and mutual respect that was to last until
cummings's death in 1962. Once the older poet had read Villa's works, 'he
addressed me as Master,' Villa would declare. The Beat poet Allen
Ginsberg, whom Jose knew from his Columbia days, once asked Jose to
introduce him to cummings. Jose suggested Ginsberg just go over to
cummings's apartment and introduce himself. Ginsberg replied that he had.
'Well?' Jose queried. 'He slammed the door shut in my face,' was the
Beat's sheepish reply."

Is Witz still humming along??

While it doesn't quite equal "primarily", there are more articles on
theoretical stuff in Talisman than in most mags devoted to poetry, indeed
i think something like "a journal of poetry and poetics" is its
subtitle... i would not want to argue that the level there is uniformly
high;  but in fact it is almost uniformly interesting...

Then there is (was?) the Impercipient Lecture Series... As with Witz, is
it alive or no?  Maybe i have stopped receiving these 2 items, or maybe
they are somewhat less frequent of late...or is it something more dire?

Also PhillyTalks

I am really fascinated by this utopia idea and have a lot of incoherent
thoughts on it I don't even completely think yet, but one of course is that
language, or poetry specifically, can be considered a paradise or utopia.  Not
quite a transcendental view.

Another consideration is one of "virtual" structures and modern utopias -- of
logic or image or idea history or etymology or etc.  Are there plural
paradise?  I have in a poem somewhere.

My dystopia poem is of course about the freeway, Greek mythical figures and
whatnot.  But part of an unfollowed longer essay about Los Angeles something
planned communities something landscape influencing writing something:  the
history of LA being what it is...  I went back through the poetics archive,
picking up a book rec:  Soja:  _Thirdspace journeys to Los Angeles and other
real-and-imagined places_.

The other big two are Los Angeles the four ecologies and City of Quartz.

There is some connection to the idea of a pastoral, in my thinking.

Also, of fundamentalist religions enforcing certain rules and behaviors to
control the world for believers, ex. diet restrictions. The Amish are a
specifically interesting case, and the way they treat their teenagers /
rebellion.

Um, so keep this thread going!

Interesting notion, generation.  Like race, it's a highly artibrary concept
which serves to make people feel exclusive and  excluded, usually the same
person feeling both in different contexts.

Maybe Ed Dorn's Abhorrences (covering the 80s). I wonder if you can read
Bev Dahlen's A REading as a documentary (that's probably a stretch). Tom
Clark's Empire of Skin (the otter pelt trade in the pacific northwest).
Simon Ortiz, From Sand Creek. There have to be more, but that's about all
that I can come up with before my supper burns.

This occurred near Ise, precisely during the rebuilding of the shrine.
Nikuko and Izanagi were walking as usual. They approached an old man with
a huge and comical hat, wide-brimmed, of a peculiar shape. Now what, said
Izanagi, smiling. Nikuko noted that the brim was very wide indeed, and the
flap on the left held the Minister of the Right, while the flap on the
right seemed to contain the Minister of the Left. Poor and deluded, said
Izanagi. The old man looked up, and tilted his head slightly to the left.
Whole trees fell down on the slopes and the ground rumbled beneath them.
Then he looked at Izanagi, and tilted his head to the right. The mountain
roared and great boulders crashed on the path all around them. Without
saying a word, the old man slowly continued on his way. This time, it was
Nikuko who was laughing, staring at the hat disappearing in the distance.
He's on the brim, she laughed, he's on the brim.

I would have to suggest Dorothy Livesay's _Let my People Go_, which when it
was first presented on radio and in print was termed documentary--in the
true sense, that entails propaganda for a good cause.

That Bromige. You have to put up with so much. I said, for example,

>>I wish that everyone on the list could be as intelligent as David Bromige.

And he comes back:

I mean, I didnt say anything when four of my favourite shirts went missing
after Bromige came to visit last month. I didnt say anything when I caught
him with a length of hose in the gas-tank of my car last summer.

Somewhere back in the 80's, Hilton Obenzinger (poet and Melville/Twain
scholar and List member) was hired to write a history of fires in New York
City. The client was the New York Fire Department's Union. The publishing
company (a vanity affair that specialized in doing books for municipal unions
- particularly cops and firefolks) went belly up after being sued for fraud
by - I believe it was - the Phoenix Police Department. An irony not lost on
Hilton, who was never paid, but turned his extensive research into New York
On Fire, a book of poems that constitute a unique document and measure of
City pyro-politics. Gothic, dramatic, witty, informed and smart. Still in
print and available (I believe) through Small Press Distribution.
Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Hi--just wanted to note that Keith Tuma's interview with the poet Peter
Riley may be now found on _Jacket_'s website, issue #11:

http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket11/riley-iv-by-tuma.html

It's a substantial piece which deals with both general issues of poetics &
with books such as _Distant Points_, _Snow Has Settled_ and _Lines on the
Liver_.  The interview will be appearing in _The Gig_ 4/5, a book-length
collection of essays on Peter Riley's poetry that's due out in March.  Those
interested in obtaining this collection should write me at
ndorward@sprint.ca for more information.

all best--

Cid wrote in a recent letter:  "...my situation needs some response before

on this list, would be most welcome.  Cid also has lots of valuable archival

appreciated.  I noted a great response from Milwaukee re: the Maldoror

Woodland Pattern to consider a  benefit for Cid?  Any and all information

Dear Poetics,

I'm sending you the list below for two reasons--as a late addition to the
(it's not really a) new millennium reading-shelf thread and to seek yr help
in shortening/reorganizing it since I am bored w my own efforts (I've
already asked the Great Pretentious One, but he'll probably end up making
another poetry machine/koch'u out of it, albeit a shapely one).  What is it
section C of? The Afterword to a forthcoming posthumous collection of
=46rances Chung's poems.  Chung, who lived from 1950 to 1990 and made her
living teaching math in Spanish in Lower East Side public schools, was a
brilliant, wondrous New York Chinatown poet who left behind two unpublished
book mss., CRAZY MELON (ca. 1977) and CHINESE APPLE (post-1980).  These,
and a few pieces selected from her papers stored in her sister's house in
Oakland--Bay Area "art bureaucrats" (Brian's term) please help set up
readings!--form the basis of the book.  If any of you have my anthology
PREMONITIONS, there's a selection in there--also, see Osman & Spahr's CHAIN
5 "different languages." (If you DON'T have a copy of PREM, maybe it's bc
Kaya kept it out of print for 2 years while publishing fetid novels.
They've just suckered the St. Mark's Poetry Project into a 5th-anniversary
celebration of it (Who celebrates the anniversary of an o.p. book?) and
forgot to inform the people who played the biggest roles in making it, like
the Editor and his most-consulted and -trusted poetry friend at the time.
Jeez, maybe Holman will now forward this to Kaya and they'll set their K-9
attorney on me again Woof! Woof!, along w the Stealth-tongued Larry Chua--I
SO Scared!!--Bob: Also ask them if they can please pay me my first cent of
royalties and stop trying to steal the copyright--I still love you, thanks
for the memories!)  In any case,

THE LIST BELOW WAS ORIGINALLY ONLY HALF AS LONG BUT IT WAS ALMOST ALL
CHINESE AND JAPANESE POETRY IN TRANSLATION AND SO I ASKED HER SISTER TO
=46IND MORE BOOKS LEST WE MISCAST FRANCES' WORK AS RE-REFINED POUND AND
REXROTH. BUT SUDDENLY THE LIST'S TOO LONG MAYBE TEDIOUS AND DOESN'T HAVE
THE SHAPELINESS IT HAD BEFORE. NOT A BIG TASK BUT I THOUGHT IT WD BE FUN
SEEING WHAT SOME OF YOU DO W IT cut down redundancy, resequence it acc. to
some algorithm of yrs, etc.--back-channel if you wish IF I USE EVEN JUST
SOME OF YR REORGANIZATION OF IT I'LL SEND YOU A FREE COPY OF THE
BOOK--PROMISE--AND /IF YOU WANT/ MENTION YOU IN THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OR A
=46OOTNOTE OR "WHATEVER" AS MY GLORIOUS GIRLFRIEND SAYS WHENEVER I MAKE LIFE
L00K LIKE A MENU or at least an all-day lunch special. Thanks, Walter

In an unpublished piece, Chung also mentions the following "voices we might

Songs=8Aand the poets of Asian America George T. Chew Tomie Arai Fay Chiang
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge Arthur Sze Jessica Hagedorn Alan Chong Lau Lawson
Inada poems rooted in Chinese poetry=8AJorge Luis Borges.

Much of this literature came to Chung through dedicated poetry publishers
like New Directions and the Greenfield Review Press or poet-led arts venues
below 14th Street that regularly held readings and workshops, such as
Chinatown's Basement Workshop and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.  Chung emerged
as a writer during a time of new cultural and political syntheses in which
community-based groups looked to poetry in particular as archive, song,
protest, and spiritual cultivation.  Beginning in 1971 with the Asian
Women's Journal edited by UC Berkeley students and up through the 1990 "New
Asia" issue of The Portable Lower East Side, Chung's poetry exclusively
appeared in multicultural or women-of-color publications.  She was not
thereby held to some rigid standard concerning the expression of ethnicity,
gender, or locale.  In fact, it would appear that in, for instance,
publishing Chung's poem about the plight of a wifeless restaurant worker in
the _Asian Women's Journal_ or her pantoum set in a Chinese village in _The
Portable Lower East Side_, editors welcomed work from multiple
perspectives. [...]

Just a brief note to draw your attention to the 180 page, perfect-bound Will
Work For Peace, edited by Brett Axel.  With a table of contents that reads
like a who's who of experimental, mainstream, academic, up-and-coming,
old-and-continuing, performance-driven and page-bound poets working in the
U.S. and in some cases (including this one) elsewhere, this book should not
be passed over.  It even has a blurb from Pete Seeger!  All yours from
Zeropanik Press (P.O. Box 1565, Trenton, N.J. 08607-1565--ISBN
0-9666459-1-X) for $13.50.

Or contact Brett Axel directly at  axels@orn.net .  He is looking for work
for a second Peace volume.  He's also seeking poems by bisexual writers for
yet another anthology project.

Just some of the writers in the book (in no particular order):  Sherman
Alexie, Diane di Prima, Elaine Equi, Cid Corman, Maxine Chernoff, Ruth
Daigon, Donald Hall, Charles Fishman, Bob Holman, Marge Piercy, Rochelle
Ratner, Dave Ray, W.B. Snodgrass, Alice B. Talkless (Love the name!), Joel
Lewis, Martin Espada, Antler, Jennifer Ley and about 1 zillion other people
I apologize to for not including their names, but I've got to hit the sack.

The reason my own posts are sometimes too long is that, as it takes often 2-3
days for a post to appear, and just as long to receive a response, I feel I
have to be , on complicated topics, somewhat more rigorous.  My posts, I
noticed, were much shorter before the list was moderated, and are much
shorter on the other listserve in which I participate, where there is almost
no lag time between a posts being written and distributed.  So the format,
which is, after all, intended to discourage substantive discussion, actually
exacerbates the weird form that discussion takes.  But I do have a certain
aesthetic interest in seeing the medium--any medium-- misused--a *poetic*
interest--so perhaps there is a virtue in my boring people after all.

Dear Listmembers,
  I am posting a second Call for Proposals for the "New
Modernisms II" conference to be held at the University
of Pennsylvania, Oct., 2000.
Hope to see you there,
Cassandra Laity
MSA VP

CALL FOR PANEL AND SEMINAR PROPOSALS

Deadline for seminar Proposals: Feb. 15
Deadline for panel proposals: March 30

“A return to modernism at the end of the millennium is
not a farewell but a new beginning.”
Susan Stanford Friedman

In its 1999 inaugural conference, described by The
Chronicle of Higher Education as “giving new life for
modernism,” the Modernist Studies Association created a
forum wherein scholars, poets, musicians and artists
could contribute to this ongoing revitalization.
Modernist studies is reemerging as a dynamic and
complex field, hospitable to interdisciplinary,
international and multicultural approaches and energized
by recent work in race, class, gender and sexuality.

“New Modernisms II” convenes at the University of
Pennsylvania, and will incorporate the urban diversity
of Philadelphia. Our plenary sessions will
emphasize the arts, and performance, but our call for
panel and seminar proposals remains open.

Proposal guidelines are available on the MSA website:
http://www.psu.edu/dept/english/MSA/msa2.htm

The MSA homepage can be visited at:
http://www.psu.edu/dept/english/MSA/msa.htm

Queries about seminar and panel proposals may be
directed to:
Cassandra Laity: claity@drew.edu  or Michael Coyle:
mcoyle@colgate.edu
Completed proposals should be submitted to:
Professor Bob Perelman
Department of English

Subject:      Titles

I'd like to present some reamrks on the procedure of giving a poem a title,
and would very much appreciate listmember comments, either from a personal
perpective...or from an at-large theoretical approach.

This is, I hope, not just an excercise in mole-like pedantry. It is intended
not only to seek an enhanced understanding of how an individual poem...or
poems...are titled, but a query into the shape and variety of these
procedures.

I begin at the begining, I see the procedure of giving a poem a title (in my
own practice the title is given after the poem is made), as an intention to
place a central image before the reader, an image of central importance of
some kind. Following this thread, the title could be seen as acting as a kind
of lantern of Diogenes, prompting a reader's consciousness, and separating
out the misdirection from the truth.

Moreover, this procedure invites examination of the actual occurrences in
which a title is deployed by a poet to see what, if any, systematic uses it
has, and what, if any, organization of interaction it may be realted to.

One aspect of making a poem...giving it a title...can be that onne announces
the type of poem the poet means by initiating, and "I'd like to have your
attention on this poem" can be understood as doing that kind of job.
Obviously, (or maybe not), the titles of poems will be the ones relevant for
those settings. However, not all occurrences of this kind of procedure happen
this way, and many of those that are do not occur in producing a title and do
not do the work of announcing the type of poem being presented.


Over...

jonathan,

i enjoyed yr barbara guest narrative and am always interested to hear how
different people have "come to" different poets -- i'd even propose this
as the kind of thread that might encourage rather than discourage more
participation from list members.

my first exposure to guest was defensive rapture, as someone who, like you
say, read other sun&moon books.  i was at once enamoured of it and began
poking around in the earlier stuff but am by and large a less sensitive
reader to the nuances of the ny school.  then, on either side of defense
rapture, i found fair realism to not show the same kind of subtlties of
sound and syntax as defensive rapture, whereas quill solitary apparition i
thought went too far the other way, rarifying or abstracting itself
i.e. in a manner close to the oft-maligned abstract french lyric.

these of course being rough generalizations that i'd need time and renewed
attention to the texts to substantiate.  i'd also be interested in hearing
some "ways into" guest's earlier work.

bests,
tom

mark p,

far from assuming the mantle of "the nonmainstream harold bloom," jacques
as i read him is strictly towing the line of bourdieu, to a fault even.
(tho i can see where his statement that "they [language poets] stand in
the way of the next generation" might suggest such a connection.)  true,
both models view cultural production (or simply "poetry" for bloom) in
terms of power struggle.  where bloom's model becomes severely
impoverished is, as you suggest, in looking solely to the abstraction of a
freudian oedipal complex as the engine that drives that struggle: the
ephebe is obsessed with the slaying of his poetic fathers, end of story,
more or less.  and it's not simply that such a model can't be proven or
refuted, or that it's simply "a personal mindset," but that it's reductive
and not sufficiently nuanced to, for example, material concerns.

here's where bourdieu is more useful (tho i think his model stands to gain
from a more sophisticated relationship to psychoanalysis), namely by
taking into account the roles that actual and symbolic capital play in
power struggles. part of the emancipatory gesture of not simply langpo
but nonmainstream post wwII american poetry that has generally thrived on
the little magazine and the small press is precisely to exercise control
over its own means of production.  since these things of course do not
happen in a vacuum, and however oppositionally they may position
themselves vis-a-vis the larger field of poetic production (i.e. the
mainstream), the nonmainstream can not help but get caught up in the
dynamics of the larger field.  or, at the very least, its own dynamics as
a sub-field can not help but be in some respects homologous to those of
the larger field to which it inheres.  homologous, i would say, less in
terms of actual capital (i.e. the annual budgets of sun&moon, roof, the
figures, etc., are likely very unlike those of random house, etc.) than
symbolic capital (awards, back catalogs, blurbs, reviews, etc.).

thus jacques' point, i take it, is, simply, that those publishing avenues
founded and fostered by language poets, insofar as they have come to
operate in part in terms of prestige, distinction, etc., i.e. they
accumulate and distribute symbolic capital, are forces with which a poet
working in an experimental or or nonmainstream vein must reckon.

so when you claim that "to actual poets, actually engaging in their work,
and to readers of poetry who respond to it, this is not what's going
on," i might agree that cultural producers are not always consciously
aware of what i'm describing, i.e. "i'm going to write a series of poems
that are going to dethrone geoff young and doug messerli from their
thrones of power."  but you are also suggesting, i think, that they are
operating 1) naively and with no sense of such operations, or else 2) with
no desire at all to see their work appear with publishers such as those
listed above.

bests,
t.
