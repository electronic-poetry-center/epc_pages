My message wasn't intended to headline you Ray. Nevertheless your use of
the personal pronoun indicates where the spotlight has been. Megalomania
is best saved for fading poetry stars who still believe the advertising
about themselves: "It's me! me! me! I deserve it! And I did it! And this
is my crowd! etc.etc." There must be a lot of baby-boomers?

My message addressed our discredit that most people feel inferior at the
prospect of being equal and feel compelled to point out their own
achievements superior compared to others or vent on how 'us' could do a
better job than 'them' if 'us' had the same resources. A house
divided...

How has the PF done you wrong? Did they not agree to support poets,
poetry, and poetics and are doing so? Add what they are doing to your
own efforts, and be happy.


..|  [The PF] have chosen to give themselves
..|  a bigger profile

So this should save you the trouble of promoting them. Now you don't
have to finance Billy Collins next book! Or lobby on behalf of Kay Ryan
so she can win the next award.

But griping against those who are already aligned with us (they are
poets) in the lust to pad our personal stats, to become the next "author
of over ## books and chapbooks of poetry" or be remembered as so, to be
the sole visionary who can 'control' the poetic masses, etc. that's what
creates the divide.

You say: "The problem with the Poetry Foundation is that they are
controlled by small minded people who are not visionaries" and all I say
is that whatever you are willing to do to support and nurture the poetic
community; the same will be returned to you. But whatever you do for
yourself or for your own personal community for the sake of yourself;
the same will be lost because what have you gained?

What reward do you seek to support only those who show support for you?
What kind of person is this? Rather we should send all of today's spare
incomes to the PF right away and be satisfied. If they are only able to
host poetry readings at the cost of $12/head then how much more they
require our financial assistance! We should flood the PF with as many
dimes and nickels as our couches and sofas will furnish to us, and then
pad the envelopes with hundred dollar bills!

Better yet recognize that the poetry does not come out of the
perfect-bound editions or stapled chapbooks or whatever or wherever
money can gain access. These are dead pages, and performances --
appropriately numbered and ordered. Rather the poetry comes from the
living human beings. We should back them up and not the various
'industries', or titles, or 'personal achievements' which fester and
boil all over them.

Revelation does not come off the store shelf. Send Mark Nowak money for
instance, if you wish, but send it *to him*, not to him *for yourself*
for his books.

Likewise, when you publish a new book, poem, or blog entry, don't rush
off to tell your friends or 'peers of significance' so that you might
receive some distinction from them if they were to recommend or remember
you. Rather call out to the disenfranchised and the idle and the lost
and those that haven't found their way to your good company so that they
too can enjoy the benefit of your welcoming community and your community
benefits from their inclusion. No circular back-patting and reciprocal
name-dropping! There is joy in new company, just the same as there is
joy in 'making it new'.

It's not about your achievements rude boy

"rude boy"

Was that necessary? I was did not attack you? I  think that this was
uncalled for.

My post was not about ME ME ME it was about the fact that our artform has no
resources and needs them to thrive.
And the Poetry Foundation is not helping the artform which is what
foundations are supposed to do.

An apology for sending an unintelligible e-mail, which
was meant to be sent well-written and via
back-channel. I'm in the Himalayas, exploring and
doing work in Dharamsala, home of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government in exile, and a
station for refugees. I sat with newly made Tibetan
friends, a Slovenian, and some Czechs, only hours
after an overnight bus trip from New Delhi, and we
drank to the point of endless hugs and what felt like
fresh communion.

I hope, if anyone read what I mistakenly sent, that it
was no problem what-so-ever.

I would agree with Brian here. Otherwise, we may as well go back to =
Edison, and include telegraph messages. There are relationships, of =
course, Morse Code to digital code, and you can trace a legitimate =
history, but "electronic" only means that something is animated with =
electricity. And although Roy Ascott's "telematics" is useful for its =
broad approach to the field of electronic communications, I think that =
the home computer is significant enough be a demarcation, and that =
"digital" defines this nicely.=20

Since the conversation has gone back to Edison, I thought I'd take the
opportunity to plug (in?) my new blog-e-writing installation called
"the body of the assassin," the latest of which features some Edison
stills and clips from the Pan-Am Expo of 1901, where Edison invented
reality TV.

Later I'll post some clips from Edison's staged reconstruction of the
Czolgosz execution -- via electrocution, of course -- and if that ain't
"electronic writing" than i don't know what is!

I definetly agree with the poet who brought up Muriel Rukeyser. Rukeyser was
a great thinker, and a great political and lyrical poet. I have only heard
ONE person in all my years mention her name - I think is was Claudia
Rankine. I have NEVER heard anyone mention the great, seminal poet Bill
Everson/Brother Antonious who was so popular in the 70's in the Bay Area. My
father wrote a biography on him. Also, Larry Eigner and Lorrine Niedecker.
All these poets have published WIDELY and are largely ignored.

I think a real problem in the poetry community is the division between East
and West Coast. Here (I'm in NYC) we hear a lot about Berrigan, Ashbury,
Graham, Bernstein, and so on. All of these are GREAT GREAT poets - but why
don't we ever hear about those mentioned above and MICHAEL PALMER, who is
probably one of the greatest living poets!

Yes, Muriel Rukeyser--whose The Life of Poetry was reissued by Paris Press
in western Mass. a few years ago. "She was a cathedral," said Adrienne Rich
of her.

CFP: Dismodernist Poetics / Post-Ableist Poetics (March 17; Modernist Studies Association
annual convention 06, October 19-22)

The purpose of this panel is to bring two interdisciplinary fields (Disability Studies
and Modern & Contemporary Poetics) into conversation, putting pressure on emerging
terminology in these fields, with a view toward imagining a "post-ableist poetics."

Lennard Davis' founding study, Enforcing Normalcy, posits the source and salient
character of ableist ideology as specifically Modern, while his recent work on "Dismodernism"
envisions "a new category based on the partial, incomplete subject whose realization
is not autonomy and independence, but dependency and interdependence."  Deliberate
or not, this phrasing reads practically identical to axioms in innovative poetics
(re: readership as well as composition), specifically those poetics associated with
Modernist, avant-garde, and contemporary poetries of "indeterminacy."

Classical and neo-romantic conceptions of aesthetics' relationship to eugenics has
been a salient point of scrutiny in Disability Studies thus far.  It remains to
bring Davis' cue into a new conversation about the ways in which Disability Studies
and poetics can serve one another.  Thus, I'm seeking papers addressing forms, processes,
and systems--ways of making--which engage or engender new subjectivities which may
be specifically post-ableist.

* This panel is proposed, not yet accepted.  Send an abstract and short bio (or
CV) by March 17 to patrickdurgin at earthlink dot net.  I will be in touch soon
thereafter.  I am also seeking a chair / respondent for the panel.

but isn't that okay (that some poets aren't mentioned/read)? one of the
things i walked away with from the free verse article is that, despite thos=
e
fellas in charge, there is an audience for all of these things, so all of
these poets are read, just not by the same people. it'd be pretty boring if
everyone knew everyone and we just had to wait for more people to be born i=
n
order to have new poets/poetries.

Message
Spanic Attack is proud to invite you all to submit works and proposals for the series of events Constructivismo 2006, an art exhibit/concert that will take place on March the 4th 2006 at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center in the Lower East Side. Attached you will find the official call to artists. You can also visit www.spanicattack.com/constructivismo1.htm to better appreciate the aesthetic line of the proposal and to listen to the official soundtrack of the event La ciudad en movimiento by Aviador Dro. Constructivismo 2006 will be open for a whole month.

On March the 3rd -the day before the opening of the exhibit- we will hold an academic discussion at NYU, the discussion is called
Going Down for Real: Imagining the Estate of our Town.

Constructivismo 2006 is part of the Resist/Construct Month, which starts off with the Resistance Music Festival (http://www.resistancemusicfestival.com/) on Saturday February the 25th, 2006.

Feel free to forward this email -and the call to artist- to any person that might be interested in contributing to the event. The point of it all is to construct something together, to participate, to share the joy and the frustration of doing art against the odds.

Please note that Spanic Attack's email has changed.

Thanks,
Libertad Guerra

Constructivismo 2006
            Constructivismo 2006, is a call to performance and/or object driven artists, researchers and scientists to employ whatever their mediums towards an insight or proposal of what it means to Edify for inclusion in a month long exhibit at the CSV, New York's incubator for the arts. This affair constitutes a device to encourage a collective exercise in cogent creation; and a mixer of genres, emergent and established artists. The project itself will become IT'S OWN IGNITION MECHANISM for those who dare engage in a sample update of the constructive spirit today. To develop an experiential taste for structures that pulsate just as much as they are mathematical is the gift we all get as result.

            The evening will close with a concert by Aviador Dro, founding fathers of electro-punk in Spain. It is their first visit to North America and they will come to New York City, an important Latin American capital. The critics say: "Aviador Dro deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Kraftwerk, Devo, and Public Image Limited... and if they sang in English rather than Spanish, they certainly would be". They represent the kind of liberating constructivism that shook a country awakening from a brutal dictatorship and closure to the world, as was the case with Spain after the death of Franco.

Enthused by Aviador Dro's vision of the possibility of building a hopeful future even from the most toxics of elements, we invite you to help assemble a constructive laboratory that brings to the forefront our undivided relationship between the City and Art.

Possible themes and dialectics to explore in the interpenetration of Art, Mathematics, and Music:



Plasticism, plastic, Plexiglas

The synthetic as internal harmony

Post or pre-organic ideals.

Mechanical Flight, Freedom Automated

Metal structures, spiritual scaffolding

Industry as humanism.

Toxic waste as sustainability.

Noise and silence.

The ephemeral in things built by humans.

Geometry as internationalism

Suprematist animation (or Form as animate life)

Orphism (or the self-sufficiency of color)

Appropriated Propaganda

Radical Architecture



Feel encouraged to prepare or perform custom-made or manipulated applications of your scientific or artistic creations for the event.

MUSICIANS: we encourage you to submit sounds or original songs to be used as part of the evening's soundtrack.

For the bigger picture on what's at stake and to listen to La Ciudad en Movimiento -anthem for the opening night- visit: www.spanicattack.com/constructivismo1.htm

Submission of proposals to be sent to: spanicattack@optonline.net

            Deadline for inclusion in the opening night is Feb 19th, but the exhibit will serve as a constructive space throughout the month; subsequent proposals can be integrated and built-in to the concluding outcome to be disclosed at the closing night glee.

If you want to build, construct!

PLATFORM: Visual Poetry Exhibition represents the phenomenon of visual =
poetry with works by recognized poets and by emerging young poets. =
Because visual poetry is not widely distributed in Russia, we want to =
show their poems in Russia, both in traditional and in digital forms. In =
addition to its importance to the people of Russia, this exhibition will =
be interesting for foreign artists, writers, and students familiar only =
with western incarnation of this art.

This project combines the technology of networking culture with ideas of =
a virtual "moving exhibition", even as the concept of "original" is =
disappearing and being replaced by digital copy.

Next exhibition (September 2006) dedicate to VISUAL POETRY OF ASIA. The =
synthesis of text material with visual art at this region has really =
long history, thus the familiarization with variety of asian visual =
would be useful not only for amateurs but also for professionals visual =
artists. This project assume participation of artists only form Asia =

z                                            If artist use textual =
information in any non English language, the English translation should =
be enclosed.

=20

The works would be exhibited in digital printed format. The size of =
print copy would be A5 (148X210),A4 (210X297 mm),A3(297X420 mm) with =
white margins not less then 20 mm. The exhibition will follows the =
catalog with CD. CD will include digital copy of the works. The works =
that con not be exhibited in gallery space because of technical =
opportunities would be published on CD also. The author can prepare =
special variant of the works especially for catalog.=20

i wanted to mention, before i forget, that sandra braman has done
some interesting and useful work contextualizing the various
(historical) phases of electrification in terms of information and
the like... see for instance

"harmonization of systems:  the third stage of the information
society."  journal of communications 43.3 (summer 1993):  133-140.

this might have some relevance to the way we talk about the
electronic vs. the digital etc.

Yes, I LOVE Michael Palmer! I was under the impression, however, that over the past few years since At Passages and Promises of Glass  he was receiving more of the attention he deserves, if still not as  much. Hopefully I'm right and hopefully the trend will continue. He  certainly deserves it far more than Graham. Rosmarie Waldrop is known  as a publisher and translator, and is highly regarded in "avant"  circles, but her own poetry doesn't, I believe, have nearly as large a  readership or get the amount of critical attention that it deserves. I  hope I'm wrong. (I'm fairly clueless; I don't really try to keep up  with who's who and whatnot, I can barely organize my time these days to  have any to write.) I hope Reproduction of Profiles and Lawn of Excluded Middle come back into print soon! Better--I hope the whole trilogy, incl Reluctant Gravities, is put out in one volume, like Palmer's Codes Appearing.  I thought I heard a rumor to this effect, actually--anybody know? Of
 course,
 they're both being published these days by New Directions, so  things could be much worse, as the many editors of much smaller presses  on this list could, I'm sure, attest to.

Everson/Brother Antonious who was so popular in the 70's in the Bay Area. My
father wrote a biography on him. Also, Larry Eigner and Lorrine Niedecker.
All these poets have published WIDELY and are largely ignored.

I think a real problem in the poetry community is the division between East
and West Coast. Here (I'm in NYC) we hear a lot about Berrigan, Ashbury,
Graham, Bernstein, and so on. All of these are GREAT GREAT poets - but why
don't we ever hear about those mentioned above and MICHAEL PALMER, who is
probably one of the greatest living poets!

I have to say, as somebody who has now lived almost equal periods of time
on both coasts (and was born in the middle) and has spent some considerable
time in conversations about poets & poetry, I'm puzzled by this -- I've
been hearing and reading about all these poets for manymanymany years --
have been to any number of conferences where people delivered papers on
their works etc. -- Which is never to say they couldn't all benefit, and us
along with them, by even wider discussion --

by the way, what was your father's book on Everson/Antoninus?  I'd like to
look it up --

but here's a proposal -- Shouldn't there be a poetic susbmolecular particle
adhering to all great poets who are overlooked, which would account for
said overlooking,,, perhaps named the neglectorino  -- it would have the
half-life of the reputation of a USA Poet Laureate --

Neglectorino factors/particles:  time (the further back in time, the more likely a writer'll wind
up getting neglected), bad social skills, degree in which the writing is at odds with present
time/place (popular in the 50's for all the reasons we now hate the 50's), extremely limited
publication/non-republication, too little or too much quantity of work, lack of critical
markers/fans, critical markers/fans who are also neglectorinos, too close proximity/similarity to
someone who isn't neglected.  Not all neglected writers have all these factors, but the more
factors a writer has, the greater their chance of becoming neglected.

I love Waldrop too - and her husband Keith. Burning Deck was/is a great
press. Can't find the name of my dad's bio on Everson right quick but dad's
name is Lee Bartlett & I think it's published by New Directions. I still
think Palmer rarely gets any press - he was mentioned briefly in the Times
by Joshua Clover (another good poet) but that's it.

I agree with Maria & others; a few years ago, this list might have been small
enough that almost everybody on it would have agreed that, say, Palmer was one
of the (insert small number here) greatest living American poets--now the list
is so diffuse and people have such different positions re mainstream/magins
that statements about neglect/fame can mean almost anything--"neglect's" been
used to describe anybody less well known than Billy Collins--what is the
_normal_ level of cultural awareness that exceeds "neglect"?  where, what part
of the literray field, are we talking about?  my guess is a current survey of
"overexposorinos" might generate more agreement...(though no, I don't want to
play that game right now)

the LAPD will begin arresting anyone who remains on the 14 acre community
farm in South Central L.A. this week.  this community farm has been a
source of education and nourishment in a largely industrialized community
situated between 2 major freeways.  anyone who has ever lived in L.A.
knows just what a war zone this area is.  the destruction of this farm
will only bring further dispare to a community already wrecked by decades
of drugs and murder.  please forward our request to urge those who can
make it to l.a. or become part of a phone tree to slow down the progress
of destroying this area.  Richard Horowitz is a multi-million contractor
who has said he cannot wait to evict the families squatting on this land
and till the farm for his latest project - another big box warehouse! just
what l.a. needs!

thanks for letting me rant for a moment.

Court Rules Against South Central Farm, Immediate Support Needed! by a

SCF to be Evicted
From My Space

As of today Monday, January 30, 2005, the LA Superior Court has ruled in
favor of Ralph Horowitz and against right of the South Central Farmers to
stay on the farm. As of earlier today, the farmers are officially
illegally "squatting" on the property and can be forcefully removed at any
time from now on at the will of Ralph Horowitz employing the LA Sheriffs
to do so. If you ever had any real interest or support in the struggle of
the South Central Farm and for people's autonomy, now is the time to
prepare for civil disobedience in defense of this space. Please email
Fernando Flores at emonandoflo@yahoo.com to obtain the proper legal
documents needed to participate in the impending civil disobedience and to
become a part of the phone tree that will inform the community of
Horowitz/LAPD attack on the farm. Please share this information with those
you know as soon as possible.

I loved the article and the discussion it aroused. I have a respose
on-line at: http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Changing_a_Culture.htm and
would welcome critical backchannel feedback. A raddom paragraph:

Dana Gioia shows his true colors when he seeks to recreate competitive
recitation bees, so that it is not the imagination that is valued, but
the ability to Sit, Git and Spit, or take in facts and information and
regurgitate it, not unlike a mother bird feeds chicks. Even the Poetry
Slam movement, itself an aesthetic regression that allows so-called
poetry to manipulate the guilt of beer-drinking judges to gain higher
scores and cash prizes, is a better method than Gioia’s idea. And the
Slam is increasingly used in high schools and youth programs around the
country, to some success. Maybe it’s like Jazz, where I started with
Jeff Beck’s version of /Goodbye Pork Pie Hat/ as a teenager, but soon
learned to savor the greasiness of the original version by Charles
Mingus. Maybe the watered down version leads to the more potent brew as
the organism evolves. Either way, Diane di Prima was on to something
when she said: “The only war that matters is the war against/ the
imagination./ All other wars are subsumed in it.”

I am in LA, and indeed in South Central. =20

Perhaps you are unaware that it is legal to keep farm animals (goats, =
sheep,
chickens, ducks, and whatnot) on any property within the city.  Frankly,
South Central IS a farm, and those chickens are noisy and have mites.

Perhaps you are also unaware that due to the proximity to the Imperial
valley and its migrant worker slavery that it makes no freaking sense =
to,
say, pay to water WITH WATER STOLEN FROM THE AQUIFER AND THE COLORADO =
RIVER
and to fertilize a truck garden IN THIS DESERT, since you can go to =
Grand
Central Market downtown and get 10 lbs. of them for A BUCK when they are =
in
season.

What we desperately need, since the riots and before that, is a TAX =
BASE,
because California has NO PROPERTY TAX INCOME due to RONALD REAGAN'S =
PROP
13.  We are lobbying to get big box stores and their taxes and jobs, =
which
bring coffee shops, small scale retail, restaurants, and legal street =
life
into our area, hopefully chasing away the rampant drug dealing and
prostitution; LAUSD is threatening to turn one development across the =
street
from our house (it will include a Home Depot and we hope a Target) into =
yet
another school! that will not only riot constantly as all of the middle
schools and high schools in this area do but also not improve the "ET =
Don
ts" shop on the corner, the vermin-infested Chinese take out place, the
grocery store that only stocks root vegetables and cheap cuts of meat =
near
their expiration dates, and the multitudinous emporia vending human =
hair,
fish frying, etc. etc.

Perhaps you are also unaware that because there are, say, farms in =
central
LA rather than denser housing, public transportation subsidized by =
property
tax, etc., that it is impossible for those living in South Central to =
get to
good jobs "in the city."

I agree with many of the comments on how screwed up the activities of
the Poetry Foundation are vis a vis any kind of writing that I care
about. But, for better or worse, foundations are supposed to fulfill
their missions in whatever way their board sees fit.

If the board of the Poetry Foundation is happy with how the programs
that have been developed will serve the organization's mission, that is
indeed what the Foundation is "supposed" to do & no amount of complaining is
likely to change anything.

Pretty much the only oversight organization there is for foundation in
the US is the Internal Revenue Service, which is concerned with the
non-profit tax status of these organizations. While the IRS may have an
interest in whether a particular foundation is fulfilling its mission,
based on Barr's letter outlining new programs that can be found at the
Foundation's Web site), if there were some kind of IRS investigation,
the Poetry foundation would get off easily.

The IRS is not going to get involved in anything like a stylistic turf
war, if for no other reason than the fact that no one organization could
possibly address the whole field of an artform even as small as poetry.
There are thousands of foundations and other non-profit organizations
who operate without trying solve all of the potential problems in their
field of action without losing their tax-free status. Every hospice
doesn't have to have a bed for every individual dying in a particular
community, every performing arts center doesn't have to sponsor concerts
by every performer who requests a gig, etc etc.

I suppose that one could attempt to get a majority of like-minded people
on the board of directors to try to change either the Foundation's
mission or the programs that have been approved to serve that mission,
but, given that current board members would probably have to approve any
incoming board members, how likely is that?

Steve Evans' analysis of who and what has brought the foundation to its
current situation is very good and far more than just sour grapes, but
unless I'm misreading it, he doesn't seem to be proposing a way to
change what the Poetry Foundation is up to.

  Complaining is one thing, but can anyone reading this list really come
up with a plan of action that's likely to have any effect at all on how
the Poetry Foundation proceeds in spending their money?

Hello,

For the first two weeks of February, CARVE Poems invites submissions of poetry
from women only. This is an attempt to stimulate the stifling of a potential
emerging gender gap in my inbox (and my magazine).

Before submitting, if you aren't already familiar with CARVE, I urge you to
visit the website (www.carvepoems.org) and familiarize yourelf with the
magazine (preferably by purchasing a recent issue). When submitting, please put
6-8 pages' worth of poems into a SINGLE .doc or .rtf and attach it in an email
to carvepoems@yahoo.com. Please use your name as the filename. (Example:
harrietwheeler.doc).

Thanks very much.

I agree with Aldon here. The poets named so far don't seem to be overlooked
at all -- except maybe in whatever constitutes a mass national
consciousness, but I think we could all name dozens of other really good
poets who are much more overlooked. I also don't feel, with regard to the
east/coast split brought up, that I sense it in that way. But then I'm on
neither coast, and I have felt included by poets on each coast, and that I
have worked to include poets from both coasts (and from no coast) in
programs I've developed wherever I've been.

There are still copies available of the first two chapbooks from CARVE
Editions: Jess Mynes's birds for example and Christopher Rizzo's ZING.

In birds for example Jess Mynes creates a rural vernacular reminiscent at times
of Clark Coolidge, Philip Whalen, and Joseph Ceravolo. Flora and frustration,
seasonal changes, sea changes - all are present in these poems which, though
comfortable in their abstraction, find rather than lose the reader.

Christopher Rizzo's ZING will stand as a document of a certain kind of
existence long after its author has left it behind. With a sense of line, break
and word reminiscent of a Renaissance-era Coolidge, Rizzo deftly drops these
lyrics of longing and beauty. The title is apt.

Each book is $5, available via carvepoems.org or via post:

CARVE Poems
221 W. Lincoln #2
Ithaca, NY 14850

Checks made payable to Aaron Tieger.

I am in LA, and indeed in South Central.

Perhaps you are unaware that it is legal to keep farm animals (goats, sheep,
chickens, ducks, and whatnot) on any property within the city.  Frankly,
South Central IS a farm, and those chickens are noisy and have mites.

Perhaps you are also unaware that due to the proximity to the Imperial
valley and its migrant worker slavery that it makes no freaking sense to,
say, pay to water WITH WATER STOLEN FROM THE AQUIFER AND THE COLORADO RIVER
and to fertilize a truck garden IN THIS DESERT, since you can go to Grand
Central Market downtown and get 10 lbs. of them for A BUCK when they are in
season.

What we desperately need, since the riots and before that, is a TAX BASE,
because California has NO PROPERTY TAX INCOME due to RONALD REAGAN'S PROP
13.  We are lobbying to get big box stores and their taxes and jobs, which
bring coffee shops, small scale retail, restaurants, and legal street life
into our area, hopefully chasing away the rampant drug dealing and
prostitution; LAUSD is threatening to turn one development across the street
from our house (it will include a Home Depot and we hope a Target) into yet
another school! that will not only riot constantly as all of the middle
schools and high schools in this area do but also not improve the "ET Don
ts" shop on the corner, the vermin-infested Chinese take out place, the
grocery store that only stocks root vegetables and cheap cuts of meat near
their expiration dates, and the multitudinous emporia vending human hair,
fish frying, etc. etc.

Perhaps you are also unaware that because there are, say, farms in central
LA rather than denser housing, public transportation subsidized by property
tax, etc., that it is impossible for those living in South Central to get to
good jobs "in the city."

The idea that Rukeyser. at this point, is neglected, suggests how widely
split various camps of the poetry world are. Pittsburgh just did a beautiful
collected & there have been THREE selected poems of hers that came out in
last ten years + reissues of a number of her prose books PLUS "How Shall We
Teach Each Other Of The Poet", a festschrift. Rukeyser's "stronghold" is in
the older feminist poetry community, typified by Alicia Ostriker and
Adrienne Rich.

And Michael palmer neglected?????

Paul,
Bravo!!!  And well written.  Though, I find I may share more of Gioia's =
prejudices than even I care to admit.=20

From my youth, I recall three things:
1. hating, detesting H.S. English class & English Teachers (funny thing =
is I became one).
2. loving to read (despite the horrors imposed by faculty zombies).
3. detesting the idiocy of forced memorization and recitation of =
verse...which I confess to having been subjected to in grad classes at =
MSU in East Lansing. =20

In retrospect I acknowledge:
A. H.S. English materials remain with me decades after graduation.
B. The love of reading may have been initiated by teachers...certainly =
not by parents.=20
C. I can, even today, 41 years after having been "instructed" to =
memorize passages of Milton's material, recite that material.  Better, I =
can find metrical patterns similar to them in modern music, and I can =
fault trashy text for it's lack of any pattern form or metrical harmony. =
=20

Bottom Line:
Students and youth tend to be super critical and judgmental of any and =
all efforts stemming from those over 30........Gioia, IMHO, is =
attempting to rekindle a system that helped develop a sense of =
appreciation in his personal life.=20

For the record:
I attempted as an English Teacher to avoid doing or redoing those things =
which alienated me...could be I screwed up big time not having =
sophomores memorize Marc Antony's praise of Caesar.  Gioia, if I =
understand his direction, would have us all commit that soliloquy to =
memory. =20

I'm hard pressed, now, to disagree with that position...but there's =
more.  I'm not sure that is relevant to the issue of how should the =
Poetry Foundation spend its wealth?  That's a subject I'm certain we'll =
find no uniformity about on this LIST.=20

Thanks again for your post.
Alex=20

This comes from StockPhotographer.Info, about a bill that could make
many works of art infringements on trademarks.


 Important New Legislation Proposal  	
Written by Edward Greenberg
Wednesday, 25 January 2006
A few weeks ago I referenced a proposed new Trademark law formally
entitled "HR 683 - the Trademark Dilution Revision Act". It passed in
the House of Representatives and is under consideration by the
Judiciary Committee.

Now stay with me, don't get bored. This is important.

The Act contains certain anti-speech aspects which will directly
affect illustrators, photographers and others.

It will serve to eliminate the current protection for non-commercial
speech currently contained in the Lanham Act. It will prevent
businesses (artists)and consumers from invoking famous trademarks to
explain or illustrate their discussion of public issues.

For example, using the phrase "Where's the Beef" could be actionable.
Although you might use it in a non-commercial way, the (very) famous
Wendy's slogan when used to comment might not be protected by the
fair use exception.

The Act would give companies considerable leverage in preventing
artists and photographers from employing their marks in images by
claiming the mark is being "diluted". The bigger the company, the
more famous the trademark, the easier it will be to prevent you guys
from using it. National companies with highly recognizable marks
would have more leverage than any single creator or small business
and would easily outspend any of you to prevent your using their
mark.

Exceptions for fair use, non-commercial use, reportage, commentary,
etc. currently existing could disappear and would be no defense to
claims of infringement of a registered or unregistered mark. Trade
dress is often unregistered.

To see how this new legislation might operate, go to
www.dsart.com/Gallery/VW_bug.htm. That illustration was created by
Donald Stewart in 1992. Mr. Stewart has displayed the work to
students in classes and used it as a teaching tool. The image has
also been sold.

VW of America has threatened Mr. Stewart with litigation in
anticipation of the new law. The Volkswagen Beetle is composed of
bugs.
The illustration does not disparage VW in any way. It is lighthearted
and whimsical. It clearly posts the VW marks.

I dare say most if not all of you, have created works which like Mr.
Stewart's, are not disparaging and employ some recognizable mark
somewhere in your image. A photo using a Hummer for example, to
comment on the proliferation of gas guzzling SUVs could give
GM/Hummer cause to prevent the publication of your image. Incidental,
background use of a recognizable mark like a Coke can for example,
could easily result in your prompt receipt of a lawyer's letter from
a really big law firm representing a really, really big corporation.

As written, strong cases have/could be made against candidates who
have used popular marks to comment on their opponents. This is not a
right wing/left wing thing. It is a free speech, little guy against
big guy thing. Your artistic freedom is at risk.

I urge all of you to write to Senator Arlen Specter, Chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, 711 Hart Building, Washington, DC 20510
to voice your opposition to this bill.

Mr. Stewart is ably represented by Paul Alan Levy, Esq. who is with
Public Citizen Litigation Group, 1600-20th Street, NW Washington DC
20009 www.citizen.org/litigation. He has taken an active role in
fighting this proposed legislation and deserves your vocal and
written support.

This is your livelihood we are talking about here. Don't bitch about
corporate coercion, do something about it. Send a letter or better,
send a photograph accompanied by a short note to make your point. You
guys get paid to create images to sell products and ideas get
people's attention. Get Senator Specter's attention and write to your
own Senator as well.  The bad guys are betting heavy on your well
earned reputation for apathy.

The latest issue of Big Bridge contains PRELUDE, a special feature on my
recent work, focusing on IMPROVISATIONS. It includes colored panels of the
visual poetry found in the later section of the work and reviews by Jonathan
Penton, Ric Carfagna, Dan Waber, Kirpal Gordon and Stephen-Paul Martin.
Michael Rothenberg and Jonathan Penton did an excellent job in presenting
and discussing my work. I'm pleased with the work they've done and honored
by the attention they've given my work. I encourage you to check out the
PRELUDE section at

I agree with Maria & others; a few years ago, this list might have been small
enough that almost everybody on it would have agreed that, say, Palmer was one
of the (insert small number here) greatest living American poets--now the list
is so diffuse and people have such different positions re mainstream/magins
that statements about neglect/fame can mean almost anything--"neglect" has been
used to describe anybody less well known than Billy Collins or Mattie J
Stepanek--
what is the_normal_ level of cultural awareness that exceeds "neglect"?  where,
what part
of the literary field, are we talking about?  my guess is a current survey of
"overexposorinos" might generate more agreement...(though no, I don't want to
play that game right this minute)

LINKS HALL PRESENTS=20
"an incomplete map of everything"=20
An interdisciplinary festival of language, performance, and sound=20
February 3 - February 26, 2006=20

January to March 2006: Links Hall's new Artistic Associates - Jennifer =
Friedrich, Mark Booth and Nicole LeGette - each curate a month-long =
series of performance, based on expertise in their respective artistic =
fields. February's program has been curated by Mark Booth.=20

"an incomplete map of everything is a fragmentary atlas of an imaginary =
world. The festival is comprised of co-existing "landforms" of an =
experimental nature; the Goldsmith archipelago, the B=F6k atoll, the =
plateaus of Goulish, the Bervin Sea, the isthmus of Mallozzi, and the =
fjord of Ross. There are other topographical features as well, both =
familiar and unfamiliar; emerging glaciers, new volcanoes, and uncharted =
estuaries. If there is one thing these artists have in common apart from =
their shared commitment to experimentation and investigative exploration =
it is their interest in probing the minimal elements that form the =
materiality of human experience." - Mark Booth, curator=20

Links Hall is located at 3435 N. Sheffield Avenue, convenient to the =
Addison Red Line El stop. Reservations for all events highly =
recommended, please call 773-281-0824. Pay at the door.=20

WEEKEND 1=20

Christian B=F6k / Terri Kapsalis=20
Friday, February 3 at 7:30pm=20
Admission $10=20
B=F6k is the author of the award-winning books Crystallography and =
Eunoia, and is Professor of English at the University of Calgary. Eunoia =
is a benchmark of experimental literature in the lineage of Georges =
Perec: each chapter features words exclusively employing one vowel (the =
narrative in "Chapter A" is composed of words where "A" is the only =
vowel used, and Chapters E through U follow suit). B=F6k's impish =
playfulness reveals the inner music of words and the mystery of the =
common materials of language. Kapsalis' latest fiction has appeared in =
3rd bed, Parakeet and The Baffler; she is the author of Public Privates: =
Performing Gynecology from Both Ends of the Speculum.=20

Christian B=F6k / Judd Morrissey=20
Saturday, February 4 at 7:30pm=20
Admission $10=20
An evening of readings by B=F6k and hypertext narratives by Morrissey. =
Morrissey's works include an unstable, self-evolving, virtual page that =
continuously re-writes itself in response to the reader; for Links Hall, =
he presents work from his project The Error Engine, which explores =
memory, accident, and the book.=20

Relaxation Record (Jim Dorling) / Jesse Seldess=20
Sunday, February 5 at 7:30pm=20
Admission $10=20
Relaxation Record, a solo project by Jim Dorling of the influential =
acoustic ensemble Town and Country, presents the musical performance Let =
your mind dissolve in the pitch black space within your head. Seldess, =
editor of the journal Antennae, and co-curator of the Discrete Reading =
and Performance Series, presents a pre-recorded video reading, made with =
Leonie Weber.=20

THROUGHOUT THE MONTH:=20

Daniel Borzutzky: (Proxy) Missives from Turkey=20
Each night a member of the audience will be invited to read one of a =
series of twelve short texts specifically written for each evening of an =
incomplete map of everything by Borzutzky from the Yerebatan Cistern in =
Istanbul. Borzutzky's book Arbitrary Tales was published by Triple Press =
in 2005. His translations of Chilean poet Jaime Luis Huenun appear in =
Circumference and are forthcoming in Fascicle; they will be also be used =
as part of the Poetry Society of America's Poetry in Motion program and =
will be hung on buses in Los Angeles. He is a professor in the English =
Department at Wright College in Chicago.=20

Search Engines Challenged on Theft
By Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, Media Editor in London
Published: January 31 2006 19:55 | Last updated:
January 31 2006 19:55

A group of newspaper, magazine and book
publishers is accusing Google and other
aggregators of online news stories of unfairly
exploiting their content. They are demanding
compensation from search engines.

Gavin O'Reilly, the president of the World
Association of Newspapers, which is
co-ordinating the campaign, said on Tuesday: "We
need search engines, and they do help consumers
navigate an increasingly complicated medium, but
they're building [their business] on the back of
kleptomania."

[. . . ]

The WAN, which represents 18,000 newspapers and
73 national newspaper associations, said it
would examine whether new standards and policies
could be drafted to create a commercial
relationship between publishers, search engines
and content aggregators.

Mr O'Reilly singled out Google for criticism,
saying: "As a general rule, Yahoo, MSN and Ask
Jeeves seem more open to constructive dialogue.
Its only Google which seems to have this
absolute view [that all information should be
available for free]." Google could not
immediately be reached for comment.

Mr O'Reilly likened the initiative to the
conflict between the music industry and illegal
file-sharing websites and said it was not a sign
that publishers had failed to create a
competitive online business model of their own.

I think newspapers have developed very
compelling web portals and news channels but the
fact here is that were dealing with basic theft,

It=E2=80=99s about time! Talk about being neglected. This  collaborative exh=
ibit is=20
excellent.

Phenomenology, epistemology,  and the post-modern view of language and =E2=
=80=9Cself=E2=80=9D
 permeate the work of poet Vernon  Frazer. Deconstruction of language itself=
,=20
for the purpose of enabling  communication between the poet and audience,=20
only seems* oxymoronic.  Spontaneous, obviously. Simultaneity, hoped for.=20
Subcutaneous, definitely. Read  his words aloud, because poetry must* be hea=
rd. The=20
way Frazer strings his words  together, his flow, eventually causes me to se=
ek=20
dry land and silence; a respite  from his deluge of glossolalia. His=20
projective verse subverts my attempt to  create meaning. Follow his flow to=20=
the end and=20
=E2=80=9Csee=E2=80=9D the state-of-communication,  more honest than the rece=
nt state-of-the=20
union.  =20

What  Vernon seems to have discovered for himself is that language whether=20
spoken as  spontaneous prosody, or its polar opposite, usually fails as=20
transitive  communication.  I appreciate extremely modern poetics, because w=
ords and =20
form are free and more likely to provoke change in the reader. They can =20
literally be mind-altering. If art doesn=E2=80=99t change us, what will? Tha=
t which =20
enables change and freedom in the individual is wondrous. In the not too dis=
tant =20
past, I thought certain words and forms weren't poetic. IMPROVISATIONS is my=
 new=20
 outlaw book of poetry. It violates many misconceptions of what poetry and =20
language are: a deluge of sound and fury, signifying nothing.=20

One  has only to read aloud his glossolalia to grasp the moebius of=20
communication.  I'm nearly speechless, an effect of reading aloud his many w=
ords, which=20
fade  into a numb silence. He understands the futility of most of what passe=
s=20
for  talking and writing. The body, the tongue our instruments. The point of=
=20
poetry?  The point of speaking? The point of communication? Everything and =20
nothing.

The latest issue of Big Bridge contains PRELUDE, a special feature on  my
recent work, focusing on IMPROVISATIONS. It includes colored panels of  the
visual poetry found in the later section of the work and reviews by  Jonatha=
n
Penton, Ric Carfagna, Dan Waber, Kirpal Gordon and Stephen-Paul  Martin.
Michael Rothenberg and Jonathan Penton did an excellent job in  presenting
and discussing my work. I'm pleased with the work they've done and  honored
by the attention they've given my work. I encourage you to check out  the

breathing heavily, turning sharply, reading
  hungrily, spraying those clip-on clouds
  over any area of sky they'll take, until
  even the sidewalk slate-frail and open-ended
  blends with the firmament. I move upon
  these dark waters in this deep, knowing
  that nothing in me drags their silked eyes
  back home, where I've layed them out,
  sprayed them down, slathered their disarray
  interiors with parts of what she's

Heah, before all this neglectoring descends entirely into the sloughs of
self-pity, despond & bitterness, I do recommend - as I occasionally do -  a
detour to Chris Sullivan's New Orleans' sight/site where he has neatly begun
to arrange a photographic collection of 50 basketballs, all of which are
recently recovered from the woes of Katrina - talk about colorful
defacements, bruises and holes of neglect!
http://www.8letters.blogspot.com/

I think Chris has put together a quite beautiful - not yet finished -
Anthology of the misbegotten and forgot.

It might be a wonder to see what he could with the mugs of forgotten,
overlooked and lost poets. Possibly an anthology  just as good as these
basketballs, I bet.

Dear All,

Please join us this week.
In lieu of the usual corny quip, we will share with you what January 30th
had to say on the desktop poetry calendar that has made its way into our
office:
       =20
    Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It=E2=80=99s that time of nigh=
t,
lying in bed, thinking what you really think,
    making the private world public, that=E2=80=99s what the poet does.
                  =20
-Allen Ginsberg

Love,

The Poetry Project

book Life is forthcoming from O Books. He is currently at work on a lifelon=

project composed of individual books. He practices Zen and cultivates
friendships. Tony Towle has been  associated with the New York School of
Poetry for over 40 years, having taken workshops with Kenneth Koch and Fran=
k
O=E2=80=99Hara at the New School in 1963. In 1970, he received the Frank O=E2=80=99Hara
Award, in conjunction with which his first major collection, North, was
published. He has published 12 books in all, most recently, The History of
the Invitation: New & Selected Poems 1963-2000 (Hanging Loose), Memoir
1960-1963 (Faux Press, 2001), and Nine  Immaterial Nocturnes (Barretta

PRACTICAL CRITICISM: A POETRY WORKSHOP =E2=80=93 TONY TOWLE
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 14TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIt is assumed that participants will be serious, practicing poets and so
critiques and comments will be made from the vantage point of what the
person has already established, not with a view to =E2=80=98prescribing=E2=80=99 some
different way of writing. However, stretching the sensibility will be
encouraged, both in the group and through individual suggestion. Non-bindin=
g
assignments will be given each week and poems from the past as well as thos=
e
of the workshop participants will be read aloud and discussed. In the cours=
e
of this, numerous poets past and present, and topics both literary and
general, will arise and be talked about. Also I will make written comments
on poems individuals may prefer not to have read aloud.=E2=80=9D John Ashbery has
written: =E2=80=9CTony Towle is one of the best-kept secrets of the New York

THE UNPERFORMABLE: THE VISUAL SIDE OF POETRY =E2=80=93 EVELYN REILLY
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 16TH
=20
=E2=80=9CThe traditional notion of poetry as primarily a matter of =E2=80=9Cvoice=E2=80=9D ha=
s often
obscured its graphic and visual character, and can limit the range of
experiment to what can be experienced in the venue of the poetry reading.
Even the most performance-based poets, however, face issues of how to
spatialize their work on the page, and every line break is as much a visual
as a rhythmic and aural decision. This workshop will explore a broad range
of visual poetics =E2=80=94 from modernist innovations to composition-by-field to
recent spatialized text, concrete, collage, and digital poetry. We will
examine work by Mallarme, Apollinaire, cummings, Olson, Schwerner, Hak Kyun=
g
Cha, Aram Saroyan and Susan Howe, and peruse the UbuWeb site together.
Everyone will be encouraged to analyze the visual assumptions behind their
poems as well as to write or revise work using alternative visual
conventions.=E2=80=9D Evelyn Reilly=E2=80=99s book Hiatus was published by Barrow Stree=
t in
2004 and was a finalist for the Poetry Society of America=E2=80=99s Norma Farber

THURSDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 6

=E2=80=9CHow do we get the swirling-inside/outside-the-head onto the page? What a=
re
the differences between knowledge and information, and what are we putting
into our poems? Why? We will look at poets & projects confronting these
questions & we will explore our own potential in navigating transitional
space (community, jobs, war, media). We may look at poems by Etel Adnan,
Ammiel Alcalay, Jules Boykoff, Ernesto Cardinal, Roque Dalton, Kevin Davies=
,
Jeff Derksen, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Dana Gelinas, Fanny Howe, Susan
Howe, Pattie McCarthy, Yedda Morrison, Alice Notley, Mark Nowak, Douglas
Oliver, Kristin Prevallet, Deborah Richards, Cristina Rivera-Garza, Kaia
Sand, Leslie Scalapino, and Rodrigo Toscano. We will discuss how we read an=
d
what we value, how to assess the values of any given poem. We may address
contradictions in literal or figurative yogic practice and the
(in)corporate(zation) rush. How can we sustain simultaneously our health an=
d
our engagements with destruction?=E2=80=9D Carol Mirakove is the author of Mediat=

IS
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 17TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIn  this workshop, we will the explore the poetry and poetics of the New
York School of Poetry. A school of writing more linked by personal alliance=
s
and mutual dislikes, it features a dazzling range of approaches ranging fro=
m
the radical formalism of Edwin Denby to the the permanently =E2=80=9Cunder

re
poets with Pulitzer Prizes (John Ashbery, James Schuyler), poets with rock
bands (Jim Carroll, Patti Smith, Janet Hamill), poets who run for President
(Eileen Myles) poets who are actually read by non-poets (Frank O=E2=80=99 Hara) a=
nd
poets held dear mostly by other New York School Poets (Joe Ceravolo, Steve
Carey and Jim Brodey). We will explore New York School techniques  such as
collaborations, appropriative writing, list poems, cut ups, rewrites, lists=
,
invented forms, reinvented forms, sonnets and the secrets of how-to-keep
-going-when-you-having-nothing-interesting-to-say.=E2=80=9D Joel Lewis is the aut=

POETRY WORKSHOP =E2=80=93 DAVID HENDERSON
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 18TH
=20
=E2=80=9CWe are making manuscripts of our work (at whatever stage the work or the
poet or both are). As poets we are also looking at and sometimes working
with prose, as another form of poetry, as well other forms of poetry such a=
s
lyrics, raps, spoken word form(ats) or even simple lines =E2=80=93 good in and of
themselves. We practice exercises and routines of the poet. We often listen
to the works of each other =E2=80=93 in progress. And there is always the right t=
o
just read a work without comment or criticism.=E2=80=9D Poet, lyricist, and
biographer David Henderson is the author of several books, including Jimi
Hendrix: Voodoo Child of the Aquarian Age and Neo-California.

No Great Society is a riveting neo-beat riff by Elevator Repair Service,
renowned for their reinvention of found objects and fragments of space and
time. In this world premiere, ERS veteran and enigmatic physical performer,
Susie Sokol conjures Jack Kerouac while sonic artist Ben Williams channels =
a
piano-pattering Steve Allen and prostrate William F. Buckley. A pair of
legendary interviews rip loose and spiral into a surreal and chaotic
exchange, soaked with liquor, jazz and philosophy.

There's not a person alive who can read the NEGLECTORINO PROJECT
and say that they've heard of EVERY poet on it.

But maybe you are all talking about the poets you are discussing on
the Buffalo List?  Anyway, here's the NEGLECTORINO PROJECT:
_http://neglectorino.blogspot.com/_ (http://neglectorino.blogspot.com/)

Maybe you're all discussing Palmer, etc., I don't know for  certain.

If you REALLY HAVE heard of all the poets in the NEGLECTORINO  PROJECT
then we need to hear MORE for YOU!  wow!

I read almost nothing but poetry, and I learned A LOT FROM THIS  LIST!
And then there's the work Tom Orange and Shanna Compton did to  make
LONG out of print books available for the first time in half a  century (or
more...

people.

i don't know how anyone looking at the lists conrad has compiled can
make generalizations like "none of these poets are really overlooked" or
"overlooked doesn't really mean anything anymore." 58 poets each
contributed a list of anywhere between two and probably a dozen names
each, so there's naturally going to be a wide range of what people take
"neglected" or "overlooked" to mean.

and there's a world of difference between a street poet you may have
heard once and thought was brilliant but was never and will never be
published, versus someone who published 50 years ago and hasn't been
read by anyone in 49 years versus someone who was well-acknowledged 30
or 20 or 10 years ago but whose work is out of print and therefore
unavailable to new audiences. hugh steinberg's list of factors
contributing to this is spot on, as is kevin thurston's point that how
boring it would be if "new" poetry meant simply waiting for new poets to
publish new books.

and what may have been available or well-attended to 30 or 20 or 10 or 5
years ago may be unavailable and neglected now. for years i could not
find a collected rukeyser anywhere. and yeah, compared to elousie lofton
and others that are coming to light through the kind of wonderful work
al nielsen and lauri ramey have done in their new anthology, rukeyser
and michael palmer are hardly negelcted/ i remember ben friendlander
telling me once how he used to see stacks of clark coolidge's the
maintains and polaroid on the shelves of serendity books in berkeley and
he said if he knew then how rare those books would be now he would
bought some extra copies.

"The only thing that is different from one time to another is what is
seen and what is seen depends on how everybody is doing everything. This
makes the thing we are looking at very different and this makes what
those describe it make of it, it makes a composition, it confuses, it
shows, it is, it looks, it likes it as it is, and this makes what is
seen as it is seen. Nothing changes from generation to generation except
the thing seen and that makes a composition." (Gertrude Stein,
"Composition as Explanation")

Why be so dismissive? How's everybody doing everything out there? Why
not add to the list instead of quibble about who should and should not
be on it? The more neglectorinos the better! Add 'em to the list, make
'em be seen...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Oh my God! I didn't mean to start a scandel because I said Palmer was
neglected!
Palmer was in the second half of my post - not necessarily about neglected
poets, but about East Coast versus West Coast. My point is that the East
Coast literati is dismissive of all others. IE How much do we hear about
Berrigan and Ashbury! (both great poets) but not Palmer, Everson, Cole,
even Duncan. But, this is just my perspective from living in NYC. The great
thing about the listserv is that people are reading from everywhere and can
give a different perspective.

I stand by my convition of Murial Rukeyser as a widely published, then
forgotten poet. MR published in the 1930-1974 when she died. I discovered
her via a gift from my father in 1994 - the MR reader published by Norton. I
wrote my grad thesis on her. In 1994, this was the only book she had in
print, and it was a few years later that people got interested. Life of
Poetry was FINALLY re-issued in 1996, and very difficult to find. 12 years
later, her collected came out. I'm paranoid, and argued that she was pushed
aside (for almost 20 years) because she was a commie.

Is she "neglected" like Ashbury's John Wheelwright? Obviously not. But in a
certain context, yes.

Wow, that's so amazing David!  Did you meet Rosalie Moore!?  I've  been
wanting to speak with someone who met her!

And William Talen?  You're the first then, and my new best  friend!  Which
books of his do you like best?  Maybe you have some I've never heard  of,
and if that's the case it would be great for all of us to know about  them!

I'M SO EASILY AMUSED!  Yes yes yes, of course there are many  names
on that list some of us have heard of, but that wasn't the  point!  So what!
The
project was about creating a space where names NEW names would appear
so that we could investigate.  I guess if you didn't find even ONE  name on
there that was new then the list didn't do it's job for you.  But,  whatever,
so what.

"YEAH WELL I'VE BEEN PRAAISED BY THEM!  PRAAAISED I TELL YOU!
THEY LOOOOOOOVE ME!"  Hehehehehehehe!  I LOVE IT!  I'm  cracking up over here!

To be honest with you, people who bitch and moan amuse me SO MUCH!

Sometimes I think I'm the luckiest person BECAUSE I'm so easily  amused!

When I win the lottery (I intend to win the lottery) I'd really love it if  a
bunch
of you bitches would come over to my new and spacious trailer I'll buy  with
my lottery winnings and bitch and moan on command every time I throw  you

Oh great and powerful David, if you actually HAD read the list (I don't
believe you did)
then you would NOT have been able to miss the BRIGHT RED LETTERS  asking
folks to continue to expand the list.

Did you actually NOT see the five comment boxes scattered throughout the
list?
Were they not bright enough beacons for you to impart your wisdom?
Oh dear I truly HAVE FAILED YOU!  Oh David, can you ever forgive  me?

Well, when/if you do forgive me (don't strain yourself) (anymore than I
would ever
REstrain myself), feel free to add to the list.

be exciting but it's a great concept it's you know it could in other
words that could be I could take the language that I record myself
speaking all week no one else speaking, just the shit that I spew
myself and think now, how could I represent this visually
differently?  That's raw material.  How could that be represented you
know if every word of language was a drop of water and I counted it
out and dropped in into a glass would this represent my language for
a week?" -- Kenneth Goldsmith, Soliloquy

Yes David please I want the list expanded.  When Conrad sent
out the call to contribute I thought, Oh I'd love to
contribute but what do I know about poetry?  But see I wrote
something anyway and it turned out all wrong.  I hope you can
fix it, all our mistakes.

Friends,

  I added Rukeyser's Life of Poetry to my "neglectorino" list to praise  Paris Press for keeping that work in print. That book (and I was  thinking more about books than poets necessarily) was certainly  neglected and thankfully rescued. But it's interesting that folks are  quick to declare MR a candidate for president.

  Thanks to CA Commrade for starting such an interesting conversation!

(Responding initially to Aldon Nielson's post below:) So do we all just  accept life in our little cliques and niches? And accept the relative  marginality of poetry? Maybe for our own mental health...

  And linking this to the Poetry Foundation thread I've admittedly only  been glancing over, are there two distinct kinds of poetry: a  conservative one and an oppositional one? Or does all poetry, as I  remember Graham claiming in her Intro to the BAP 1990, resist  materialist cultural values and the reification of  thinking/subjectivity into commodifiable knowledge/egos??? I can't help  but think that people like Sharom Olds, Mark Doty, Billy Collins, etc.  offer excrutiatingly "digestible" work that speaks from/to/only on the  level of the ego, to put this in psychoanalytic terms, functioning as a  screen against the more "disruptive" drive as much as anything produced  by the much-bashed Hollywood entertainment industry, as much  consolidating therein the ego's defenses/the subject's ceding of  desire. So there's "poetry" and there's poetry and we all know which  the Foundation is funding and of course they have the right to do this  but it is certainly an occassion for m
ourning
 an amazing and very  missed opportunity. But maybe my instinct is wrong and all poetry does  have something beyond the consumerist, conformist, ideology-invested  ego to offer? I'm really just not sure on what basis even to attempt to  make the judgment.... Especially when I think most conscious attempts  to write something "subversive" or "oppositional" end up producing  poetry just as "bad" as Olds, et al. and you can never, I think,  predict the outcome and effects of your discourse/writing practice to  begin with. Radical ideology is just as tied up in the ego as  conservative ideology. So what makes a poem oppositional? Oppositional  to what? Maybe a poem can desire where you, the ego, cannot. It  precipitates subjectivity. And this can happen in confessional and/or  narrative poetry? But not as likely? How do you know when it happens?  You don't, I think, really.

  Feeling very confused,

  Tod

Perhaps the best, certainly the most exhaustive and completely =
researched compilation of the Bush administration's antics.  Better yet, =
the creators use the Bush administration's "Deck of Cards" to label the =
characters...remember the Deck created to identify the ogres in Iraq?  =
Bush, the Ace of Spades...I loved it.

Hi, all.  My mss, New Jersey, has won the U of Wisconsin's Brittingham Prize, and now I have to fill out a lengthy Marketing Survey.  I really need your help with three items.  Can you please back-channel:

1)  Suggestions for bookstores that would be interested in carrying a political/experimental book-length anti-war meditation from the Jersey Turnpike, i.e. poetry bookstores in this country or abroad?

2)  Venues to do reading at

3)  Publications to review the book

4)  Top four pubs in which to advertise

5)  Mail-order catalogues, book clubs, etc. for poetry

Thanks so much.  I know it's lots to ask, but I'm overwhelmed.  Best, Betsy

kind of a relief that poetry isn't a commodity, but that it is written
(mostly) by people

but part of the problem is poetry is still a product in many respects, =
so we
can ask, who is the corvair of poetry, a decent car with a pretty minor =
fan
belt problem done wrong by a Ralph Nader early in his career?  who is =
the
Edsel, which could have been named by Marianne Moore but was not, and =
that
was a good thing?  which group of poets are the tucker cars, the other =
cars
made before the distribution system solidified into the Detroit =
carmakers of
the post ww 2 period?  which poets don't translate well to American =
poetry,
like the Yugo? =20

hugh steinberg's list of factors
contributing to this is spot on, as is kevin thurston's point that how
boring it would be if "new" poetry meant simply waiting for new poets to
publish new books.

and what may have been available or well-attended to 30 or 20 or 10 or 5
years ago may be unavailable and neglected now....
i remember ben friendlander
telling me once how he used to see stacks of clark coolidge's the
maintains and polaroid on the shelves of serendity books in berkeley and
he said if he knew then how rare those books would be now he would
bought some extra copies.

Ah, I helped her through the door of the Ritz-Carleton in Montreal in
something like January 1970,
when we had her in town for our reading series. We usually had people
like Robert Creeley and
Charles Reznikoff, but we decided that once in a while we should have
famous poets from a less
edgy tradition.

reznikoff as 'edgy' seems wild.  i like his work, alot, but edgy?  maybe it
is my 'distance' ie, under 40-ness.

Sorry to have lost this thread, Wystan. I was away in the "real woods", and
just getting my cyber bearings back - if there is such a thing.

The issues you raise our pertinent. I suspect I am saying that Long's purely
text pieces (as different from one's where he either maps or provides signs
for the directions of the way the wind blows over several days) I find, too
"bald" - in the way a graph in a DNA lab book I find too abstract -even if
fascinating - from the substance of process.
The language in early Snyder is more fleshed out - albeit spare - and much
more within the materials of a particular landscape.  Yet, indeed, reading
Snyder,unlike Long he is also never reluctant to rise above the bare
materials and invoke myth and history (the IWW, John Muir) can go in the
other direction - the invocation of myth and larger narrative.
Long clearly wants to strip down things as totally as possible (tho he is on
the Pacific Crest Trail in the Sierras, he makes no textual gestures towards
Muir. In the lecture he did talk about some of his brief encounters with
people on the trail - the guy going the length "barefoot" - but none of
those encounters enter the work as part of any text. At most he is creating
his own legend!
Yes, in the way Long's language is shaped to correspond to the map shape of
his walk or climb (say, for example, an arc), it borders between poetry and
visual art. At the same time, in that it is language I think it right to
criticize it in the manner of a poem (good, uninteresting, etc.) I don't
think he can get away by just legitimizing the text work as "the words equal
objects= sufficient justification." Sometimes they are clunkers.

By the way, I still think much of Long's work is visually brilliant. A first
rate mind, immaculately precise (with a great sense of beauty and awe). And
it's that interface between his enactment and precision of abstract forms
(circles, lines, etc.) with nature's impermanence that creates such a
compelling tension.
 Other than the perhaps imaginative conception and legend that he creates
about a particular walk, it's not about literature - as Wordsworth or Thomas
A. Clark (tho we can see him as a representative in the long history of the
literature of walking); I read his work as much more about math and nature
and, maybe not so oddly, sublimity, particularly the process and sublimity
of looking closely -temporarily engaging the materials - and building his
sculptures so!

Congratulations!  I bought your chapbook a few years ago and have been a big fan since.
You've probably already thought of these reading venues but:

Bowery Poetry Club

Happy Ending

the Ear Inn

Atomic Cafe

Galapagos Bar also has some nice reading series.  You might try the Poetry Project.

Good Luck!

ROUGHLY SAID:

\

Someone who is still alive and terribly neglected is Ira Cohen. Ira has been
everywhere and done it all, a true multi-media poet. A forefather of many of
the poets who see themselves as "renaissance" poets because of their
involvement in varied art forms, Ira is accomplished photographer, editor,
filmmaker, and author of hundred and hundreds of beautiful poems. Ira has
never had a book published by a large or even medium sized publisher.
Everything Ira has done in the way of publication is through little mags and
small, small press underground publications. He has been treated a lot like
Micheline and Kaufman have, as some kind of embarassment to established
"kultur", and has rarely been celebrated at national poetry venues. In no
way is Ira Cohen especially beat, he is way more a part of an international
avant garde. He comes from Lautremont, Baudelaire, and the like,
identifiable with Burroughs, Bowles, and Gysin. He has a few hard core
followers, in the US and in Europe, who are familiar with his work. His film
on Kumbha Mehla is a mind blower, plants him in a psychedelic, maximal vein
which is totally unrepresented by any surveys of poetry from the 50's
forward. His recordings of his own readings with DJ Cheb i Sabbah are some
of the best readings of poetry and music ever recorded. As a child of the
60's I have needed to see some discussion of generational influences of that
period and have seen very little. Usually it is something BEAT. When it is
something BEAT, we tend to see that period through Buddhist filter. Ira
brings us the India filter, the psychedelic, maximal filter, and so lays out
a significant cultural influence which is misunderstood or ignored in
contemporary poetry histories. His influence has been enormous but neglected
and I am not sure why. There is a retrospective on Ira, and links to his
work online at Big Bridge (see contributor's list). I could go on and on
about him but this is not the place. I have copied his bio below.

Dear readers:

My blog, Ann Margaret Bogle blog, undergoes changes, revisions, and
additions, even editions*, and is ready for viewing and reviewing.

Neglected calumny soon expires. -- Tacitus

Contents

*What is a blog?  What is a bogle? autobio. intro.
Author photo, 1998
Subj:Re:Doing time behind the bars of america -- womyn in prison, autobio.
*Rida, rida ranka, Swedish folk song
Author photo, 2002
*Trent Kesey, a dream.

Tzara, 1987.
"Head," poem, 2001.
"F.I.T.S.," Fathers in the Schools, autobio.
*Six poems

I have posted twelve poems at the blog.  The strangest timing:  Elizabeth
Bishop's poems in the Jan. 23 The New Yorker, especially the poem, "At A Cheap
Hotel ... ," coincided with my posting, that morning, the passage "First Sex."
The same morning, I had given thought to posting her poem, "Letter to N.Y.,"
and wrote "First Sex" instead, unaware that her previously unpublished poems
were in the current issue.

The twelve poems are as follows:

*"Get Me To the Church on Time," 1991 & 2006.
"Poem for Spring," 1996.
"It's the end of a cycle ... ," 1995.
"Florence's Weekend," 1985.

  I thought your question was an honest one, where you wished someone to say so if they knew all of the poets on the list. I don't know why you would wish to berate someone for addressing the question you asked.


  You asked if anyone knew all of the people on your list. I do. I still do. Take me at face value on this. I did not say I knew all of the poets as a way to make me better than others, I am already quite wonderful and I don't see how this knowledge would change that fact. I did not say the list was not a good idea or anything else to warrant your silly ire & attack.

  Talen was a friend of Spaulding Grays. I have seen him perform, he has no books of poetry out that I am aware of. Now do I win something?

  The spots to add comments are those marginalia areas nobody reads so, while I was aware of them, I did not fill one of those out.





Be well

p.s. is it always bad to be neglected?  isn't neglecting  someone a way of
paying attention to them in reverse?  the  people who have backs turned to them
will be paid attention to by  the people who don't like the ones turning the
backs, yes?

If "digital" defines this nicely, then why call it "electronic" instead? The
term "Electronic Literature" would seem to be more comprehensive than the
digital, but it is defined by the 'electronic writers' to be 'digital
writing', to start with the digital. There is a pretense to a wider
historical scope than it comprehends and also a dissmissal, not a
comprehension, of the earlier electronic work.

So then we consider "Digital Literature" instead. And in that case, the
appellation 'digital' is quite appropriate but the term 'literature' is a
wee bit on the way out. Whereupon we arrive at something like "Digital
Poetry" and, even there, the print poets resent the 'liberties' taken with
the notion of poetry in the more interesting 'digital poetry'. This is not a
problem, though, of course, in that the battle of poetry against itself and
the forces of dullness is ongoing, and notions of what poetry is, can be,
will be, are constantly in flux--and this is healthy.

ps: just got back from a trip to saturna island (in the gulf islands, ie,
the same bunch as the san juan islands, as they are called in the usa) with
brazil's marcus bastos; we met lionel kearns there. in 2004 marcus
translated a piece i did called 'on lionel kearns' (
http://vispo.com/kearns ). the power went out on saturna the full time we
were there, so the three of us ate, drank, and talked about various arts and
life/lives by candlelight and a warm fireplace. next day went for a walk.
william gibson lives down the road and, not far from him, a young retired
geneticist building an extrordinarily well-windowed house by the ocean. west
coast countrified, perhaps.

thence to vancouver where we met with peter courtemanche, media arts curator
of the western front gallery. the four of us visited surrey art gallery,
where there are several digital arts projects exhibited including,
currently, the work of leonard paul (who teaches computer game audio) and
reva stone (who does installation work concerning robotics, genetics, 3d
graphics, voice recognition...). then across the city to see the video and
photographic work of stan douglas. finally to the ubc museum of anthropology
and its amazing collections of west coast native artifacts in
visual-sculptural languages.

and somehow the topic of poetry was in much of our talk together, as all of
us share a background and interest therein, and it is part of our work in
media arts, a focus, even, of that work.

Dear Poetics-list,

Just finished watching, Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession, the excellent
documentary (by Alexandra Cassavetes) on Jerry Harvey who, besides
pioneering paid tv movie programming, did so much to resurrect almost-lost
film classics, by the likes of Altman, Cimino, Welles, Peckinpah and others.
It's a testament to how the life of an artwork is truly collective,
extending beyond the efforts of those "immediately" involved.  Film-makers
recognized Harvey--despite his tragic end--as for all practical purposes one
of them, for his selfless and passionate efforts.

CA Conrad similarly worked his butt off putting together this list of
"neglected" poets, and many (not all) of the contributors obviously put time
and care into bringing forward some names that most of us (except a few
omniscient types) had probably never heard of--a great opportunity for
extending our knowledge of poetry (whether or not we ultimately share the
appreciation) and for honoring, if not resurrecting, unjustly neglected
work.  It's a testament to the collective nature of our endeavor.

Sure, "neglected" is a relative, perhaps problematic term, and sure, it's an
intimidating judgment to be asked to make (presuming some kind of
"objective" or comprehensive knowledge of the art), and it might be
pretentious to presume to rescue or uncover "lost" poets (when it may be we
who are lost), etc.  Whatever--we've got to start somewhere.

I imagine CA was really looking forward to the conversation around some of
these names--ideally, to learning more about them.  I certainly was.

But what do you have to offer us, dear Poetics-list, other than an extended
debate about whether or not Michael Palmer, Muriel Rukeyser and Lorine
Niedecker, etc. are neglected!?

HELLOOOO . . .  Folks, can we pull our heads out of the sand for just a
moment!?

I guess the reluctance to address the substance of the list only proves its
point: that there's a lot there for us to explore and learn about.  See you
at the library . . .

Notes from new palestine: oh gracious israel the agressive violence of
the oppressor


     b.u.t. here we are now, with israeli trained police in toronto as
the city goes crazier than the gaza on a moving day and waiting to
encrease military budgets so our gay friendly troops can go die for
israel and slaughter some iraqis and now iranians – for the same
illogical parasitic settler plantation = israel. And if we object to
this curious misadventure – we get sent to the police department,
harassed and our muslims neighbours get to be threatened and their faith
disrepected and even sent to a special prison, just like in the u.s. and
israel.


Notes from new palestine: oh gracious israel


"walkin' round thinking that the world owes you something 'cause you're
here/You goin' out the world backwards like you did when you first come
here” – staple singers


"...to me it's putting an equal sign between the opressed and the
oppressor; "it's all the same" and that's why it's so problematic.
because there is no equal sign between the defensive violence of the
oppressed and the agressive violence of the oppressor. one has nothing
to do with the other" -- Joyce Chediac (Lebanese American of the
"workers world forum") -- '"Munich" What Steven Spielberg left out


one would have to ask - does kkkanada have a hate law only for one
people claiming a monopoly of suffering, struggle and pain? and all
others are to be slaves to humilation, disrespect, harassment and
threats? and even to surrender our lives for/to them? Is this what we
are to become as we grow and join the world arena as a people and not
the quiet little joke and shadow of the u.s.?

in our time this country was one which granted a fairness to all peoples
– b.u.t. as the search for indentity – an evil word – became obsessive,
sectarianism took hold. Here we became a ornery people at each others
throats lost in the paranoia of a broken people despertaely after others
people’s lands and living the lie of historical revisionism of the
middle east and the aparthied of africa (south).

b.u.t until this call for an identity – we did,especailly after the
french said NO to colonization in quebec and faught for their culture,
respect difference and never cow towed to any one people over another.
This country was never a lap dog to any one group.
It kissed ass eqaully.

we have had irish who brought culture, like the french, natives,
puetogues, arabs, west indians and italians to montreal. The jews, prior
to being CONNED sumed in the paranoia of the middle east and
surrendering to euro fascist hate tricks, were great socialist and
taught the peoples how to be, competing with the irish, real radicals
for all peoples’ in struggle (that’s right karl marx was jews – he just
took g-d out of laws and questioned the slavery aspects of the torah).
Muslim’s questioned slavery b.u.t. never took allah/g-d out of the mix
fo social justice = marxism/socialism without the eurocentricism.

And this country was always there to clean up the errors and tragedies
other countries had maded – from hurricane carter, to stashing black
panthers and vietnam vets and going to hear an imprisoned paul robeson
sing at the boarder for them to burying the poor in anonymous graves in
halifax when our people took boats out to rescue the survivors of the
titanic -- even reclaim the drowned bodies back and give them resting
place in the native’s earth, the peoples of this country never surrender
to massive paranoia, disregard for human life and hate…

…and the chinese who were brought here as slaves to build our railroads
– and, to the lord’s grace, stayed to flouish.

…and, like most countries, we have the natives who, like palestinians,
have been displaced; their land stolen and their people ethinically
cleansed, in some instances, and with the few surviving, like radiated
sephardi child for ringwarm, experimented on, molestated and made the
victims of enviromental racism – b.u.t like the palestinians, their
youth have reclaimed their culture are making a stand where losing ain’t
an option.

we have the ukranians who struggled with poverty and the enviroment to
give this country a center and a heart…and lets not mention all the
races and ethnicities who risk their lives to make sure we have oil from
this land – not other peoples’.

the scottish who, being a bit annoying, still to this day are working
their asses off for this country. …and you gotta like the kilts and the
sweaters.

the blacks who were our first constables and militia (is that something
to be proud of? hmmmm) and who helped build british columbia after
coming up from u.s. slavery and even ended up writing a few trippy books
and some recite odd poetry….and like the irish and the french don’t like
being kicked around and die like they live ..*with pride*, inshallah.

and the arab and muslim and iranian communities who we all got along
with for decades – just FINE - until we were made to preoccupy our time
with a miscalculation of, those, south of the boarder and, their rush
for greed and a failed military arm in the middle east wrongly called a
*state* called israel.

no big -- this country welcomed the palestinians and many peoples
displaced by the u.s. imperialism and they contributed beautifully—until
we were told (recently), by a lost the paranoid broken people,
desperately after others people’s lands and living the lie of historical
revisionism of the middle east, africa (south) – and in a rush for oil –
that we were *not* suppose to love our neighbour – because a few people
got paid off to sale this country out and make sure we were divided and
at each others throats while the imperialist remained united – and scared.

…so we were to join in on the ethnic cleansing and theft of land – sorta
like what we’re guilty of with the natives -- or all the members of this
country who wished to remain true to its spirit and one time search for
freedome justice equality were subjected to holocaus logic -- monitored,
harassed, humiliated and sent off to internment camps.

i guess that's why this country has always been so noble when it came to
the palestinians during u.n. meetings -- because it knew, at one time --
a good people and a just cause -- it was a way of saying that what
happened to the natives was wrong. That it could not be, like israel and
the u.s., hypocritical about freedome, justice equality and even that
word that has two faces like nuclear proliferation – *democracy*.

b.u.t. here we are now, with israeli trained police in toronto as the
city goes crazier than the gaza on a moving day and waiting to encrease
military budgets so our gay friendly troops can go die for israel and
slaughter some iraqis and now iranians – for the same illogical
parasitic settler plantation = israel. And if we object to this curious
misadventure – we get sent to the police department, harassed and our
muslims neighbours get to be threatened and their faith disrepected and
even sent to a special prison, just like in the u.s. and israel.

…whats’ so odd is we take this insult and abuse as they laugh all the in
our faces like a spoiled brat in the sand boxes pushing us around and
running to the prinicipal when we fight back – b.u.t. their parents, in
the u.s., who own the town mill like, richard cory, won’t stop correct
the problem of the lachkey kid, and give them a good scottish wack
across the butt or knuckles, that they deserve and get them to respect
others and get along with rest to the planet. Nah, they’ll just fire
you’re parents or send the strike breaker thugs (now called *security
experts*) to break your arm, your leg, you other leg your other arm and
your head; call it *democracy* and make you say ‘thank you’.

We must love our new friends or our leaders don’t get kick backs – just
like the neo-cons. So I ask you? was our identity to become oppressive
like bad amerikkka or paranoid and sociopathic like that robber baron
bastard estate of israel?

We lost our pride along with our minds I’ll tell you that much.

Maybe, we should start building a wall around british columbia to keep
toronto out as a final act of our fear and defeat. Then we could import
othe people to do our fighting for us or like a coward in a street fight
beg his lads and the cops to come help him when he’s losing from the
mess he started after the pub.

what is further curious we are doing this all for those who claim to
have a passion for this so called *jewish state* (although christians
and muslims have lived there for centuries – and christians believe
christs tomb is there and muslim believe the prohet isa/jesus (pbuh)
taught there and kicked butt against the imperialist of that time --
those who wanted to *build a wall* of opression between the people and
their faith for the sake of monies – things shu have change, huh?) and
have the right to return (aliya), therefore; must then commit to
military service (fight PHYSICALLY-- FACE TO FACE) -- why don’t these, I
guess they are called *zionists* do so and face the palestinians they
claim are animals, ungovernable, who they laugh at when the children are
shot in the head and other lives are taken and whose religion, for those
who are muslim, mock and wish for their death and imprisonment – up
close, instead of harasseing citizens of this country, destroying our
freedome and co-opting our police dept and government?

Colonist have always imported their soldiers/poor to die for them –
soldiers have replaced slaves it’s seems.

Why can’t people who have the such wonderful right to return to such a
promised plantation, go…and kill an arab (they treat like an inferior
race – what was the lesson of the holocaust?) and raid iran and do what
this country has always believed in – pull yourslef up by your boots --
d.i.y. and get ‘er done – even if it meant manning ships, in the middle
of the night to pull the bodies of the neglected poor, trapped in sealed
lower decks to drown for the rich …from the colonies … because it’s
captain was too arogant to see that what, apeared easily moveable, had
roots deep into this world, was tough and strong of nature’s will and
could turn over the biggest bullies with all the technology. It wasn’t
casting shadows. It was the real thing up close – a mighty creation
where moving was not an option.

b.u.t. maybe if you had just listened and gone around it – it might,
have, just like saying ‘excuse me’, ‘may I please’ and ‘thank you’, have
been a bit more polite. B.u.t. your parents, despite being from the
south, what own that mill, never bothered to teach you manners or, as
sister mavis onces preached “…put your hand o'er your mouth when you
cough that'll help the solution “

…and the maybe people might have respected you more oh gracious israel.

Among the most neglected poets in America are the many that don't write
in English. Unlike James, Kees, Cha, etc., disappearing doesn't even
become part of how they are remembered. Aside from the very few who get
translated (or translate themselves), they have no aura, leave no
trace. Just some fishy odor.

Also, those that were struck down by aerial bombardment, napalm, etc.
They weren't in America, but America got to them, into and all around
them. Definitely hit by neglectorinos. Kim Young-nang, for example, one
of the great lyric poets of modern Korean. Forgesigxis.

I haven't looked into this lately, but some years back I was intrigued to see
how frequently the traditional "poets' corner" could still be found in local
foreign language newspapers -- When I lived in San Jose, several of the
regional Vietnamese and Spanish language papers carried poems by both readers
and "professional" poets --

Which circles back to the question, "what do we mean neglected?" The
poets in those newspapers were known to their local language
communities, but probably not to their anglophone neighbors. Cases in
point: I publish a number of people from other cultures, some of whom
live in the US. Mervyn Taylor, whose third book, Gone Away, I've just
issued, is from Trinidad. He's well-known there, as poets go--a
front-page spread in the largest newspaper, for instance, and
inclusion in most anthologies of the region. Barely known beyond the
West Indian community in the States. Jose Kozer, a Cuban living in
the US since 1960, has been published and given readings in almost
every Spanish-speaking country. There are books about his work, and
among readers of poetry he's something of a celebrity. But not in the
country where he lives, although some of his poems have been
translated by the likes of Gregory Rabassa and Edith Grossman, Amiel
Alcalay translated two chapbooks, and my own traslations and those of
others have been appearing for the past few years in journals and
ezines. I'll be publishing Stet: Selected Poems of Jose Kozer later
this year, but I doubt it will make him a household name here. Are
Mervyn and Jose neglected?

Here's another one. Chris Winks is translating the Cuban poet Lorenzo
Garcia Vega, another great poet (I use the term advisedly) living
among us. For years he worked as a grocery pcker in a Florida
supermarket. Again, well-known in Latin America. Anyone heard of him?

Which leads to my own hobbyhorse, the relative ignorance in this
country of even the foreign cultures alive withinn our own borders.
Add the complication of language, and you get a situation where even
the very best poets writing in Spanish, say, may be unknown or
virtually so in the States. Transmission seems to be haphazard at
best, in part because we have so few decent translators, and faced
with the mass of available material they naturally chose what they
find attractive at the moment. So we all know Neruda, but few are
aware of Zurita, an astonishing Chilean poet, for instance.

A neglected US poet in my own estimation, I nonetheless think that
this parochialism is a bigger issue--there's more to learn, and not
just about poetry, by diving into these cultures.

kudos to Shanna Compton for putting Joan Murray's fine, strange, and very
cool work online and for tooting her horn in the Neglectorino Project. i
just printed out a copy of Murray's book, which Shanna links there, and am
enjoying her wonderfully idiosyncratic poetry . . . hard to believe that
she died at only 24.

We'd definitely be interested, Alex!

Please ask writers to carefully review the submission guidelines before
submitting their writings to madhattersreview@gmail.com.  Our reading perio=
d
for Issue 5 will end this coming Friday.

We are also interested in translations of works by authors who don't write
in English. Our aesthetic is not traditional or mainstream.  It's spelled
out in our About and Editor's Rave pages.  In our next issue, we will be
presenting a special section consisting of Raymond Federman's English
translations of poems by avant-garde French poets.

Thanks, all!

I suspect part of this 'parochialism' is a Regan through the current Bush
legacy of cultural insularity. Imagine, beginning with Regan, a the chorus
for children was "Don't talk to strangers."Tho aimed at potential
kidnappers, it was metaphoric of the time (concurrent, for example, with
anti-immigrant initiatives - i.e., "don't speak Spanish"), a way of
demonizing "the other" - now carried over to Muslims, etc.

This contrasts with the Sixties where the momentum was the opposite - "we"
left home a quickly as possible. To know, be among, join with "the other"
was the challenge, excitement, etc. It was, parenthetically, a time in which
many poets took up the challenge of translation, Latin American poets much
among the translated.

By the 80's - and I am probably going out on a limb here - the interest went
to "theory" as the new "other."  Interest and reciprocation, domestically,
for example, in and with "Third World" poets and poetries, became much
dissipated. How much an obsession with "theory" may be equated with a fear
of "person(s)" is, I suspect, open to question.

Finally, it appears, instead of an openness to "otherness" - and all the
adventure, risk, and, occasionally, the wonderful embarrassing stupidities
that may occur within this realm - we are back to an age, it appears, of

Stephen --

I have to say I'm one of those who would have a lot of questions about how
"theory" is working in your hypothesis -- as I've been mentioning in recent
writings, I'm hardly alone in having to come to issues in theory such as
questioning of the Cartesian subject and rebellion against the insularity of
the New Criticism via readings of Fanon, Baraka, C.L.R. James etc. -- In the
current "culture wars," the right has taken pretty much the opposite tack from
what you conjecture, arguing that "theory" and an interest in "suspect"
cultural diversity went hand in hand--

Hey, thanks for the Italian-American props everybody, but i thought I'd
change up the suffix of this ever expanding thread's subject heading...

Anyway, more importantly, I wanted to at least make a nod to this very
interesting debate that is developing between Aldon and Stephen.

I don't have time right now to get too deep into this,
but I wanted to say that I think that these two positions need not be
opposed---. I personally found myself agreeing with much of what Stephen
said, and feel that potential strategies for what can be done today in the
face of the "legacy of cultural insularity" and the Reagan reaction to much
of the cultural opening of which Stephen speaks is something that needs
to be confronted more than believe it currently is on the "left" etc...

At the same time, I agree with Aldon that positing the issue as
"translation" vs. "theory" (one being good, one being not so good)
itself could be as much a manifestation of this "insularity" as
Stephen claims the move toward "theory" itself is.
There's the danger of once again, the "divided left" syndrome,
which is itself a legacy of the "counter culture" vs. "labor"
divisions that were manifested (and exploited by Reagan, or before him
Nixon, etc) in the 1960s.

What would be needed would be at least a coalition (respectfully aware of
the differences of course) of "translation" and "theory" as the terms
are operating in this Nielsen/Vincent debate----but I think Stephen
raises some bigger existential questions that go beyond this particular
debate. Especially worth singling out in Stephen's quotes is the legacy of
DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS (or as Jello Biafra put it in the late 1980s---
STAY IN YOUR HOMES!) and this ending, which I'll quote again

instead of an openness to "otherness" - and all the
>> adventure, risk, and, occasionally, the wonderful embarrassing stupidities
>> that may occur within this realm - we are back to an age, it appears, of
>> paranoia and surveillance - one in which 'we' may live in fear (for politics
>> and/personal association) of being perceived by those in authority as being
>> a dangerous "other."

I think I can quote this favorably, without necessarily siding against Aldon
and his position---I.e. "theory" (as Aldon figures it) does not have to
opposed to what Steven is saying. It CAN be, and sometimes (maybe OFTEN) is
used as a form of self-policing, but it NEED not be. Conversely, one NEED
not "take it to streets" like, say, the young Abbie HOFFMAN in order to be
open to such "embarrassing stupidities" of which Vincent speaks....

Sometimes I feel when I go on like this I'm being
1) TOO obvious
2) too "utopian" (it's "easier said than done")

but unless this stuff is talked about, and a better understanding is
arrived, so many of the "best minds of my generation" will not be
allowed to contribute to the betterment of cultural life, and instead
will continue to fall through the crack of the various "open minded"
authorities as, for instance, "too much of a 'street poet'
for the LANGUAGE POETS and too much of a 'LANGUAGE POET'
for the 'street poets'"----to give but one example of this insular legacy
caused by a large number of cultural practices ostensibly
beyond our control....

"beyond our control" in the sense of "in SOMEONE ELSE's control"
not that we could "take control" per se, but at least to debunk theirs---

Chris

It was an astounding event. Apparently he's bigger than McLuhan.
South Korea
is building a big museum dedicated to his oeuvre. The Smithsonian has
a lot
of his work on display.

All the avant-garde luminaries were there. Speeches were given by
Yoko Ono,
Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, Bill Viola, and yours truly (I told
some MM/Paik stories). Telegrams from the President of Korea, the German
culture czar, the Smithsonian, etc. His nephew was the best. Here's
how he
ended his talk:

"This is an interesting story I'll tell you. Aside
from trying to keep him liquid, this is one of the
most interesting things I did with him. In 1998,
Nam June was invited to a state dinner at the
Clinton White House, June of '98. If some of you
remember, it's not that long ago, that was the
height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which
had broken out earlier, in January or February.
Nam June was going, and he asked if I would go
with him. So I said, sure. I went with him. I
wheeled him into the White House, and these gigantic
Marines took over from there. Nam June
was very amused, I think. He was having a great
time, talking to all the people there.
Then we got to the receiving line. Nam June decided
to show respect, I think, to the president,
Mrs. Clinton, and the other dignitaries there. He
decided to get up from his wheelchair, get on his
walker, and try to walk across the receiving line.
Across the receiving line at the state dinner is the
World's press. They're all there; I don't know how
many, tens of cameras and video cameras, everything.
So as Nam June is talking to President Clinton,
and I'm standing right behind him as he's
making some small talk to President Clinton,
Nam June turns around and says to me: Ken,
I think my pants are falling. True story here. And
I said, What? My pants are falling! he says. I
look down, and his pants are falling! They are
completely down on the floor. And he has no underwear on!
So I pick up his pants. I pull them up and I just hold them there.
Now, Bill Clinton is such a cool president he
still continued to have small talk with my uncle. I
think they were talking about Chelsea, maybe, I
don't know. A little bit down the line, I could see
that Hillary was really not amused at all. She was
ticked. But Bill Clinton was saying nothing. It was really
quite amazing.

After that interesting dinner, Nam June was inundated
with phone calls, faxes, everything. All his
friends around the world thought that was the
best Fluxus performance in the world. Everybody
wanted to know, including the press, whether it
was an accident or whether it was, because you
have to remember, my uncle is in a wheelchair
now but he has a reputation for being a cultural
terrorist. So I asked Nam June, did you drop
your pants on purpose? Was it an act? Was it an
artistic statement? A political statement? And so
he said, My pants dropped. That's all. He told
me, and this is very Nam June, he said, It really
doesn't matter. It was a great event.
He's just like that, totally unfazed. Was he
embarrassed? No, of course not! And I think
Bill Clinton was very cool about that, too. The
press was so excited that somebody else's pants,
not the president's, had dropped in the White
House. They were so excited by that. It was the
ultimate Fluxus event.

About two hours ago, I called Nam June and I
told him I was going to receive this Medal for him,
and I asked him, What advice do you have for
the artists in the Colony? I'll pass on to you what
he said. He said, Work hard. Be lazy - which is a
very Nam June Paik thing to say. And he wished
you all well. Thank you very much."

At the end of the memorial today, the nephew handed out about fifty
scissors
and asked everyone to cut off the tie of the man next to you or you
wouldn't
be allowed in the reception. Everyone cut off their neighbor's tie
and then
Yoko suggested everyone put the pieces in Nam's open casket. Everyone
did.

More amazing things happened at the reception.


Bob Dobbs


P.S. Since he was a "global artist", Paik asked to be buried in 10
countries.

There is a short video of Yoko Ono speaking at the wake at
<http://www.dvblog.org/movies/02_2006/yoko_nam_june_paik.mov>.

I wanted desperately to be there but no flight from L.A. wd get me to
New York in time without disrupting my finances and schedule of
"important" appointments and deadlines out here. Now I'm thinking: How
could I not have gone? The more I remember Nam June Paik (his Korean
name wd be pronounced Paeng Nam-june), his work, and his dilemmas, the
more I realize how deeply influenced I was by him. Some transitions one
must attend no matter what.

I think anyone who spent more than a few minutes with Nam June must
have a great anecdote to tell.

Once at a dinner at his loft (I think he was still a squatter there at
the time), he impishly disappeared again and again throughout the
evening while his partner, the video artist Shigeko Kubota, valiantly
played hostess to the curators I had tagged along with. Sometimes we'd
find him sitting cross-kneed under the dining table, other times
reclining behind a pile of large storage boxes. He had a cold. At the
end of the evening, he took a large bowl of wasabi with him into his
makeshift editing booth; apparently he was going to pinch wads of it in
his nose to clear his sinuses and stay awake all night.

I loved his impromptu lectures on street corners in the East Village
and Soho, standing in 2 am shadows. He had been in voluntary exile from
S. Korea and nearly cut off by his family, who were ashamed of his
antics, but by the mid-80s, Seoul wanted to be forgiven by him and
enticed him back as it entered the international cultural stage
big-time with its hosting of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Olympics. He
obliged with nationally broadcast pieces that mystified, even angered
most of the Korean audiences of the time. (They had been expecting
something along the lines of a good TV movie that showed Korean values
to the world.) He became famous for showing up on evening talk shows
and doing nothing but laughing, pulling strange faces, or providing
incoherent answers to his hosts' clueless questions. It reminded me of
some of Harpo Marx's best scenes. I would watch gleefully with my
aunt's family, who always concluded that he was insane. And that I was
an idiot (pabo) for trying to shoot his every appearance (and that of
my favorite pop singers) directly from the TV screen with an antiquated
super-8 camera.

In the middle of winter, in the early 1980s, he wd regularly show up
near midnight at a Korean Japanese restaurant on Bleecker St. near NYU
to pick up 4 or 5 orders of hot beef soup (komt'ang). He sometimes had
a suggestion for a book topic that might make me rich. I think the last
one was to write about the life and death of a kamikaze pilot. He
didn't think one had been written yet. I was lazy and never wrote such
a book.

My father attended the same high school as Nam June and his older
brother did, who was my father's classmate. The Japanese Imperial Army
was hurting for money and there was a box for contributions in the
classroom. Everytime my father spoke Korean instead of Japanese by
mistake, he had to go up and deposit a coin as punishment. One day
there was a special ceremony because the Paik family had contributed
enough money to build an entire Mitsubishi Zero fighter plane. Nam June
never hid the fact that his family had been very prosperous merchants
for many generations, originally (he said) selling Korean ginseng at a
great profit in China. But until about the age of 50, he was always on
the edge of destitution and was frequently in poor health (he seemed to
suffer from gastrointestinal problems all the time and so wore a thick
scarf around his belly to keep it warm). When my father visited his
brother in Japan, or other people w whom he had grown up and were now
financially well-off, they would always shake their heads over how much
they had tried to help or advise him to be proper and successful, how
hopeless he was, how the family had to cut off financial support b/c he
was so irresponsible, etc. That was their attitude even after he became
an international art superstar. Clearly, if Nam June had stayed in
Korea he would never have been allowed to develop as an artist and
inventor. Now his influence there is incalculable.

My first memory of his work was when I was walking to the Whitney Art
Museum to see its first big Paik show. What a great exhibit that was!
But before I got there, I noticed that Madison Ave. was oddly quiet and
empty. The street had been cordoned off. From about two blocks away I
head a gradually increasing racket approaching from the downtown
direction. It was Paik's famous robot slowly whirring, clanking, and
constantly almost collapsing as a madly working crew of three young men
dove in and out, whirled, tinkered, jumped, and ran all around it at
Nam June's frustrated commands to reconnect that lead, tighten the
screws of that appendage, replace that battery, as he followed behind
with what seemed to be a useless remote control box. A crowd gathered
and cheered the robot and its sweating, dedicated attendants on as it
somehow managed to get all the way up and into the museum entrance.

During that same exhibit Nam June reenacted some of his past
performances with Charlotte Morman. I was about 22 years old then and
in utter awe of Nam June. A mutual friend introduced us, Kyunghee Jin,
the stylish librarian of Brown University's East Asian collection (whom
I had a crush on) and whose late husband had been a physicist studying
in Germany when Nam June was also studying there. He seemed very
nervous before the show. There was a multimonitor, simulcast piece that
wasn't going well. So he just ended up crashing a tool into the screen
of the malfunctioning TV set and declared that the piece was over.
There was a large shimmering glass tank of water that Charlotte jumped
into (my memory of it is vague, maybe Nam June was the one who went in,
who knows maybe I have it all wrong). There was a piece where he
started at one end of the performance space and, holding his right arm
out, began to describe an arc through the air with his finger as he
walked slowly to the other end, which is also where Mrs. Jin and I were
sitting. His finger came slowly down toward us and he touched my
forehead. He held his finger there for what seeme to be a very long
time. I felt silly in my navy blue suit and sweated nervously under his
touch. I didn't know how to react and just sat there silently. I felt
that he must be disappointed but now I'm sure he didn't care. During
the many years that have passed since then I forgot that evening. But
since I didn't go to his wake--and I feel more and more ashamed of it
as each minute passes--I have had to remember one of my artistic heroes
on my own. Wonderfully, how he touched me has returned. Forgive me for
saying that I wish to lift my own hand to hold his so that I will never
forget again. A great person's passing reinspires his mourners. His
death is not possible.

CEPA/JUSTBUFFALO COMBINED WORKSHOP STARTS SATURDAY

Between Word And Image
Saturday, February 11, 12-4 p.m.
Instructors: Caroline Koebel And Kyle Schlesinger
=2450, =2440 members

All forms of writing are images, but not all images are forms of writing. O=
r are they?
This multimedia poetry workshop will explore the relationships between word=
s and
images. What effect has the evolution of new media had on the literary and =
visual arts
of the last fifty years? What are the distinctions between the languages of=
 visual and
literary arts? What are the ramifications of blurring these boundaries? Pai=
nters, poets,
filmmakers, collage, book and installation artists have a longstanding hist=
ory of
collaboration. In the first half of this workshop we will examine various e=
xamples of
poems inspired by visual art forms and vice versa. In the second half parti=
cipants will
engage in a series of poetic experiments in response to the other forms of =
visual art
using a variety of media and materials. Writers and artists working in all =
mediums are
welcome.

Caroline Koebel's work roams between film, video and installation art. She =
is also
curator, writer and Professor of Media Studies at SUNY Buffalo whose postco=
nceptual
artworks often confront the problematics of female being-in-the-world, the =
expression
of subjectivities at odds with commodity culture, and how individuals embod=
y the
collective past. Kyle Schlesinger is a poet, scholar, book artists and prop=
rietor of
Cuneiform Press. He received his Ph.D. from the Poetics Program at SUNY Buf=
falo,
and is the author of Moonlighting, Mantle (with Thom Donovan), A Book of Cl=
osings
and is currently writing on the history and ontology of book burning. Their
collaboration, Schablone Berlin (Chax Press, 2005) examines the semiotic an=
d
performative aspects of stencil graffiti culled from the streets of Germany=
's most
international metropolis.

On a related note, but not related to the question of appropriate
terminology, I'm doing research right now into the history of
computer-generated poems and came across this hilarious and bizarre
article from the June 1970 Times Literary Supplement.  Some of the
best and most baffling excerpts:

"One of the great benefits of making a computer write poetry is that
it demonstrates the truth that "every poem has a logic of its own" in
an exact way. Another benefit is that the computer poet ends with an
enhanced appreciation of real poetry.  And algorithmic poem-writing,
"the poem-game," is fun.

...That we have here a genuine new folk art creating new techniques
will emerge as soon as more business executives who have on-line
consoles in their offices find it more fun to write poems on them than
to explore the current state of the market, or to model their own
firm's production flow.

...Poem-play, of course, is a gross over-simplification of what the
true poet does, and in two respects.  The true poet starts with
inspired fragments, emerging fully formed from his subconscious; only
at a quite late stage, quite often, does he choose his frame.  So
there are (at least) three stages: orienting hunch, emergence of
inspired fragments, choice of frame.  Moreover, the true poet will
never have a fixed thesaurus.  Word-class generation goes on in him
even when sober; and the more so, not the less, the more frightened he
is, the more drunk, the more inspired."

keeping my fingers crossed for the conversion of business execs. to
"the poem-game,"

Interesting, Chris, your sense of being sandwiched and left out somewhere
between the street and the academy or, optimistically, may you be still
considered with your feets in both!
I don't think it's a dispute  with Aldon. The word "theory" remains a
provocateur - and, Aldon is quite right to point out the limits of a
know-nothing anti or counter-theoretical stance. Most of the sixties
progressive third world and domestic Latin and African-American movements
would have been running on relative "linguistic empty" if it were not for
the theoretical power of the writings of Franz Fanon among others. I am
totally with Aldon there.

My appeal, I believe, is more to the pragmatics - what to do - in the dialog
with the 'other' - particularly now in the face of an Administration intent
on defining and eliminating 'the other' as 'evil', etc. "I mean, boys, do we
really need the old New Orleans? Katrina wasn't all that bad," etc.


Mud in your (our) eye.

A historical question:

This New Year's Eve, the NYTimes published a handful of poems--Komunyakaa,
Leithauser, Heaney, Arvio, Kelly, Phillips. I can't remember the Times
having done this before, so I've done some poking around in the historical
archive to discover if this was a new idea. So far, I haven't found any
other examples of the OP-ED page going to the poets, but I wonder if anyone
on the list can recollect another example.

thanks in advance for your memories,
nicholas hengen

Stephen---

First---I apologize, for having butchered Aldon's name in the subject
heading.

Second--to reduce my post to being just about a particular feeling of "my"
being sandwiched, I feel, begs a larger issue---okay?
If you need to read it that way, fine
But, seriously (and playfully if you will), I'm glad you're with Aldon
on Fanon, etc., as am I. (on a domestic front I'd include Baraka, etc).
And maybe I should've used the word "beat" instead of "street"
but "beat" is more historically loaded, well, they're both shorthand.
But it's not just a matter of me
(or it's not a matter just of me)--
I believe you were onto something MANY others
(not "Others"--per se--though often such views do not express themselves on
this list) I've talked to are feeling today.

The "limb" you were thought you were out on in the first post
is not something you have to slink back from....

I was not trying to reduce yr post or my sense of your position - which I
see, and see well, as one of 'negotiation' between what are often polar
'City & gown' opposites. I see it as healthy. Without contraries, no
progression. To plow that education back into 'the streets.' As well, as let
the streets plow the education. The irony (is it?)of the "Continuous
Peasant"? Other than ones financial torture, I think its a productive space
from which to work.

If I "slunked" it's mainly from the to use  of the word 'theory'  which on a
list such as this can be likened to yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater!!  I
did/do not want hear the rumbling - spoken or not - to my point re 'the
other' in my original post. Yes, I suspect many are finding ourselves
abstracted from participating in and being able to respond to and work
(write) with the 'facts on the ground.'

I continue to like that moment in Mike McGee's book on pragmatism where
Frank O'Hara and (then) Leroi Jones are meeting in the Five Spot and
learning improvisatory techniques while listening to Ornette Coleman and
others  - improvisation as strategy remains, but in the current climate, it
seems a useful resource/example. Going back to the original insight of
translation, its practice, as a means to working with 'the other'. I don't
know if O'Hara and Jones called what their poems did with the music, a
'translation' - but it seems so.

The paint is still wet and the woodchips are swept into a pile in the
back hall, but it's up--including the new RADIO AHADADA.  Here's your
invite to take a look at www.ahadadabooks.com.  The old site will still
be active for a while longer until the archives are finally moved from
the old to the new facilities.  Author pages, gallery, a becy of new
on-line chapbooks, etc. are still in progress.

We'll soon be putting out a call for sound work for RADIO AHADADA.
We'll also be doing live interviews with poets and writers, commentary,
etc.  It's all pretty exciting stuff for us, and of course, we'd like
to share our excitement with you.  All best and stay tuned! Jesse Glass

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by

Gloria Frym & Bernadette Mayer

Friday, February 10, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.
Co-sponsored by the CCA MFA Program in Writing

Gloria Frym?s most recent collection of poems, Homeless at Home , won an
American Book Award in 2002.  A new collection, Solution Simulacra , is
forthcoming from United Artists Books in 2006. Frym?s other books include the
story collections Distance No Object (City Lights Books), and How I Learned
(Coffee House Press); a number of other poetry collections; and a book of
interviews, Second Stories: Conversations with Women Artists  (Chronicle
Books). The Austin Chronicle says ? Gloria Frym's Distance No Object is
possibly ahead of its time while masquerading as an elegy for an end to an
era.?


Generous, prolific, and beloved, Bernadette Mayer is one of the major figures
of her generation of experimental poets. The San Francisco Chronicle calls her
? "One of the most interesting, exciting, and open of late-20th century

That's interesting, thanks, Lori. Of course the idea so far back would only
unusually have been anything other than what we read in the article:
"computer poets" write programs that get computers to write poemy poems.

Concerning "folk art", I've read of the way programming is handled described
as "folk art" before: often, people who aren't programmers still need to
cobble code together so they use other peoples' scripts. Contrast with
Frédéric Durieu's approach:  "...the aim of all this is to create poetry.
So, I like to speak about algorithmic poetry. A poem is a text that procures
you poetry if you read it. The code I'm trying to write is a text that
procures you poetry if a computer reads it for you...." (from
http://www.turbulence.org/curators/Paris/durieuenglish.htm )

Concerning biz execs etc., I recall reading someone on Rhizome noting, in
passing, that much of the .com era artist-programmer java net works were by
NY city programmers working in the financial district.

Personally, I've never been particularly interested in trying to get a
computer to write poemy poems. Instead, changing/expanding notions of what
poetry is seems better suited to what computers have to offer poetry and
poets.

Claire Dinsmore published Cauldron & Net at
http://www.studiocleo.com/cauldron . The last issue, issue 4, came out in
autumn 2002.

I agree that it was an unusually good online publication. In its diversity
and design.

A lot of the work came from people from the Webartery list, in an earlier
phase of that list. Webartery wasn't the only source, by any means, but
quite a bit of the work did come from subscribers or former subscribers.

However, by the time the work appeared in Cauldron & Net, most of it had
already had URLs of it posted to Webartery and the work had already been
discussed on the list, so usually, for people on Webartery, the occassion of
a new Cauldron & Net was mostly a framing of work, with which they were
already familiar, that had come out over the previous year, so it wasn't as
exciting as it hopefully was/is to people not on Webartery. Consequently,
there wasn't much discussion on Webartery when the last couple of issues
came out, which undoubtedly was discouraging for Claire. Although looking at
them now, they are more interesting to me than when they came out, which is
a good sign. I'm not as familiar with most of the work as I was when
Cauldron came out.

Claire was perhaps going for something that might be of interest long past
the publication date. Maybe she has done that.

Also, it was around that time that the involvement of Webartery in Web art
kind of hit the skids. That may have had something to do with the end of
Cauldron & Net. But, also, it may be that Claire had done what she wanted to
do with Cauldron & Net after 4 issues. At that time, it was getting fairly
well-known among people interested in online publications which featured
some sort of synthesis of media and arts--and there was always a strong
literary dimension to it. At the time, I read several people not from
Webartery describing it as one of the most interesting online publications.

Claire's background is in the visual arts and in design. Here is a talk with
her from 1999 when she published the first issue of Cauldron & Net:

But where is Claire Dinsmore?  We got to know each other years ago via the net and then in person.  I lost touch with her a few years ago, that is, her emails to me and to the list inexplicably stopped.  Any information will be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to backchannel.

Two issues on board make me wonder about other sites for magazines of
digital poetry (where part or whole of the e-mag is devoted to the type of
work which is made to work on the computer). I've collected a few, but I'm
sure the list can list many more.

from /Don't Let Me Be Lonely/
by Claudia Rankine

There was a time I could say no one I knew well had died. This is not to suggest
no one died. When I was eight my mother became pregnant. She went to the
hospital to give birth and returned without the baby. Where's the baby? we
asked. Did she shrug? She was the kind of woman who liked to shrug; deep within
her was an everlasting shrug. That didn't seem like a death. The years went by
and people only died on television—if they weren't Black, they were wearing
black or were terminally ill. Then I returned home from school one day and saw
my father sitting on the steps of our home. He had a look that was unfamiliar;
it was flooded, so leaking. I climbed the steps as far away from him as I could
get. He was breaking or broken. Or, to be more precise, he looked to me like
someone understanding his aloneness. Loneliness. His mother was dead. I'd never
met her. It meant a trip back home for him. When he returned he spoke neither
about the airplane nor the funeral.

Every movie I saw while in the third grade compelled me to ask, Is he dead? Is
she dead? Because the characters often live against all odds it is the actors
whose mortality concerned me. If it were an old, black-and-white film, whoever
was around would answer yes. Months later the actor would show up on some
latenight talk show to promote his latest efforts. I would turn and say—one
always turns to say—You said he was dead. And the misinformed would claim, I
never said he was dead. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Inevitably we get older;
whoever is still with us says, Stop asking me that.

Or one begins asking oneself that same question differently. Am I dead? Though
this question at no time explicitly translates into Should I be dead, eventually
the suicide hotline is called. You are, as usual, watching television, the
eight-o'clock movie, when a number flashes on the screen: I-800-SUICIDE. You
dial the number. Do you feel like killing yourself? the man on the other end of
the receiver asks. You tell him, I feel like I am already dead. When he makes no
response you add, I am in death's position. He finally says, Don't believe what
you are thinking and feeling. Then he asks, Where do you live?

Fifteen minutes later the doorbell rings. You explain to the ambulance attendant
that you had a momentary lapse of happily. The noun, happiness, is a static
state of some Platonic ideal you know better than to pursue. Your modifying
process had happily or unhappily experienced a momentary pause. This kind of
thing happens, perhaps is still happening. He shrugs and in turn explains that
you need to come quietly or he will have to restrain you. If he is forced to
restrain you, he will have to report that he is forced to restrain you. It is
this simple: Resistance will only make matters more difficult. Any resistance
will only make matters worse. By law, I will have to restrain you. His tone
suggests that you should try to understand the difficulty in which he finds
himself. This is further disorienting. I am fine! Can't you see that! You climb
into the ambulance unassisted.


Outside Art
by Christopher Davis

Inside Sex World, it’s hot and mute.
Amyl nitrate dumped on the cold floor
singes the air.

My eye wanders wildly,
a god flaming within me wanting
simply to stand shirtless in the sun,

his twin bright eyes shining
on the strong brown rippling
Mississippi, a boat shooting

from the shadows of the leaves under the bridge,
a church group tossing gnawed bones into a tray,
the emptiness of the experience of the experience.

In dorm rooms across America, dumb and dumber
hurt each other, limp lizards, faggot maggots, ugly
slugs, the four forlorn flipped pill bugs of eye contact.

Under anger, mother wept, there’s always fear.
An albino catfish nudges a deep sea diver
kicking open a chest of glittering treasure.

In a meadow, behind gray rocks, a girl giggles, gluing
purple sequins all over the clay bust of a baby, trying
to fix images of man.  I believe I stink like a burrito.

Mary and all,

actually the interview is with Chris Daniels, who's translating Pessoa
and others in some remarkable ways, interviewed by Kent Johnson, and
definitely worth a look as Mary says.

Very interesting... I've done my share of writings through Joyce and throug=
h Jabes. Pessoa I've been reading for a long time, been taking lots of note=
s. Anyone else interested in this venture? Hmm, this could be my third writ=
ing through. Anyone want to look at my "Sedici, Ulysses" or "qui/etude: wri=
ting through Edmond Jabes?"

Just in case I was misconstrued (see posts by Newman and Nielsen below):

My comment that non-English-writing (from hereon, "nEw") poets in the
USA are "neglected" was, of course, in ref. to Anglophone readers
ONLY--the group/discourse that the Neglectorino discussion seemed to
assume was the standard by which to judge levels or types of
recognition. I didn't mean to imply that they were neglected by
publications, potential readers, and critics in their own writing
language.

Here in L.A. it is especially easy to come across nEw poets' frequent
appearance and often prestige in newspapers, magazines, anthologies,
lectures, etc. published or conducted in other languages. One memorable
experience I had was an invitation to give a lecture in Korean to a
1st-generation Korean American literary group on general trends across
the entire US poetry scene (I tried to cover everything from Ashbery
and Baraka to Langpo and Poetry magazine in 90 minutes!). They were
very sympathetic to my halting Korean delivery and perhaps predictably
interested in names like Cathy Song and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. B/c of
their knowledge of post-'45 Korean politics, they had a different take
on leftist poetry than the crowds at the Getty or Armand Hammer Museum
wd (the biggest gathering I've seen there was for Sharon Olds). Aside
from their own work, this particular group's journal likes to devote a
good # of pages to interviews of American poets & translations of their
poetry into Korean.

I don't know if it's really crucial that nEw American poets get read in
the mainstream poetry world (unless, of course, the poets want to be).
To a certain extent, what is important about much of the work is the
very survival of another literary language or discourse vis a vis an
onslaught of English. To translate it might be to defeat much of its
purpose and perhaps amount to a further working of deathly
universalizing impulses. My friend Serk-bae Suh is presently finishing
a dissertation in which one chapter explores the idea that
translation's ideal of EQUAL exchange between languages only (a)
reifies opposing national distinctions by maintaining the idea of
distinct and unified "native" or "national" languages (here, the
critique follows the work of the Japanese cultural historian Naoki
Sakai) and (b) serves as an ideological cover for gross economic,
legal, and cultural INequalities. Serk-bae is discussing Japanese
translations of Korean lit. during the era of colonial rule (1910-45)
that were then redistributed or performed (in the case of theater) in
the colony, but I think it might be applied  to the American scene as
well, in regard to its "minorities." It opens up the questions of How
to do translation.

Besides, American literature already has plenty of reassuringly boring
stand-ins for "other" communities and cultures who write in WW Iowa
English abt the coziness, crudeness, and patriarchal horrors of other
countries (although some score extra points in alternative circles by
making a nostalgic issue of untranslatibility and using verbs
ungrmatikly or blanking where verbs were supposed to be). So why go to
the trouble of translating from another language? In this way,
multiculturalism serves as a supplement to the State Dept. and also a
safeguard against "ethnic" poets who might do something a lot more
interesting and threatening than write up the Poetry Soc. of America
version of their census form (albeit w some Hollywood or pop music
allusions thrown in).

Of course, not all of ethnic studies, multiculturalism, or area studies
reduces to such cultural politics. The more interesting critics have
opened up to more global or transnational approaches (also
psychoanalysis) that understand how hybrid, displacement-filled, and
economic language and literary form are and also their complicity
with/resistance to commodification and ideology, whether first or third
world, etc. Some even spend a lot of time in archives and make FOIA
requests to, for example, the INS, US Army, FBI, and CIA, organizations
that, unlike English departments, don't completely neglect the nEw.

Somehow, Walter - aside from what seems a legitimate or validated concern
for the history of making 'the other' palatable (as with, say, the State
Department and Karen Hughes in the Mideast in charge of making the USA
'Texas Sunday Nice Again'  - while inviting a 'colorful' spectrum of poets
and writers to the Barbeque),  I think it's important on the upside, even if
sometimes tragic, to point out those artists/writers who have jumped 'the
fence' and shaken up the entire fabric rather hugely. Lenny Bruce hops to
mind - if my history is correct - taking a street corner Yiddish comic
character tradition and lifting it into English (well sort of) in ways that
put the screws in. Taking his gift beyond the corner into clubs, records,
etc.

But, wow, did 'they' go after him.

Anyway, I think there are limits to sustaining a poetry of containment -
though I don't think that was entirely your drift.

Jim, thanks for this - I hadn't heard of Durieu before and your quote
from him is really interesting - especially since I understand him to
be saying that a text is only a text if it is read and so the issue
with computer-generated poetry is not about the writing (or what we
mean by writing, or what the writing means, or who wrote it) but the
reading - which is to say the programmer is the writer and the
computer the reader?  Again, just really interesting!

Saturday February 11, 5:30 pm


Ange Mlinko is the author of Matinees (Zoland Books, 1999) and
Starred Wire (Coffee House Press, 2005), winner of the National
Poetry Series.  "The poems have the grace to live as variously as
possible; they occasionally share a swift and dreamy motion through
almost familiar landscapes that eventually coalesce, not into a
picturesque scene but into a sharp, complex feeling: a melancholy
bordered by delight and mortality, catching the transition between
innocent, sheltered playfulness and a darker, more adult knowledge."
(The Village Voice). She lives in New York.


Joseph Torra is the author of From the Chinese (Pressed Wafer, 2004)
and the novels of the My Ground Trilogy (Gollancz). On Gas Station: "
. . .  [part of] an entire prose tradition that includes everyone
from Kerouac to Creeley to Melville . . . " (Ron Silliman); "Torra
makes a visit to the coffee shop and the chat of the mechanics into a
kaleidoscope of high poetry." (The Guardian). He lives in Somerville.

invites submissions of poems by APA Poets for a special feature on
Asian American Poetry that will appear later this year. The title of
this issue will be: "I Will Not Love You Long Time!" He is looking for
unpublished work that has literary rigor, bombastic flair, and poetic
pheromones. He is particularly interested in considering experimental
works. Visual Poems in JPEG files, Video/film poems, Electronic poems,
and Mixedmedia poems are particularly encouraged. Traditional page
poems, of course, are also considered.

Deadline for submissions is March 1, 2006.
Email submissions to: NickCarbo@aol.com
Please include: 3-5 poems, cover letter with short bio, and a black &
white JPEG image of author.
Accepted poet will agree to provide a sound recording of him/her
reading the poem(s)
in a sound file which will be podcast for internet or ipod listeners.

I know that Claire had been having some health problems.  If anyone can
give us an up-date--b/c would be great.  Jess

Thanks Lawrence & Bruce for the great responses.  Good to know that it's
still floating out there in cyberspace weaving and weaving via
Dream-Weaver.  My hope that Claire is also still out there.

Many of the Journals have died or at least gone on Hiatus. Poemsthatgo is long due, Beehive is in storage, and others have slipped away...

  however I have made an effort to encourage print lit mags with interesting site to have electronic literature published on their sites...

  Diagram, 3rdbed, Nowculture, and others have done this and found that many of their readers came in to see the net artwork first....

  I would suspect that instead of having a numerous journals/magazines devoted to e-lit..that we need to encourage the existing ones with good and vibrant sites to include e-lit.

  In addition, as I mentioned before, much of what I would consider e-lit etc...is being published in the art world. And those within those galleries and journals are surprisingly well versed the kinds of work classified as hypertext e-lit cyberpoetry etc....75 percent of my publications/awards etcc last year came from entities who would not know of this poetics list...

  so perhaps we need a new thread here to solicit journals to open homes for wayward e-lit creatures...

Ha. Um, I'm not sure. I think I detect a touch of humour in Durieu's remark.
But also some seriousness. He really is, on occassion, a wonderful
artist-programmer in a class that few have attained. You don't need to read
the code to know it but just look at what the code produces when the
computer reads it. The writing of the code is obviously a writing by Durieu.

I like to look for what I call code ideas in programmed works. In Oeil
Complex, say, the main code idea is discussed in
http://www.turbulence.org/curators/Paris/durieuenglish.htm and is referred
to obliquely in the title of the piece (complex i, as in imaginary numbers).
That is what supports the dynamic geometry when you move the mouse around in
Oeil Complex. And you don't need to understand the mathematics of the code
idea to appreciate the dynamic geometry the code idea supports. You see that
the behavior and geometry the code idea supports is unusual and beautiful.
Yet if you also understand the mathematics of the code idea, you see that
here we have a terrific example of the relation that can exist between
mathematics and art. Also, although it is theoretically fairly complex--in
that it involves an understanding of some complex analysis--the code was
very short. A little poem. A little poem that the computer reads and turns
into art of more human interest than the code idea. Yet the code idea is of
interest to me. I like work that has fascinating code ideas that support
strong art.

The art of programming is not simply the art described by Donald Knuth in
The Art of Computer Programming, which basically consists in the right
choice and implementation of the right algorithms. That is an art of
engineering. It is not an inconsiderable art, like the technical knowledge
associated with architecture but, again like architecture, there is more to
it than the technical and mathematical. Artist-programmers not only practice
the technical and mathematical art but also integrate it with the arts as we
know them otherwise. And that integration and synthesis of the 'art' of
engineering and the art of writing, the art of visuals, the art of
animation, the arts of this and that, this synthesis is the art of
programming I am more interested in, rather than solely an art of
programming that is simply an art of engineering and mathematics.

Yet I think that for most people the 'art of programming' is, at best, a
"folk art", a cobbling together of dull code cliches. Or simply an 'art of
engineering'. I was proud of the interview with Durieu because I think it
gets at an 'art of programming' that goes beyond either of these.

Also, even were we to read Durieu's code, it would be more or less
impossible to understand, even if well-documented, without knowledge of the
mathematics that informs it. It is a machine that is put together not simply
with if-elses and repeat loops but has embedded in it the theoretical
mathematics of 'complex analysis' (ie the theory and geometry of imaginary
numbers). It lifts that theory off the page into the sinews of a new being
of considerable art and character.

It is a work of "algorithmic poetry" where the writing is by Durieu, and the
reading of the code is by the computer, which creates a piece that is
experienced as visual and interactive. It involves a notion of poetry that
does involve an intense engagement with language, but language synthesized
with mathematical logic--in this case not in sterile union but with
considerable creativity, charm, and consequence.

ja

ps: Here are a couple of more recent Durieu pieces. These are interactive
audio pieces: http://www.lecielestbleu.com/media/pixelbypixelframe.htm and

I'd like to recommend a brand new book that has really impressed me:  Feedi=
ng the Fear of the Earth by Patrick Lawler (Many Mountains Moving Press: ww=
w.mmminc.org).   Original, fun, smart, very moving.  His lines: =20
=20
"...sometimes I am sad and sometimes I crack
with joy. It's getting to be impossible
to tell the difference."

and from another poem:

=93What I want is delicate machinery to carry
pain.  What I want are carousels
for fingers, music boxes for hands.=94


From the preface by Susan Terris:

=93...the premise of the book is that well-known figures of historical and/=
or contemporary interest intersect in surprising and significant ways.....E=
mily Dickinson takes Pablo Neruda for a boat ride down the Hudson as they l=
isten to the music of Tchaikovsky.........Lawler is a professor of writing =
and literature in an Environmental Studies program and his subject matter i=
s always concerned with what man is doing to foul this environment versus t=
hose who would make it flourish...=94
=20
**Patrick is looking for reviewers and readings. (I've read with him---he's=
 a dynamite reader.)  Contact him at pjlawler at esf dot edu.

I just want to draw some quick attention to "Endocrinology" - a Kelsey
Street Press book (1997) - in my opinion an extraordinary art-poem
collaboration between Kiki Smith and Mei-mi Berssenbruge. It's newly
visible/available in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art bookshop (in
conjunction with the Kiki Smith show), and, I would suspect/hope at the
Whitney (in conjunction with the Richard Tuttle show). Tuttle, the poet's
husband, has done a number of covers for her books (and possibly full
collaborations?) The books were were are on display with Tuttle's other book
projects in the show - at least they were in San Francisco.

Anyway in "Endocrinology" the level of dialogue between the art and the
language is genuinely tops. It could well be that the poem could sit alone -
but its integration and maximization of interpretation through the play with
the art I find incredibly smart and a veritable treat - and in no way could
this email begin to exemplify.

Possibly available through SBD - I did not look - or direct from Kelsey - if
you are distant from those Museum stores.

And let me be among the first to praise Aldon's MIXAGE (Zasterle 2005), a biting, humorous, incisive commentary on the Age of the Mix--these missives (esp. Szondi in the Park, In Memory of My Failings, and The Assembly of God At Jasper) twist the tongue in cheek...

Hi Joel

Actually it was Jesse Glass who was asking; and I who reassured him that
Claire's site is still up, by quoting the url! But sometimes it gets
confusing who has contributed what as messages get partially trimmed and
becomes a series of misheard whispers

I too have lost contact with Claire=2E=2E=2E I share your esteem of her=2E=
 I
greatly valued the way that she put poetry of mine together for Vol 3=2E
However good or bad it is, the way that she worked with and for me and the=

mag had an intelligence and integrity to it that was invigorating; and I
wish her well - I hope she returns to edit some more as well

L


Lawrence:

There are no new issues, but it's still on line:

http://www=2Estudiocleo=2Ecom/cauldron/volume4/index1=2Ehtml

I don't know what happened to Claire=2E We used to be in touch, but she
didn't reply to my last e-mail, which was a long time ago=2E This seems to=

happen to people, they suddenly disappear, for which I'm sorry, as Claire
is special=2E

Best Regards,
Joel

Claire is alive and well in Pittsburgh. She's been dealing with health
problems the last while, but she sounds like her very intelligent and

Hello -

Some of you will have known something of the journal i'm putting together
called Plantarchy. The first issue is in final stages of production at 108
pages and includes work from Jow Lindsay, Chris Stroffolino, Tom Raworth,
Maria Damon, William R. Howe, Rodrigo Toscano, Lisa Jarnot, mIEKAL aND, &
Geof Huth, to name quickly just a few. It will be released soon in a
hand-bound edition of 300. Folks are already ordering subscriptions thru
PayPal, but you are more than welcome to send works for trade and review.

I wish now to invite submissions to Plantarchy 2, broadly themed towards
'performance and performativity', as the deadline happens to be the upcomin=
g
1st of April. Contributors thus far (from this list) include Piers Hugill
and Stuart Calton (and a generous sequence or chunk of work from both).
Others include rob mclennan, Ric Royer (on Michael Basinski), Michael
Basinski, Brenda Iijima, Daisy Levy, and the Performance Thanatology
Research Society. Note that at this point i am especially interested in
sequences, longish poems, and critical work. Please visit the url below for
more information...

Regards,
jUStin

Someone mentioned Joe Carderelli on the Neglecterino list and I have to
second that inclusion.  Gary Blankenberg started a new poetry press back
in 1986--87 and I got a chance to read on Joe's turf at the Maryland
Art Institute and to publish with Joe in the first Poetry Eclectic.
Good writing, great guy.  He didn't publish much, I believe.  I
remember a few mimeo things and that was about all.

I'd also like to mention Elliot Coleman, the founder of the Johns
Hopkins Writing Seminars and a definite talent.  The Maryland Writers
Council published a collection of his poems titled Tangerine Birds back
in 1977--78.  His work reminded me a bit of Creeley's more minimal
productions.  I'm sure copies are still available out there somewhere
because he's worth a lit candle or two for a lost soul.  His writing
was definitely different from what's happened there since his time.  Ed
Baker and Charles Plymell studied with him--among many others.

I'd also like to mention Robert West Lawler, an incredibly obscure
writer but an interesting one.  His only book--L-- was published shortly
after his suicide in 1977, and is available from ahadada books.

We also distribute Ikuta Press editions of Lindley Williams Hubbell and
Yoko Danno.  More information about Hubbell at the old website
www.sendecki.com/ahadada/  We're in the midst of moving, so what you
can't find at the old site look for at www.ahadadabooks.com

I've taken two writing workshops in my life, the first in high
school, the second with Elliot Coleman in 1966, when I was an
undergraduate at Hopkins. Not, apparently, my way to learn. The
workshop was a mix of the very few MFA candidates and the rest of us.
A solemn, well-mannered affair, like Episcopalian Sunday. Coleman was
patrician eminence to a fault--it was hard to imagine him bending to
drink from a water fountain. A gentle man, though he often seemed
clueless. He did have the virtue of not letting snot-nosed
adolescents throw him off his game, which was a good thing. For
instance: the first class he announced that his then only colleague
in the writing program, Richard Macksey, had just published a volume
of Donne and Marvell translated into classic Greek and Latin in his
mother's honor, and wasn't that impressive. I asked if his mother
perhaps only spoke those languages. Coleman was taken aback, but
seemed not to hold it against me.

A couple of months later I was due to present a longish poem. Coleman
began the session by announcing that TS Eliot had died the night
before, and he read us one of the four quartets. Then he turned to me
and said, "and now, Mr. Weiss, it's your turn." Nothing daunted, I
read a longish, very un-Eliot poem. Coleman homed in on one line for
comment. I disagreed, to which he replied, "TS Eliot wouldn't have
liked it." To which I answered, "Fuck TS Eliot." Which led to
something like a polite discussion of the use of poets as authority
figures. Only one student agreed with me that it wasn't helpful.

Coleman was himself very deferential to all kinds of authority. He
discouraged in his students any reaching beyond their capabilities;
it seems to me that that kind of ambition is precisely what needs to
be nurtured, though the product usually needs honing. In my case, at
any rate, he did no harm, and I got an A, like all the undergraduates.

I've never seen any of Coleman's poems. Maybe you could post one, Jesse.

My periodic reminder of the good things happening weekly over at Rock
Heals...

This week we more of less feature Ric Royer -- Baltimore-based
performance artist, with some audio recordings he put together under the
umbrella of the Performance Thanatology Research Society; a gesture
score for a past performance; and a written piece that is a score for a
performance -- or a piece of conceptual poetry, you decide. In the
coming weeks we'll have more pieces from him including some video (when
I resolve my own technical lameness).

Recently we've had poetry from a diverse set of Baltimore poets
(Gorgeous Ladies of Baltimore; GLOB): Marianne Amoss, Leslie Miller, and
Miriam Stewart.

Also of late, pieces from Bob Massey, tidbits from a visit to Sundance,
and a vispo-ish piece from Kevin Thurston.

at http://www.rockheals.com as always... and we've added an
easier-to-use archive to browse what's gone down in week's past:
http://www.rockheals.com/archives/_archive_by_week_/index.html

Hope you dig. Hope you submit your own work of varied nature. Hope you
tell us what you think.

Hi Jason,

Actually... 3rd bed has now stopped publishing too.  The final issue is due
out but there will be no more.

I also have a semi-pragmatic question for you (or others).  If you are
finding success in the in visual art world isn't that much better than
finding it in a "poetry" community (since the visual art world actually has
potential to pay)?  I have wondered in the past if there was even a way to
present poems on canvas so they could go the gallery rout and have monetary
value.  I'd think that if that rout is opening for you naturally you would
want to go for it.

A thought...

Andrea Baker (former 3rd bed poetry editor)

Hey folks.



Here's an invitation to peruse my much-belated entry in the blog marathon:
http://blog.myspace.com/orthodontist   At least I can say that I ran.



Truth be told, I was one of the very first people on the planet to have a
blog!  I set one up within a few months of the launch of Blogger.com, kept
it faithfully for six months, then developed a foul taste from the
narcissism apparent in so many other blogs and, in fact, in mine, and
canceled it. This new one is almost entirely poems, mostly of my own
writing, with a few graphics of such things as Lego steam engines, pop
stars, and sackbuts.

Aaron, I really enjoy your blog.

And I haven't met a single person who isn't narcissistic (me included). It's like being ashamed of breathing ...

Here's an invitation to peruse my much-belated entry in the blog marathon:

Truth be told, I was one of the very first people on the planet to have a
blog!  I set one up within a few months of the launch of Blogger.com, kept
it faithfully for six months, then developed a foul taste from the
narcissism apparent in so many other blogs and, in fact, in mine, and
canceled it. This new one is almost entirely poems, mostly of my own
writing, with a few graphics of such things as Lego steam engines, pop
stars, and sackbuts.

Flora, thanks.



Yeah, I sort of regret that caveat about having had a blog so many years ago
and canceling it.  It might appear vanity to veteran bloggers even to have
concerns such as that, or to share them.  Actually it's more accurate to say
that it has taken me this long to beat the learning curve re: new publishing
technology.  Although I have published poetry at meaningless.com for about
six years and other stuff at belz.net for longer than that, the blogolution
somehow eluded me.



Maybe in some sense it still eludes me.  I prefer online publishing at
places like Jacket, Salon, McSweeney's, No Tell Motel, etc. -- websites
whose contents pass editorial muster.  I know that my writing, even at its
best, is rarely ready for publication until other eyes are on it. I just
can't edit myself, and I'm willing to bet there are only a few writers who
can.  When I put poems online at meaningless.com it's often for the joy of
reading the handful of emails I receive in response to them.  I believe I've
gotten a better sense of my strengths and weaknesses by testing poetry at
meaningless.com, as I hope to at the new myspace blog.



The idea of posting open letters just doesn't intrigue me.  I'll say this;
I'm happy Ron Silliman is doing it. I'm happy for a handful of the blogs I
see.  But in general, the open call-and-response that happens on most blogs
strikes me as vague.  I think the older model of processing a piece through
an editor, a copyeditor, etc., and working within someone else's editorial
agenda, helps writers to focus what they're saying.  It also helps them to
take more time in saying it. It's more careful.



Hey, though- Mike Topp has a blog now.  The world is a better place.

I completely agree with you about the need for an editorial eye. I think for me the blog is useful simply because it compels me to write. Whether it's good or bad, it's the process toward an end product that hopefully is worthwhile. I hope you keep up the blogging, and I will keep reading!

Hi blogging comrades ---  I just got my blog going, though I'm still rather
weak-kneed in the techno dept.  I'd love to put my unpublished writings up,
but I know that many editors (including my self), consider writings on
public blogs "previously published."  So I'll be posting excerpts or
beginnings of new things.  I gather neither of you has similar concerns?

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

PRACTICAL CRITICISM: A POETRY WORKSHOP =E2=80=93 TONY TOWLE
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 14TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIt is assumed that participants will be serious, practicing poets and so
critiques and comments will be made from the vantage point of what the
person has already established, not with a view to =E2=80=98prescribing=E2=80=99 some
different way of writing. However, stretching the sensibility will be
encouraged, both in the group and through individual suggestion. Non-bindin=
g
assignments will be given each week and poems from the past as well as thos=
e
of the workshop participants will be read aloud and discussed. In the cours=
e
of this, numerous poets past and present, and topics both literary and
general, will arise and be talked about. Also I will make written comments
on poems individuals may prefer not to have read aloud.=E2=80=9D John Ashbery has
written: =E2=80=9CTony Towle is one of the best-kept secrets of the New York
School.=E2=80=9D Tony=E2=80=99s first reading at the Poetry Project was in 1968. Recent
books include The History of the Invitation: New & Selected Poems 1963-2000=
,
and Memoir 1960-1963.

THE UNPERFORMABLE: THE VISUAL SIDE OF POETRY =E2=80=93 EVELYN REILLY
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 16TH
=20
=E2=80=9CThe traditional notion of poetry as primarily a matter of =E2=80=9Cvoice=E2=80=9D ha=
s often
obscured its graphic and visual character, and can limit the range of
experiment to what can be experienced in the venue of the poetry reading.
Even the most performance-based poets, however, face issues of how to
spatialize their work on the page, and every line break is as much a visual
as a rhythmic and aural decision. This workshop will explore a broad range
of visual poetics =E2=80=94 from modernist innovations to composition-by-field to
recent spatialized text, concrete, collage, and digital poetry. We will
examine work by Mallarme, Apollinaire, cummings, Olson, Schwerner, Hak Kyun=
g
Cha, Aram Saroyan and Susan Howe, and peruse the UbuWeb site together.
Everyone will be encouraged to analyze the visual assumptions behind their
poems as well as to write or revise work using alternative visual
conventions.=E2=80=9D Evelyn Reilly=E2=80=99s book Hiatus was published by Barrow Stree=
t in

THURSDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 6

=E2=80=9CHow do we get the swirling-inside/outside-the-head onto the page? What a=
re
the differences between knowledge and information, and what are we putting
into our poems? Why? We will look at poets & projects confronting these
questions & we will explore our own potential in navigating transitional
space (community, jobs, war, media). We may look at poems by Etel Adnan,
Ammiel Alcalay, Jules Boykoff, Ernesto Cardinal, Roque Dalton, Kevin Davies=
,
Jeff Derksen, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Dana Gelinas, Fanny Howe, Susan
Howe, Pattie McCarthy, Yedda Morrison, Alice Notley, Mark Nowak, Douglas
Oliver, Kristin Prevallet, Deborah Richards, Cristina Rivera-Garza, Kaia
Sand, Leslie Scalapino, and Rodrigo Toscano. We will discuss how we read an=
d
what we value, how to assess the values of any given poem. We may address
contradictions in literal or figurative yogic practice and the
(in)corporate(zation) rush. How can we sustain simultaneously our health an=
d
our engagements with destruction?=E2=80=9D Carol Mirakove is the author of Mediat=

FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 17TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIn  this workshop, we will the explore the poetry and poetics of the New
York School of Poetry. A school of writing more linked by personal alliance=
s
and mutual dislikes, it features a dazzling range of approaches ranging fro=

the radical formalism of Edwin Denby to the the permanently =E2=80=9Cunder

(Eileen Myles) poets who are actually read by non-poets (Frank O=E2=80=99 Hara) a=
nd
poets held dear mostly by other New York School Poets (Joe Ceravolo, Steve

SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 18TH
=20
=E2=80=9CWe are making manuscripts of our work (at whatever stage the work or the
poet or both are). As poets we are also looking at and sometimes working
with prose, as another form of poetry, as well other forms of poetry such a=

"The best experimental theater troupe in town" -New York Magazine

No Great Society is a riveting neo-beat riff by Elevator Repair Service,
renowned for their reinvention of found objects and fragments of space and
time. In this world premiere, ERS veteran and enigmatic physical performer,
Susie Sokol conjures Jack Kerouac while sonic artist Ben Williams channels =
a
piano-pattering Steve Allen and prostrate William F. Buckley. A pair of
legendary interviews rip loose and spiral into a surreal and chaotic
exchange, soaked with liquor, jazz and philosophy.

Subject:      Sidebrow: Update & Call for Submissions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Sidebrow (www.sidebrow.net) — an online & print
journal dedicated to innovation & collaboration —
seeks fiction, poetry, art, essay, ephemera, found
text, & academia for its inaugural print publications,
as well as creative response to current posts and
ongoing projects.

As an online journal evolving toward print, Sidebrow
takes an open-ended approach to its construction,
periodically posting pieces as projects, builds, and
possibilities evolve. To stimulate participation in
communally constructed works, Sidebrow annotates
sample Fodder for Response for most posted pieces and
provides demi-weekly updates to its Pasteboard of
editors' notes.
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/fodder.php)
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/pasteboard.php)

Projects currently under way include:

B U I L D :   M O T H E R ,   I
Toward a multi-author, multi-genre novella (with seeds
sown by Bataille).
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/motheri.php)

T H E   L E T T E R S   P R O J E C T
Reviving the epistolary novella.
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/epistolary.php)

T H E   P A G E   2 4   P R O J E C T
A chapbook concerning and consisting exclusively of
page 24s.
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/page24.php)

L I T O P O L I S :   S A N   F R A N C I S C O
Staking a literary claim to the city.
(www.sidebrow.net/2006/litopolissf.php)

Other builds and projects based on current or future
postings are sure to follow.

Submissions to Sidebrow are evaluated both as
stand-alone set pieces & as points of departure for
establishing multi-author/multi-genre works. Given its
desire to unlock what is common to disparate literary,
artistic, & cultural pursuits, Sidebrow encourages the
submission of both partial excerpts and fully formed
works.

If you're in Pacific Standard Time, you can enjoy coffee and croissants while hearing poetry live over the internet.  If you're in any other time zone, you can do as you wish while you listen to the show:

  The Time:  10:30 a.m. PST
  The Place:  http://www.lighthouse-sf.org/

  (select AIS Audio from the main menu)

  The half hour show is also repeated, I believe, 8 hours later.  It will also be archived.

  I will be reading on the Poetry Scene program, hosted by Stephen Kopel.  Join us if you can.

Sidenote: damnit 3rdbed is gone now as well. Alas...

  I suppose this is a wide shotgun blast of a call, a request, an offer.
  There is an increasing number of successful literary magazines/journals moving
  towards offering content on the web. With that in mind it would seem some (or most) of those sites would ideal places to begin creating Electronic Lit sections. Hell, all it takes is grabbing an e-lit editor to look through a few works a month, and then loading and linking the work chosen.

  So.......I am willing to act as facilitator to any and all journals wanting to feature e-lit work on their sites.  Either I will do it myself, or I will connect you with others who can help you create an online gallery and begin looking for, accepting and featuring e-lit works.

  Again...please contact me either through back channel or this list and would be more than happy to help any journals (or find others to help) start an e-lit section on their sites.

  cheers, Jason Nelson

Working from memory here, Mark.  The last time I saw any of his work was
1978.  All I can recall was that it was slight, Creeleyesque but without
Creeley's shapely thought.

Hopkins is a strange institution in regards to poetry.  Sydney Lanier
actually held a chair in prosody there at a time when that kind of thing
didn't happen--particularly in an American University in the South.  Of
course there's the Stein connection as well.

I never met Mr Coleman, though I met I a few of the grads of that first
seminar, though apparently, from your posting, he was not universally
liked, he had a group of supporters, and these people set up the
Maryland Writers Council in an ancient town house next to the Unitarian
Church on Franklin street.  The palce was a wreck and was in fact
condemned.  I enjoyed hopping Clyde's bus and hanging out with these
people.  (I met B.P. Nichol there there one Sat. afternoon.)  The
director, a fellow named Dennis Boyles, gave me the key for the weekends
with the proviso that I keep the bums out.  So I had my own Baltimore
pad and slept on the top floor and when the bums tried to break in I'd
scare them off with some ghostly antics.

My time at Hopkins seems to have been quite different from yours, though
I probably had similar complaints about some of the lesser teachers.  We
didn't have many smart asses that I can recall, simply because we had
people like Hugh Kenner and John Barth to learn from.  Richard Howard is
a brilliant and generous man, though his work didn't do much for me
then and leaves me cold to this day--still his very presence and many
accomplishments commanded a certain repect in the classroom.  Cynthia
Macdonald was there.  I wonder if anyone on this list knows of her?  My
fellow students--and friends--included Louise Erdrich, Michael Martone,
and Lucie Brock Broido who was something of a post-modern prodigy.
There were others but they've faded from memory over the years.

Why don't you take a look at Lindley Williams Hubbell, Mark?  You might
like him better than any Coleman that I could cough up through hypnotic
regression.  Or perhaps you should try some hypnotic regression
yourself?  Perhaps a few of his poems are slyly encrypted in some
unsuspected node of gray or white matter?  Jesse

A puzzle for me--Robert Lax has always had more of a following in Europe
than in the U.S., though he's published by New Directions, etc.  Though
he's not as obscure as say, Lindley Williams Hubbell, he's still what
I'd call a Neglectorino.  Jess

Or... if blogs are public and therefore "published," then anything
posted is no longer "unpublished." So... post everything to the blog,
call it published, load the CV, and let the editors starve. The
"blogolution" will not be televised.

Coleman never showed us his poetry--do workshop leaders ever show
their poetry to the group?--and I don't think any of my classmates
had ever read him--we tended to share things, and no one offered. I
googled, but no luck. Barth and Kenner came a couple of years after I
was gone--the year I took the workshop was of course 1965, not 1966
as stated. No one that I know of disliked Coleman, including me--I
think most were fairly indifferent to him. He was a great relief,
tho, from the towering egos that dominated the humanities--Charles
Singleton, Earl Wasserman, Rene Girard, to name a few. The
undergraduate enrollment was pretty small, which meant that most
courses we took were a mixture of graduates and undergraduates--in
most schools undergraduates rarely meet the true megalos, not so at
Hopkins. A great education in a pressure-cooker, and it took a few
years to recover from. Each of the great divas were convinced that
his system for reading his subject was the only way, and tended to
enforce that. And we worked like dogs. In those days the
then-brand-new library closed at 9, but if you knocked at the door
the night watchman would let you in. Once in, you were locked in
until opening time. There were a lot of us working through the night.

By the time I left antiwar protest had escalated on campuses to the
point that there were very few where a govt official could speak
without nasty demonstrations. Hopkins, whose president was Ike's
brother and ex-CIA director Milton Eisenhower, was an
exception--Johnson himself spoke there, and there were only a dozen
or so protesters. I don't know whether this was a result of apathy,
or conservatism, or sheer exhaustion.

Did I mention that the undergraduate program was still all-male?
Didn't help the level of tension any. I was one of the few married
undergraduates.

Baltimore has since become a much more intersting place, and I go
there a couple of times a year to visit friends.

When did Anselm Hollo get to Balto? If he was there in 64-66 I wasn't
aware of it.

I just googled Hubbell--lots of info, no poems. Can you post an example or two?

Multimedia Fusions (Don Bergland -- bergland.com) will appear in the
Whatnots section of our next issue, and Don's working on a potentially
interactive multimedia exhibition.

So --- please contact me via my email address here.

Thanks.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Thirty days ago I announced that I was starting a project to mark my
40th birthday wherein I make a list of 365 people I'd met in my life,
whose first names I remembered, and who had impacted me in some way,
and/or had been interesting; then take that list and write 40 words a
day, one day for each of the names on the list, for a year. I also
challenged others to try it themselves.

Think about it for a moment. Do you know 365 people you could write
your age worth of words about? Maybe you do. Maybe you don't. In
either case the number is large enough that you can't be certain and
small enough that it should be easily provable one way or the other.

The process of making the list and condensing full personalities into
extremely limited space has turned out to be a rich and rewarding
experience on many levels, from the craft of writing to the spiritual
awareness of both individuality and interconnectedness.

I'm writing this, today, because I think it's worth mentioning that as
of this writing, 30 days into the project, there are 30 others from
around the world who have taken up the challenge and have started
posting their own versions of 40x365. Some have stuck very close to
the original template, some have varied it to suit. We have a 15 year
old, and a 66 year old. We have a person doing a haiku a day about a
person they've known, we have one posting appropriate images in
conjunction with their writing, we have one who has further structured
it to be 10 lines of 5 words each to accomplish her 50x365.

Instead of flash fiction, think of flash biographies. Character
studies. Snapshots of the essential. How much of an individual's
individuality can you convey in a number of words equal to your age?
There's only one way to find out.

I invite you all to visit and read the range of work being done.

I invite you all to join in and try this for yourself. You will not be
disappointed in the experience. You have my word.

Seriously? I've taught maybe a half dozen workshops at different
universities. Students invariably ask, and I tell them it's
inappropriate--that the course is about their work, not mine, but
they can always check the library if their curious.

Aside from ethical questions, the last thing one would want, I'd
think, is for the nature of one's own work to become a controversy in
the class--for some students the work would increase one's standing
as an authority, for some, inevitably, it would diminish it. In
either case, it would likely interfere with the task at hand.

But who you are -where you are coming from as a poet- makes a lot of difference on what and how you are teaching.

That bang-bang issue/argument

"Content Determines Form"

Versus

"Form Shapes Content"

Now maybe gets switched to,

"Content Determines Blog"

Versus

"Blog Determines Content."

If the last determination here is true, the baby is still learning to swim
in the sink! Which is to say, at least I find, the architecture of blog
space is still an ephemeral affair. Enormous amounts of language, pix and
sound - singularly or in multiples - occupying the monitor space, variously
performing as poems, critically talking, gossiping, formally experimenting,
etc. about them, or, on a simple level providing 'upcoming' information,
networking new, often long distance relationships. And it is quite amazing
that the Cyber gods can host all this stuff. (It's certainly the antithesis
state of going to Harvard circa 1923 with x small number of other boy poets,
publishing your poems in the Crimson - or whatever it was Review - and
launching an already - by virtue of education a career).
But to what degree is the blog world still primarily an incubatory
architecture for work that must ultimately stabilize and endure on (ideally)
acid free paper?
I was troubled recently, for example, in the discussion of Richard Long's
sculptural and text work, that those unfamiliar with it went to the Richard
Long web site and used the experience of the material presented there as a
means to make judgments about its value. Apart from its informational value,
the web site - even with the pictures - diminishes the value of the work
which is much more alive ('real') in books and on exhibit. In any case I did
not want to use the web site as a basis of an argument about Long's work. (I
guess we always get back to old Benjamin issues of aura, authenticity and
reproduction!)

My own sense is that a blog - in terms of what graphic designers call 'final
art' before going into design - remains an intermediary, exploratory state
that is remarkable as a cyber  playground. But just in the way basketball
players begin to establish their moves and skills on asphalt, it is no
substitute for 'making the team' - getting coached, refereed, and going one
on one a formal gym court in competition with your peers.

This latter process - in terms of the Net - seems to be best played out in
the best of Online magazines - where there is the opportunity for editorial
filters, quality graphic design, etc.

Which still begs the question of where work in the 21st century will most
endure. At bottom, are we still going to look at books, or, say, a good,
front edge magazine on paper, like "Poker" and trust it as a better
measure/pulse/ and tangible frame of what is most valuable. (I.e., that
online works - no matter production and editing value - are still ephemeral
-  including the fact that cyber "page view" time is inherently rapid, and
will never constitute a space for 'close reading.'

My suspicion is that - at least for poetry - that we are not about to leave
the cyber-tangible (printed on paper) partnership. In fact I believe we are
in a time now where (at least I am) split between whipping around on the
Internet - creating the work on my own blog and enjoying the exposure to the
work of others - while still craving the tangible (turning real pages back
and forth) and very much appreciating the books on my shelves.

But I don't know how a twenty something is relating to the new technology.
My daughter tells me that on her I-Pod she can listen to 67 days and 2 hours
straight of music and the new I-Pods will carry audio and text versions of
books, plus pictures and videos. Poetry must already be on board. So the
book and printed word may becoming an alien adventure or an adventure for
us new aliens!

I have to agree. My brief impression (teaching younger students -- 17-18
'gifted' types) is that the main reason students want to see your poetry
is to compare it to theirs to see how close they've gotten to the "right"
answer. Even if you try -- as I did -- to communicate how multifarious
poetry can be, it is hard for students to shake the idea.

And of course, it makes sense: in any other class, the teacher "knows" how
to write, e.g., a solid critical essay.

That said, if I was really good and if I had some distance on my work
(e.g., if it were something I wrote a decade or more ago), I could see
how it would be helpful, a kind of cheap way to bring a different poet
into the room.

My own feeling is that the forms of literary endevour amid the digital will
simply continue to proliferate and mutate. For instance, net art is now
entering the realm of the cellular phone. And, more generally, the network
is getting into all sorts of appliances and wearables and whatnots. That
will continue. And as it continues, artists will respond via the literary,
the visual, the sonic, the programmerly, etc. A computer is a machine that
can be any machine.

But books won't go away. Especially ones that aren't better experienced on a
monitor. Such as collections of poemy poems. And long prose works. Reference
material may more commonly be digital because reference material is better
searched (if not better browsed) in the digital. There are all sorts of
types of books that are better experienced in book form than on a monitor.

There are also all sorts of approaches to poetry and other literary art
forms that are better experienced on a monitor than in print. Such as
programmed work. Or a lot of visual poetry. And stuff involving audio. Or
video. Or discussion of literary matters (who does snail mail correspondence
anymore?).

My site is my 'book'. I have published no books. I don't dislike books. I
buy and read lots of them. But I am too busy making my site to put the work
I'd think was appropriate into a book. My site is my 'proof' that
significant and innovative literary work can take the form of a Web site.

I try to take advantage of what digital media has to offer poetry and poets.
And experience things other than the written word on a monitor, in the
digital, and see what that has to offer poetry and poets. And get into
visual art, audio art, video art, programmed art, and see how that can be
brought into relation with the literary. I think of the 'spirit of poetry'
wafting like smoke through digital media. Computers are language machines.

When we think of visual art, we can agree that it can happen in many
different media. When we think of poetry, still there is a tendency to think
of either words on a page or words spoken by a person. Over time, the idea
that poetry can happen in many media will make inroads into the culture. Of
course this has been ongoing for some time already.

I'm told that many of those odd quantum physicists now see matter as
behaving more like information than matter. As though the map really was the
territory. I have no idea. But certainly we are embarking on profound
understandings involving language and automata. Probably in our lifetimes we
will come to understand how the brain codes and stores information. That
will be a breakthrough in molecular biology on a par with the discovery of
DNA and Darwin's theory and will have profound implications for our
understanding of ourselves and the soft machine.

Language is crucial to computers and crucial to our own cognitive processes,
and to those of animals, also. There is an understanding of language on the
tip of our tongues that will change the world. Poetry must go there too.

Hi Mark,

I was at Hopkins 20 years after you, and of course Coleman wasn't ever brought up except in
various historical mentions (the spot where Dylan Thomas vomited had a much greater place in
program lore to us undergrads).  The campus was much more politically active, especially around
divestment from S. Africa and anti-star wars protests geared towards the applied physics
laboratory (aka "the death lab").  Poetry in the writing seminars was pretty much dominated by
conservatives and new formalists, Wyatt Prunty, Elizabeth Spires, Charles Martin, Peter Sacks
(well before he hooked up with Jorie Graham).  Fiction was much more open to experiment and play;
while the poetry side's discourse revolved around mastery and craft.

I think Hollo was affiliated with MICA in the late seventies, early eighties, part of a scene that
included Andrei Codrescu, Joe Carderelli, Tom DiVenti and the Apathy Press people.

Thanks for the updaye, Hugh.

While I was still living in California on a visit to Balto I went to
the Hopkins library. At the time I was teaching a course at UCSD,
where I imagine that the undergrads do lots of serious work, but with
as casual an appearance as possible--the library was never crowded,
and students seemed very relaxed. At Hopkins the library was jammed
with students who looked seriously anxious, sleep-deprived and
unwashed. You could smell the brain-sweat. Ah, home-sweet-home.

The poetics list's ridiculously tight limit on messages bounced back
my reply to the following:

>But who you are -where you are coming from as a poet- makes a lot of
>difference on what and how you are teaching.
>
>Murat

Of course my students know where I'm coming from. The workshops I've
taught always include a lot of assigned readings and discussions of
same, and I make it clear upfront that if they want to learn about
Elizabeth Bishop they'll have lots of teachers who can teach her work
with far more sympathy--the students get what wisdom I can offer. I
don't need them to be passionate about my work, and I'd guess that
many of them enjoy being treated as a captive audience as little as I do.

In scholarly fields (or in the case of anthologies) the assignment of
one's own work makes a lot more sense, tho I'm aware that one motive
for assigning them is to increase sales. Presumably one's books
present one's own synthesis of the field.

That said, I'm aware that most of the students I've taught lack all
but the most basic awareness of English language poetry before, say,
1910. The director of undergrad creative writing at one university
(OK, Arizona) told me that the kids have all read the full canon in
high school (nuff said), and that the U emphasized "the contemporary
voice," which happened not to include any of the poets I love. That's
about twelve years ago, and I hope things have changed. But I doubt
that the writing students are being encouraged to read a lot of
Jonson, Donne and Milton, or even Blake, to name a few. And the lack
isn't just in poetry. One very bright kid, asking me for a basic
reading list "of books I should have read in college,"  told me (this
was just before she graduated) that she'd never read Plato--she'd
actually been discouraged from doing so. And that was the tip of the iceberg.

Dear All,
I'm a relatively new member of the list and haven't posted yet, =20
though I've been greatly enjoying the conversation.  I wanted to join =20=

in on the discussion of the Hopkins Writing Seminars, having attended =20=

them in the mid-90s.  Hugh's description of his experience as an =20
undergrad there isn't dissimilar from my own as a graduate student =20
(except for the fact that I never heard Coleman's name mentioned at =20
all).   The department was informed mostly by traditional (though not =20=

really formalist at that point) writing.  I remember that our =20
workshop, after ploughing earnestly through Bishop, Gl=FCck, and =20
Heaney, collectively begged our teacher, Peter Sacks, to spend a =20
class on Ashbery, which--it should be added--he was happy to do.  I =20
had the vague feeling for most of the year that the poets I was =20
reading in reams were not the ones who would be most helpful to my =20
writing.  Then one professor suggested I go read Susan Howe.  Sitting =20=

in that library full of "brain-sweat," as Mark put it, struggling =20
through The Nonconformist's Memorial, was an experience from which I =20
hope never to recover.

Bruce Andrews took a course with Coleman as an undergraduate, I do believe.
But Bruce so far as I know never went through a period of conservative
writing that then later 'opened up' (as happened with a lot of the rest of
us in those years). I think his exposure to, knowledge of, all kinds of
music -- which was way ahead of anyone I knew in the 1960s -- led him to
feel much more comfortable with that level of freedom.

Nope, it was just Coleman and Macksey.

It isn't clear to me that quality graphic design can do much for poemy poems
on the Net.

A piece of work that is all textual simply needs to be made readable.
Introducing visual elements that deflect the focus of attention from the
text itself may do the text a disservice in making it less readable, though
visually interesting. There are many exceptions to this sort of observation.
I'm thinking mainly of poemy poems here, ie, poems in which the author
intended no visual or other media beyond the text itself.

Good graphic design, concerning purely textual works, consists in creating
an emminently readable text on a monitor. Establish focus on the text
itself. Perhaps by centering it horizontally and perhaps also vertically.
Don't make the font too small. The color of the text should contrast with
the background color significantly but not in a jarring manner. And, as
designer, get out of the text's way. Don't upstage it.

Visually attractive graphical design can confer status on texts. But it
rarely makes them emminently readable. If they aren't emminently readable,
they will not be read, though they may be admired.

I couldn't disagree more.  I think web design, page layout, graphic
sensibility contribute a lot to a considered reading of a "poemy
poem".. Not all that different than print publishing. My own pet
peeve is poetry ezines where the whole issue is one long long
scrolling page, no real separation between poems & if you're lucky
maybe there's an index with anchor tags on the top of the page.  I
find poorly designed & implemented ezines very frustrating to
navigate thru & really a contradiction to all the possibilities of
css & xhtml.  The exception to this are sites which are aesthetically
anti-design, txt based, or thoughtful in their resistence to
conventions.  With so many cms packages that are easily extensible
out of the box there is no reason not to create sites which are easy
to navigate & visually enticing.

Miekal, in terms of 'text centered' work, I believe what Jim says is
essentially true. That, a typography that draws attention to itself gets in
the way. That said, as you argue, a seamless, well executed design,
including choice of type, page lay out, etc. is a real skill (if not art) in
and of itself.


In terms of my attention blogs - compared to a well designed, well edited
web page - Blogs (including my own) are as haphazard as flea markets (which
I like, and are part of their charm). Links, photos, commentary, poems, etc.
variously colliding against each other - occasionally a great stretch of
photos, or a screed - and yet all the other stuff bouncing off the eye.
In no way is it 'finished art' - but, as I have suggested, an 'incubator', a
place to draw from, give birth to a formal work (poem, essay), appearance in
an ezine, ebook, or what have you.

And,yet, as Jim suggests, in his much longer post, the internet and these
virtual sites do become a manner of cyber thinking - a profile in and of
themselves of 'how we are'  - and, consequently, real important, preservable
graphs of the culture. In the history of this list, for example, I have
either participated in or watched, real important arguments and points of
view unfold that would not have so easily happened in print and other media.
On the other hand, I have not explored whether or not:
1. If, for example, the Buffalo listserv archive, has any kind of
sophisticated search mechanism that would go within 'posts' - or if it's
limited to searching thread 'subject' lines. Or, if Charles B. & Company
have any plans to catalog and organize the posts into folders, and more
keyword and line search accessible. (??).
2. I further don't know if folks are using material on the list for any kind
of academic, etc. research. I suspect yes. Is it hugely cumbersome?


My original question - I believe - was on the question durability. How is
the cyber world ever going to be appropriately and in what manner archived.
The technology and its platforms are so liquid that say, in 20 years,
looking for a web based magazine of 2004 is, I suspect, going to be real
complex or impossible (unless somebody keeps migrating the mag from one
platform to another, etc.) And I suspect, given money and time issues in the
poetry world, that will be highly unlikely. (O well, one cynically thinks,
the Poetry Foundation already has a program in place for this(?) - but which
works will they choose to put in the cyber poetry archive library vault for
ezine, ebook, blog, website?

Maybe it's a good idea to get out those Number 2 pencils and write out our
collected works on acid free paper and keep them in a fire proof vault.

On the other hand, the 'preservation of memory' as we have come to know it
in the West, might becoming 'history.'  As Jim seems to suggest, the way the
new technology is stretching the instrumentation of thinking and interfacing
with the world (within an entirely new 'soft' architecture), the nature of
memory and how we preserve it (durability) may be totally redefined. Jim
Andrews - to his credit - seems to very involved in imagining and enjoying
the prospects there and its interesting to hear his 'grip' on it.

Well, sorry, I have wandered a bit here. Thanks for your patience.

Edward R. Tufte's work, The Visual Display of Quantitative Data; =
Graphics Press, Cheshire, CT 1983 =A9 Edward Tufte, does a remarkable =
job of demonstrating the importance of presentation of information.  =
While it is true that professor Tufte's work was designed more toward an =
engineering perspective of displaying data, one need only study the =
material to see the relevance of the thought as it applies to the arts =
in general.  From Balanchine's work presenting dancers to Warhol's =
materials in paint,to Zukofsky's A, poem, presentation plays a critical =
role in the artistic processes. =20

Poetry is just another form of presenting information, and IMHO, layout =
and typography play a critical role in presenting the poem to the =
reader. That point appears relevant to me whether the work appears on a =
blog or on a page within a printed magazine or an expensive hand-bound =
volume. =20

from SOME PERSPECTIVES Poetry is just another form of presenting informati=
on

but that doesn't mean that reading a poem is like reading a balance sheet
or a stock report

the *way of meaning that a poem develops is quite unlike the way of meanin=
g
of most other informational communication

If layout and typography of a poem are not PART OF the poem then their use=

- and they must be used - is going to be of a different order

Actually Stephen, I think that part of the success of the blog format=20

pre-designed blog page. Rather than being "as haphazard as flea=20

other than in the obvious efficient transmission of information.

What you mention (no real separation between poems) makes the individual
poems less readable.

So does having too many of them in a publication, regardless of the quality
of the layout and design. The poems become insignificant subjects of the
publisher.

If you want somebody to read something, you have to indicate that you want
them to read it both in what leads up to their encounter with the work (so
they get there at all) and the presentation of the work itself. These are
matters of visual rhetoric.

'Good design' concerning the presentation of poemy poems is not so much
'visually attractive' as it places focus on the text or texts, makes them
readable, and is aware of its own unspoken rhetoric of establishing focus
and concentration.

I'm not quite sure what you're disagreeing with that you couldn't disagree
with more.

Are you ready, are your children ready or, Jeesus - it's here!

US group implants electronic tags in workers
By Richard Waters in San Francisco
Published: February 12 2006 22:02 | Last updated: February 12 2006 22:02
An Ohio company has embedded silicon chips in two of its employees - the
first known case in which US workers have been =B3tagged=B2 electronically as a
way of identifying them.

CityWatcher.com, a private video surveillance company, said it was testing
the technology as a way of controlling access to a room where it holds
security video footage for government agencies and the police.

*

Amazing, and the company calls itself, "City Watcher" - a superficially
benign self-definition, if there ever was one. I am actually thinking of
those people who wake up - after an evening drink of a special sort in a
distant City - and find themselves missing a kidney. Chip implants or their
removal will be the next phase of that kind of surgical practice. Or spare
the surgery, and may the hackers on the left unite and bring down those
chips. Certainly, parents are going to be demanding devices to insure their
children are not carrying government implants - or, conversely, there will
be those parents looking to give their children implants, along with the V
chips in their home computer systems. But workers at any job potentially
required to submit to this?

Ain't we humans all so lovely. Or as Rumsfeld says, "Goodness gracious."

Or, imagining Cheney, after firing his gun into a fellow hunter's face, "I
want to assure my fellow Americans this incident is not a metaphor for the
way I normally operate."

What's a lyric poem - or any poem - supposed to do with all this??

Here's a weird request: this performance space here in Brooklyn is doing a "Drunken Poets" benefit where people are going to read work by famous soused poets, i.e. Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, Sexton, Edna St. Vincent Millay, etc.  They're trying to find more women in that category.  Any suggestions?  Either gender, really, but they want to make sure women poets are amply represented in pickled mix.  Please backchannel.  Thanks, betsy.

Dear All-

  I'm writing to announce that the new issue of GutCult is up, and it  would mean a lot to me and the authors if you would take a look.
  http://www.gutcult.com

  The overall look of the site has changed a little, and this may well be  the last issue based on zones of the calendar.  In the future,  look for a more open-ended set of "thematically"-based issues.

  The current issue contains work by:

  Donald Revell
  Isaac Sullivan
  Catherine Theis
  Janet Holmes
  Jared Stanley
  Kent Johnson
  Brandon Shimoda (a review of Stan Apps' Soft Hands)
  Kathleen Peterson
  Robert Strong
  Lauren Levin
  Broc Rossell
  Jim Goar
  Martin Corless-Smith
  Nathan Parker
  John Mercuri Dooley
  Randall Williams (a review of Anna Eyre's Metaplastic)

  Many of these poets may be new to you (I hope so).  I think you  will find something to like in this issue.  I think it's really  good.

  Best-

  Aaron

Subject:      Bruce Andrews In None of the Above, Richard Hugo, et. al.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Yes, I recall Bruce Andrews' work from that time as represented in
Michael Lally's None of the Above, which took the form of a
performative text--rather Cage-like, I thought when I read it.

When I left Hopkins I scrawled "Artaud Died for Your Sins, JHU!" in the
official Writing Seminars john.  I wonder if any of you 90's fellows
noticed it?  I'm sure it's been framed and put under glass.

Yes, Elizabeth Spires was in my class as well.  She was an earnest young
woman.  She couldn't understand why I liked the opening poem of Hart
Crane's "The Bridge" better than "My Grandmother's Love Letters."
I still love "For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen" the best.  Beth
Joselow drifted through as well as Daniel Mark Epstein--a guy I recall
from a few years earlier--1976--writing poems about the Civil War and
wanting to be a boxer.

It's strange to look out of my window on a late afternoon in Japan and
write about the Baltimore of so many years ago.

More names:  Ed Cox, and a native-American writer who did some
interesting work by the name of Drum.

Speaking of poets however, what about those who were lionized and whose
stars have fallen well below zero?  I have to admit that I used to read
The American Poetry Review back in the days of Jim Wright and Richard
Hugo and now I find both of them dated.  I picked up Hugo's collected
and I just can't see what the fuss was all about now that all the bells
and whistles have stopped.  Wright, of course, in his "leaping poetry"
days was either right on or just plain silly--those kinds of images
either work or they don't.  But Hugo??? The language at its best is
like a pale echo of Roethke (whom I love ), and at its worst seems
spavined and self-pitying and verbose.  He unerringly picks the worst
five cent words to stick at the crucial places in a poem.  Just
yesterday I almost threw the book against the wall when Hugo
congratulates himself and a chum in one of his "letter poems" about
how both of them became directors of big writing programs!  Well, who
would have thunk it!!!  Of course, this was the time when writing
programs were springing up all over the U.S. as a way of bringing in
more students.  It was big business in the U.S. of A.  I guess it still
is.  And there's Richard Hugo telling his fellow big poet about how he
likes to fish, feel lonely, and head a department in Montana.  Give that
man an official Po-Biz cigar!  Someone said that all the big poets and
their epigones wrote "stone" poems way back in ye olde seventies, and
by god there's a whole section of Hugo's stone poems just lined up and
waiting to be hefted!

I'm sure there are those out there who love Hugo--or knew him--and
that's fine.  Maybe these near-blind eyes are missing something.  But
take O'Hara's language and stack it up against Hugo's tired,
repetitive stuff, and there's simply no comparison.

There's another "letter poem" from Hugo to Gary Snyder in which he
tells Snyder how much he's missed among the students in Montana and
honest to dixie--at least in terms of language--I can see why.    Jess

As many of you know, Michael Rothenberg has spent much of the past year
soliciting poets for his Blue Poets in Red States project.  He contacted
approximately seventy poets from Red states who wanted to incorporate their
views into a collaborative poem that reflects their thoughts and concerns
about the State of this country after the 2004 election. Michael emailed the
poem to one poet, who added their poetry and returned it to him, then he
forwarded it to the next poet, until everyone had contributed to the poem.
The poets were free to place their lines at the beginning, middle or end,
allowing them to create a random work addressing specific concerns while
generating a collective energy.

The Blue Poets in Red States collaboration is a statement filled with many
moods and attitudes, some of them far different from the expected, flowing
in a manner as fluid and disjunctive as a cry of unity from diverse voices.

The work is interesting, and sometimes startling.  I suggest you check it
out at

Dear Ray,

Just returned to Beijing, and this is my back channel.
Might not be reasonable to be explicit via e-mail,
given my location. Sounds a bit, you know, but is the
real situation. In March, I'll be returning Stateside
for some readings, then back here -- the end of spring
it'll be back to whence I've just come. Your
suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards,
Alex

and between us we share
one fit of laughter
at the spectators=92 confusion
as we sail beyond
either/or
and neither.

US: The End of the Internet

=20

by Jeffrey Chester, The Nation

February 6th, 2006

=20

http://corpwatch.org/article.php?id=3D13245

=20

=20

The nation's largest telephone and cable companies are crafting an alarming
set of strategies that would transform the free, open and nondiscriminatory
Internet of today to a privately run and branded service that would charge =
a
fee for virtually everything we do online.

=20

Verizon, Comcast, Bell South and other communications giants are developing
strategies that would track and store information on our every move in
cyberspace in a vast data-collection and marketing system, the scope of
which could rival the National Security Agency.

=20

According to white papers now being circulated in the cable, telephone and
telecommunications industries, those with the deepest pockets --
corporations, special-interest groups and major advertisers -- would get
preferred treatment. Content from these providers would have first priority
on our computer and television screens, while information seen as
undesirable, such as peer-to-peer communications, could be relegated to a
slow lane or simply shut out.

=20

Under the plans they are considering, all of us -- from content providers t=
o
individual users -- would pay more to surf online, stream videos or even
send e-mail. Industry planners are mulling new subscription plans that woul=
d
further limit the online experience, establishing "platinum," "gold" and
"silver" levels of Internet access that would set limits on the number of
downloads, media streams or even e-mail messages that could be sent or
received.

=20

To make this pay-to-play vision a reality, phone and cable lobbyists are no=
w
engaged in a political campaign to further weaken the nation's
communications policy laws. They want the federal government to permit them
to operate Internet and other digital communications services as private
networks, free of policy safeguards or governmental oversight. Indeed, both
the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are considerin=
g
proposals that will have far-reaching impact on the Internet's future. Ten
years after passage of the ill-advised Telecommunications Act of 1996,
telephone and cable companies are using the same political snake oil to
convince compromised or clueless lawmakers to subvert the Internet into a
turbo-charged digital retail machine.

=20

The telephone industry has been somewhat more candid than the cable industr=
y
about its strategy for the Internet's future. Senior phone executives have
publicly discussed plans to begin imposing a new scheme for the delivery of
Internet content, especially from major Internet content companies. As Ed
Whitacre, chairman and CEO of AT&T, told Business Week in November, "Why
should they be allowed to use my pipes? The Internet can't be free in that
sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment, and for =
a
Google or Yahoo! or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes [for]
free is nuts!"

=20

The phone industry has marshaled its political allies to help win the
freedom to impose this new broadband business model. At a recent conference
held by the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a think tank funded by Comcast=
,
Verizon, AT&T and other media companies, there was much discussion of a pla=
n
for phone companies to impose fees on a sliding scale, charging content
providers different levels of service. "Price discrimination," noted PFF's
resident media expert Adam Thierer, "drives the market-based capitalist
economy."

=20

Net Neutrality

=20

To ward off the prospect of virtual toll booths on the information highway,
some new media companies and public-interest groups are calling for new
federal policies requiring "network neutrality" on the Internet. Common
Cause, Amazon, Google, Free Press, Media Access Project and Consumers Union=
,
among others, have proposed that broadband providers would be prohibited
from discriminating against all forms of digital content. For example, phon=
e
or cable companies would not be allowed to slow down competing or
undesirable content.

=20

Without proactive intervention, the values and issues that we care about --
civil rights, economic justice, the environment and fair elections -- will
be further threatened by this push for corporate control. Imagine how the
next presidential election would unfold if major political advertisers coul=
d
make strategic payments to Comcast so that ads from Democratic and
Republican candidates were more visible and user-friendly than ads of
third-party candidates with less funds.

=20

Consider what would happen if an online advertisement promoting nuclear
power prominently popped up on a cable broadband page, while a competing
message from an environmental group was relegated to the margins. It is
possible that all forms of civic and noncommercial online programming would
be pushed to the end of a commercial digital queue.

=20

But such "neutrality" safeguards are inadequate to address more fundamental
changes the Bells and cable monopolies are seeking in their quest to
monetize the Internet. If we permit the Internet to become a medium designe=
d
primarily to serve the interests of marketing and personal consumption,
rather than global civic-related communications, we will face the political
consequences for decades to come. Unless we push back, the "brandwashing" o=
f
America will permeate not only our information infrastructure but global
society and culture as well.

=20

Why are the Bells and cable companies aggressively advancing such plans?
With the arrival of the long-awaited "convergence" of communications, our
media system is undergoing a major transformation. Telephone and cable
giants envision a potential lucrative "triple play," as they impose
near-monopoly control over the residential broadband services that send
video, voice and data communications flowing into our televisions, home
computers, cell phones and iPods. All of these many billions of bits will b=
e
delivered over the telephone and cable lines.

=20

Video programming is of foremost interest to both the phone and cable
companies. The telephone industry, like its cable rival, is now in the TV
and media business, offering customers television channels, on-demand video=
s
and games. Online advertising is increasingly integrating multimedia (such
as animation and full-motion video) in its pitches. Since video-driven
material requires a great deal of Internet bandwidth as it travels online,
phone and cable companies want to make sure their television "applications"
receive preferential treatment on the networks they operate. And their
overall influence over the stream of information coming into your home (or
mobile device) gives them the leverage to determine how the broadband
business evolves.

=20

Mining Your Data

=20

At the core of the new power held by phone and cable companies are tools
delivering what is known as "deep packet inspection." With these tools, AT&=
T
and others can readily know the packets of information you are receiving
online -- from e-mail, to websites, to sharing of music, video and software
downloads.

=20

These "deep packet inspection" technologies are partly designed to make sur=
e
that the Internet pipeline doesn't become so congested it chokes off the
delivery of timely communications. Such products have already been sold to
universities and large businesses that want to more economically manage
their Internet services. They are also being used to limit some peer-to-pee=
r
downloading, especially for music.

=20

But these tools are also being promoted as ways that companies, such as
Comcast and Bell South, can simply grab greater control over the Internet.
For example, in a series of recent white papers, Internet technology giant
Cisco urges these companies to "meter individual subscriber usage by
application," as individuals' online travels are "tracked" and "integrated
with billing systems." Such tracking and billing is made possible because
they will know "the identity and profile of the individual subscriber,"
"what the subscriber is doing" and "where the subscriber resides."

=20

Will Google, Amazon and the other companies successfully fight the plans of
the Bells and cable companies? Ultimately, they are likely to cut a deal
because they, too, are interested in monetizing our online activities. Afte=
r
all, as Cisco notes, content companies and network providers will need to
"cooperate with each other to leverage their value proposition." They will
be drawn by the ability of cable and phone companies to track "content
usage...by subscriber," and where their online services can be "protected
from piracy, metered, and appropriately valued."

=20

Our Digital Destiny

=20

It was former FCC chairman Michael Powell, with the support of
then-commissioner and current chair Kevin Martin, who permitted phone and
cable giants to have greater control over broadband. Powell and his GOP
majority eliminated longstanding regulatory safeguards requiring phone
companies to operate as nondiscriminatory networks (technically known as
"common carriers"). He refused to require that cable companies, when
providing Internet access, also operate in a similar nondiscriminatory
manner. As Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig has long noted=
,
it is government regulation of the phone lines that helped make the Interne=
t
today's vibrant, diverse and democratic medium.

=20

But now, the phone companies are lobbying Washington to kill off what's lef=
t
of "common carrier" policy. They wish to operate their Internet services as
fully "private" networks. Phone and cable companies claim that the
government shouldn't play a role in broadband regulation: Instead of the
free and open network that offers equal access to all, they want to reduce
the Internet to a series of business decisions between consumers and
providers.

=20

Besides their business interests, telephone and cable companies also have a
larger political agenda. Both industries oppose giving local communities th=
e
right to create their own local Internet wireless or wi-fi networks. They
also want to eliminate the last vestige of local oversight from electronic
media -- the ability of city or county government, for example, to require
telecommunications companies to serve the public interest with, for example=
,
public-access TV channels. The Bells also want to further reduce the abilit=
y
of the FCC to oversee communications policy. They hope that both the FCC an=
d
Congress -- via a new Communications Act -- will back these proposals.

=20

The future of the online media in the United States will ultimately depend
on whether the Bells and cable companies are allowed to determine the
country's "digital destiny." So before there are any policy decisions, a
national debate should begin about how the Internet should serve the public=
.
We must insure that phone and cable companies operate their Internet
services in the public interest -- as stewards for a vital medium for free
expression.

=20

If Americans are to succeed in designing an equitable digital destiny for
themselves, they must mount an intensive opposition similar to the
successful challenges to the FCC's media ownership rules in 2003. Without
such a public outcry to rein in the GOP's corporate-driven agenda, it is
likely that even many of the Democrats who rallied against further
consolidation will be "tamed" by the well-funded lobbying campaigns of the
powerful phone and cable industry.

Dear Ray,

Just returned to Beijing, and this is my back channel.
Might not be reasonable to be explicit via e-mail, given my location. Sounds
a bit, you know, but is the real situation. In March, I'll be returning
Stateside for some readings, then back here -- the end of spring it'll be
back to whence I've just come. Your suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards,
Alex

Hello Ron, I'm replying to your blog entry about Mayakovsky here because my machine, for some reason wouldn't allow me to comment in the more appropriate space.  I was glad to see mention of Arkadi Dragomoshenko's Chinese Sun, which I've recently read in the Ugly Duckling Presse translation and recommend to anyone.  Are there any good or interesting reviews out there of this book?  I haven't heard of any.  Although I read the book thoroughly, I would appreciate reading thoughts it occasioned in other people's brains.

But Bruce so far as I know never went through a period of conservative
writing that then later 'opened up' (as happened with a lot of the rest of
us in those years). I think his exposure to, knowledge of, all kinds of
music -- which was way ahead of anyone I knew in the 1960s -- led him to
feel much more comfortable with that level of freedom.

Bruce Boone

Who has some lovely, real good poems in Keven Killian's current,
Mirage #4/ Period(ical) #127.  A fellow San Fransican, Bruce is one of the
smartest cookies on the block and a wonderful writer. Maybe his books -
published by Black Star in the 80's - are still in print(check with SPD).
He's been way too quiet for too long. Bruce's work is like the invisible
shadow of a combination of his good friends, Bob Gluck and Beverly Dahlen!



I forget if these attentions are to go direct to CA Conrad (?) for his
project. Or, Conrad are you picking up from this list?

Fellowship and a 2003 British Centre for Literary
Translation Residential Bursary. Some of Stephens's
work has been translated into Basque, Bulgarian, and
Slovene. She has translated Catherine Mavrikakis and
François Turcot into English and Gail Scott and R. M.
Vaughan into French. On occasion, she translates
herself. She lives between.  Stephens has new work
forthcoming this year from Coach House (Touch to
affliction) and Book Thug (a self translation of Je
Nathanaël).

JEFF MARLIN is an artist and graphic designer
currently living in Chicago. A prolific painter, his
work explores the relationship between the body and
the machine through various forms of translation that
involve human interference. Most recently, his artwork

Editions, No Press and LVNG magazine, and is
forthcoming for Canada's avant-garde press, Coach
House Books.

LISE BEAUDRY's photographic work has been exhibited in
several Canadian cities, the U.S., Romania, and France
during Les Rencontres Internationales de la
Photographie. In 2002, her first video: Le Tourbillon
won her the Best Upcoming Toronto Video/Film make at
the Inside Out Film Festival as well as the Audience
Award at the Dublin Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. This
short has now toured to 26 festivals in Canada, the
U.S. and Europe. In 2003, she co-founded
Alleyjaunt--local art in local garages--a Toronto
alternative annual art event transforming the back
alley garages surrounding Trinity Bellwoods Park into
venues that showcase visual art, installations,
performance, film and video.

stories, Passion, appeared in 2005 with Talisman
Publishers.

BENNY NEMEROFSKY is a Montréal-born artist working
predominantly in video, text and sound. Since 2000 his
work has brought together song, self-reflexive
performance and lyrics from pop music as vehicles for
examining the singing voice, the untranslatability of
emotions into language and the ways in which emotional
expression changes shape when mediated by technology
and popular culture.  Nemerofsky Ramsay's work has
screened in festivals and galleries across Canada,
Europe and East Asia and has won prizes at the Hamburg
Short Film Festival, the Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und
Videofest and the Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen (all in

Notes from New Palestine: Beefin’ the blues only
(a prayer for chris buck)


…and all your two bit friends …they talking behind your back saying –
man, you ain’t never gonna be no humanbeing
lou reed

i'm callin out
to all my thugs in the ghetto (callin out)
cause it gets hard sometimes
but ya gotta keep ya head up, and be strong
trick daddy

Music don’t begin like a song,” he said. “Forget all that bullshit you
hear. Music can get to be a song, but starts with a cry. That’s all. It
might be the cry of a newborn baby,...or a man when they put the knife
to his balls. And the sound is everywhere. People spend there whole
lives trying to drown out that sound.
James Baldwin




brr

In order to come to consciousness and clearity as to what caused a boy
in the south shore, trapped in a tattooed room, to come to find life in
a group of westcoast punkers turning amerikkkanada upside down with a
battlecry of hardcore, I had to step back and travel to a land inwhich
louis armstrong and patti smith took me to – one of the dead boys doing
all the latest dances and twitches -- of boards and beat up rides
transporting everyman egoes to shows with new hopes for a underground
society – one of white and black boys who were hell bent on wanting to
sing the westend blues.

It was the metaphysical blues -- a poor folk struggle made clear as I
read that james baldwin called music a cry at birth. it’s a hollering in
pubs over your fathers death in you or at the authorities who whip our
backs raw or just that you can’t make that girl. I was listening to
cream and blind faith on repeat. It’s what got me feeling kind of half
baked and kinda ginger about the situation I had come to -- to make it
all clear on how we got here -- it was about jam numbers for one thing.
…and all and all, and all that will became of it, was a call to us after
all. X heard that call and transformed a writing class romance into punk
a billy holla by rearranging howling wolf. Then lee ving, with fear
surrounding him, put the soul back into boloney, of all things, and
slayer gave us warning in “angel of death” and the norwegians heard that
viking blues which finally summoned their entry into the world of post
industrial individualism and new global frustration.

This was the decry of western culture. I heard it had to be true. It
came from richard hell and then the ramones mashed brian wilson’s
teenage symphony to god and penelope spheeris filmed the bruhs giving
voice to it as some have passed on, one by one, in midskank. I came to
reality’s unreality while sitting in my buddy marco’s basement as a kid
listening to ufo II then letting hawkwind chant how much I shouldn’t do
whatever it was I thinking on , that it was a direct action plan of pure
thought made into a sonic performance piece of situationist’s hardcore
hootenanny calamity boogie.

…and all the dudes and dudettes heard that cry and all the crowd
assembled in rooms basements and floors, beyond colour to become human,
to become what some would call lil rotters on the road to ruin in cause
of rebellion.

Back in livingrooms and tattooed rooms, I guess it can even inspire loco
black men with electronics armed with the giver’s sound, like a couple
of norwegians in a house thashing about with recording equipment in
accustisc space, making metal immediate and low fi, like the gentlemen
of 1/2 japanese did to make real this dream of reel to reel tragedy like
royal trux did, hoping it might chill his madness – and all you needed
was a macluhan space, acetate and the love of murdering the vibration
with magnets and resin.

However, as did the blues, punk can be made into audio literature what
was taught to me by the dialogue of the l.a. wordcore recordings like
“Neighborhood Rhythms” or “English As A Second Language” -- this is
where henry rollins had something to say and hadn’t become a poster boy
for tattooed quasi homosexuals from the suburbs -- where exene cervenka
showed and proved her staying power as not just the chick at the mic.
This is where john doe spoke like he sang; where dave alvin collected
the thoughts and held the beat of the whole scene with words just like
the blasters echoed the rock a billy steady in the back bone of the l.a
punk scene. so we must never forget the blues like john doe always knew
and so did chris buck too -- the blues was out to express a cry in a
pretty lo fi yet effective dub. All songs start with a cry like the
change up in darkthrone’s “fucked up and ready to die”.

Now, fenriz, of darkthrone, tells us, black metal has this individual
thing going on so it ain’t like punk. people have confused punk rock
with a collectivist movement theorim which is a lefty propaganda
scheme/a right wing recruitment tool -- the whole sublime inter-motion
surrenders to dogma for the booshwash looking to organize something into
cataloges of behaviourial mundanity. It was more about david
wojnarowicz’s advice on how to use a camera – first throw away the
instructinos then start taking pictures. The fact of the material was
that the u.k., unlike europe, had made the music, like they had the
peasant art of opera, into a philosophy for the booshwashes – while the
north side of the planet made it about doing, about action, about living
with pure thought made loud in sonic disarrangement.

I saw a documentary air on norwegian tv on black metal where a a bloke
and fenriz describes the music as a feeling of intense pain – a feeling
and pain – blues to hard core or punk rock sensibility is what has made
them last and endure. All genres must be not played or performed but
lived and felt straight into your gut and many have died living the life
or, as rock n roll likes to call it, keepin the faith.

So when I get to the point of no activity, too much philosophy and
fucked up by some aspects of black metal and facism or punk and what
kind of studs you’re rockin on your jacket or whether you have baught
into the broken rifle or snapped sticks of anarchy patches to the
imposition of feminist doctine and gay pop culture making people less
than human, -- i think of fear in decline of western civiliazation part
1 rapping (chatting with clearity and style):
dave alvin,
genet
a dennis cooper prior to the cool of porn and the internet,
an african landing,
patti smith’s version of rimbaud,
some angry samoans doing call and responses on “lights out” or laying
down the law in “homo- sexal”;
to do whatever, do what it takes, fuck the fakes but never be a 3 letter
man. Maybe, then I can overstand now, what I understood then, what
caused the bad brains to say what they said about san francisco in the 80’s.

i just wanted to transform my madness like jaxson did and make tracks
like mott the hoople in “Honaloochie Boogie”, compose writs with pacific
frontal system, jump in on a chorus with sonic youth or flex a rhyme
with patti smith -- maybe be lucky and find a girl like exene. B.u.t. in
this country of catagories --being black and proud and liking music loud
-- due to the “intergrate or isolate” policy -- I was made invisible and
a bit ridiculous for not finding a label to die in. In punk/hardcore I
was just a mug like any other mug, therefore; a man – a dude like all
the young bucks thrashing like likkle rotters and tumbling into gutters
lost in a permamant angel lust, like all the suckers. Mathematically, it
said that if the white boy had the right to sing to blues then I had the
right to keep the beat in words on pages over explosions in my
livingroom space caught on the digital 7.

Everybody needs a space -- be it in a tattooed room in the south shore
or dropping bum tracks in a basement bunker on the westcoast – you can
dictate to a heart so much and then it’ll summon a cry that will be the
blues for a next movement.

 From Ramones to Satanic slaughter from celtic frost to allfather the
blues like punk was never meant to remain in the same chord -- chris
buck knew that. If so, it would be nostalgia like british skinhead
culture, the teddy boy and those lost in an allman brothers’
melancholia. It was meant to show and prove a forward flow in a mental
state. Metal had to progess too. It became classical music – wagner
propelled through marshall amps at full throttle then sent back to
basements to be replicated and adored back into the world of black metal
lo fi. So must punk rock then and mr buck knew that too.

This was the decline of western sociopathy – that your resistence can be
invoked by having too much just as it can be from havng too little to
nothing – so penelope said in “the new york rocker”. She said too, in
“suburbia”, of the neglect of care of kids born in wealth to the benign
neglect of poverty by the system – it was not a pop planet call to
embrace the suburbs, government policies and white wash the massive
depression behind brian wilson harmonies and arrangements.

Hearing this, I became the spooky dude who at by the door and thrashed
on the floor of the pit watching the gun club’s bad indians ‘do their
war dance’. Those were the bruhs who would rather crash than burn out –
it was then –
clearity
clearity
clearity
it was then
I realized that the 3 letter men fear went on about never thought that
jeffery dahmer was evil for what he did b.u.t. christopher scarver and
slayer did – so who gets the big up in my fiction or dubbed reality?
clearity
clearity -- it was then
that I had learned that punk wasn’t a form of music but a state of mind
– metal, like rock a billy, was the way of life – it was a live and
die/kiss or kill kind of steez – one to do right by it blues – are you
ready teddy? I only play football for the coach too, louie - in this
revolutionary suicide called hard core; crying the westend new
palestinian fucked up blues – come pause with me in mid air.

all praise be

Amy--

  This is going to sound really wierd (go ahead & correct me Dave, I choose to spell this way) but the last time I mailed something to Jacques Debrot it was returned with a post office stamp that said "Deceased" which was boldly stamped in red. If you find out otherwise let me know.

  Also, I think you would really like the winner of the book award this year, Rachel Simon, Although you write vastly differently there is something comparable. One of these days I will publish it, for now I am sending out my own poems.

  I had no idea how easy it is to be published these days. Holy Cow! Maybe I should create a machine to start writing crappy poems. I would call this machine Andrew Topel.

  from your publisher before he sold out of your first chapbook





Be well

"If you want to taste the Beat Poets and sample the writers who followed
them, *Baby Beat Generation & The 2nd San Francisco Renaissance* is about a=
s
good as it will get. The work in this collection is of high quality. I'm no=
t
sure why this surprised me. I have read many anthologies and usually come
away with a 50% sense of satisfaction, but not this time so I asked Thomas
Rain Crowe whose work is featured in the collection and whose preface helpe=
d
to established historic context. He told me, "Looking back, now I think the
poetry that came out of the 2nd San Francisco renaissance is still some of
the best, and most interesting, poetry of the last thirty years. These were
talented, dedicated, and extremely literate poets, some of whom were 'well
educated', but all of whom were very well read and had been writing for
quite a long time, even though many of us were only in our mid-late
twenties. This was a very diverse group of poets, who wrote in uniquely
different styles from one another and from their beat friends and mentors."
The book includes poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, Jack
Micheline, Jack Hirschman, Harold Norse, Diane Di Prima, Nanos Valaoritis,
Michael McClure, Bob Kaufman and David Meltzer on the beat side, and poetry
by Thomas Rain Crowe, Ken Wainio, Neeli Cherkovski, David Moe, Janice Blue,
Paul Wear, Luck Breit, Kaye McDonough, Philip Daughtry, Kristen Wetterhahn,
Jerry Estrin, and Roderick Iverson, as well as pictures and an attached CD
which includes readings by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Diane Di Prima, Bob
Kaufman, Jack Hirschman, Jack Micheline, Thomas Rain Crowe, Michael
Lorraine, Cole Swenson and Ken Wainio."


Charles P. Ries's probing and engaging review of this anthology, followed b=
y
elicited remarks by Kaye McDonough concerning the dearth of women poets of
that era and place, may be found in Mad Hatters' Review:

I wonder, one wonders, among the shit smelled so well,
if it's time for the poets to stand up and remark in
ways that'll make a difference -- bold, brave, and
with indifference to all those pols whose chosen this
trade "'cause it's part of their fashion sense" -- or
'cause they've MFAs. There is art...and something
other...something little...something nice and fine and
democratic...but not literary, nor long term, nor of
cultural value. Stand up. Our country, the world, an
objective mind wonders, is as stake. And to those,
including myself, who aint able to muster -- Fuck 'em.

Hey,

I'm trying to find a fitting subject for a thesis I'm writing for my Rhetor=
ic class. I'd like to incorporate poetry and rhetoric - but in the modern s=
ense. See, now, I've no clue where to start or how to phrase such a query.

So, who can shout ideas at me - concerning rhetoric and poetry - specifical=
ly modern(ist) tendencies, or contemporary, or whatever. See? Open ended.

Cheers,,
Christophe Casamassima

I'm not sure what the point of this was but if it points out the awkwardnesses of blogs, so be it.  What I've found awkward with blogs is the fact that, in order to leave a comment on a blog, you have to have one.  Since I have one at shantideva2.blogspot.com, this isn't such a problem for me, still it seems unfair that one has to join the club in order to speak.  A friend of mine had to enter her comment under my name on my own blog to do so without setting up her own.  Being even less proficient with computers than I am, she just insisted she didn't want one, which probably meant simply that she wouldn't know what to do with one if she had it.

Tom,

I think this is an important point. I do not have a blog either, and I do no twant to  have to register password and username to send a comment. For me this is more than a technical issue; it is my reluctance to contribute to the growth of data base in the name of some company or other, probably to little avail. As a result I contribute many fewer comments than I would otherwise, and when I really want to I e-mail my comments to the owner of the blog. He or she may deal with them whichever way they prefer. Because of their relative openness, I find lists much more satisfactory.

Murat

MUHAMMED
The prophet of Islam
Monday, February 20, 2006
6:00pm – 8:00 pm


Room A240
Human & Social Development Building
University of Victoria

You may be atheist or an agnostic or you may belong to nay of the
religious denominations that exist in the world today. You may have been
a communist or a believer in democracy and freedom. No matter what you
are, and no matter what your religious and political beliefs, personal
and social habits happen to be; you still must know this man.

The Encyclopedia Britannica calls him “the most successful of all
religious personalities of the world.” George Bernard Shaw said, “If
Muhammad were alive today, he would succeed
In solving all those problems which threaten to destroy human
civilization in our times.”

This lecture is designed to provide a one-hour biography of the life of
the most remarkable
Man that ever set foot on this earth. He preach a religion, founded a
state, built a nation, laid
Down a moral code, initiated numberless social and political reforms,
and he revolutionized
The world of human thought and human thought and human action for all times.

A question & answer session will also be held after the lecture.
Refreshments will be served
As well.

Sponsored by the Muslim student association.

Juvenile Steps Up and Lets Bush, Cheney and Mayor Nagin Have It By Davey D

The day after last August’s devastating Hurricane tore through New
Orleans, Juvenile was immediately on the scene trying to help out. This
was in spite of the fact that he along with many of his family and
friends suffered horrific loses in the Crescent City’s 9th Ward.

Juve sat a BET press conference and pledged to do concerts to raise
money and use his celebrity status to bring attention to those who had
no voice. During that press conference Juvenile refrained from overtly
criticizing the government even though it was painfully obvious that
FEMA was asleep on the job.

Fast forward to February 2006, Juvenile is pulling no punches. He’s
doing more than just putting the government on blast for being
negligent, he’s gone so far as to do a video for a his new song Rodeo
that was shot in the 9th Ward where he shows caricatures of George Bush,
Dick Cheney and New Orleans’s Mayor Ray Nagin as the bad guys who
contributed to all the devastation.

Juve swung through the Bay Area this past weekend and spoke passionately
about all the neglect that is going on in his city. He explained that he
and his crew went through a lot of red tape just to shoot the video.
Apparently city officials weren’t too keen on him showing the world
what’s really going on. They cited chemical dangers and the threat of
contamination as the reasons he could not shoot the video. Juvenile got
around that hurdle.

It will be interesting to see if Juve gets any sort of airplay for his
video without the faces of Bush, Cheney and Nagin being etched out. Juve
was very clear about the statement he wants to make. Those three men
need to be held accountable for the slow response and the current
exploitation that is taking place in NO.

Juve noted that the government has been quick to repair all the tourist
areas. He said the French Quarter and the Superdome are repaired or on
their way to being completely fixed up. In the meantime places like the
9th Ward where the majority of the city’s population resided has been
left to rot. Juve was clear that this has to do with the racial make up
of the city’s residents.

He pointed out that as a Black man, he could relate to fellow rapper
Kanye West’s remarks about Bush not caring about Black people. He said
he waited and waited for the president to prove Kanye wrong. A quick
look at the lack of repair in the 9th Ward is proof positive that Kanye
was absolutely right.

Juvenile told the crowd who showed for his album release party that land
developers like Donald Trump have been allowed free access into New
Orleans and he his one of many rich land grabbers who is quickly buying
up property.

Juve also explained that a lot of the money that has been sent to NO has
NOT been reaching the community. He urged people to directly get a hold
of folks and make sure they are given what’s needed. He cited the work
that people like Ludacris has been doing where he has brought up houses
and personally seen to it that families are housed and taken care of
Juvenile also noted that we should be making sure folks get a right to
return home and be given the opportunity to rebuild. Currently the city
has been playing the racial games by pitting Blacks against Mexicans. He
said that they been busing in Mexicans to work in the devastated Black
areas even though NO has been a Black and white city. He said it’s a
slap in the face for both races as they are being played by white folks
who are trying to control everything.

Juvenile also shed some light on the some of the military actions that
took place shortly after the hurricane. He talked about the infamous
scene on the Gretna Bridge where white sheriffs shot at Black folks
trying to flee the devastation and made them turn away from the city’s
only escape route. He explained that the military was sent in with shoot
to kill orders and that this added to the heartbreak and devastation.

Juvenile saved his harshest criticism for the media. He called 0out
everyone including MTV, BET, ABC, CBS and FOX News. He talked about
their lack of coverage from the perspective of those most victimized. He
also talked about how these news agencies would fly helicopters over the
ravaged areas where victims were stranded on roof tops and would only
film the horrors and not use their resources to drop food supplies and
survival kits. Juve was really upset with the racist coverage from Fox
News and says he is currently on a ‘Fuck Fox Campaign’

I think this is an important point. I do not have a blog either, and I do no twant to  have to register password and username to send a comment. For me this is more than a technical issue; it is my reluctance to contribute to the growth of data base in the name of some company or other, probably to little avail. As a result I contribute many fewer comments than I would otherwise, and when I really want to I e-mail my comments to the owner of the blog. He or she may deal with them whichever way they prefer. Because of their relative openness, I find lists much more satisfactory.

What I've found awkward with blogs is the fact that, in order to leave a comment on a blog, you have to have one.  Since I have one at shantideva2.blogspot.com, this isn't such a problem for me, still it seems unfair that one has to join the club in order to speak.  A friend of mine had to enter her comment under my name on my own blog to do so without setting up her own.  Being even less proficient with computers than I am, she just insisted she didn't want one, which probably meant simply that she wouldn't know what to do with one if she had it.

HOW TO READ. WHAT TO DO: THE FUTURE OF POETRY CRITICISM
http://poetics.uchicago.edu/critconf.html
Friday, March 3 - Saturday, March 4, 2006

Is there such a thing as poetry criticism?

Successive waves of theory have worn the sharp edges from most =20
attempts to delineate the genre of lyric, to distinguish poetic from =20
ordinary language, or to describe poetry as a special place where the =20=

structure and operation of language reveal themselves. At present, =20
literary criticism tends to regard =93poetry=94 less as a singular =20
practice, and more as a name for a changeable set of desires and =20
cultural ambitions.

But despite the particularizing tendencies of our historicist =20
criticism, there remain critics of poetry who continue to read and to =20=

write about poems as though they were part of a single tradition. How =20=

to Read.  What to Do:   The Future of Poetry Criticism gathers =20
together critics to make conscious sense of our common-sense =20
practices of reading.  Working closely with poems across traditions, =20
periods and languages, we will examine the practical intuition that =20
=93poetry is a whole,=94 and to imagine ways in which it might be =20
considered so.

Keston Sutherland - from NEOCOSIS

Pape zero aleppe: none of this is always what
you eat to survive, surviving to sing
a new tune all about having none of it: something
understood not fit to be wasted on understanding,
not brittle in the crammed mouth sick of air
but instead flatly indisintegrable, banished by love
and its sweetest decree to the fringes of red anti-gut,
where love alone shines in beauty, and the liver
waits agape on brass for its flame, and is licked
forever by that flame like a mirror by your eyelids.

 =46rom a review of NEOCOSIS by Robert Potts in The Observer, February =20=

12th 2006

"Within Sutherland's grotesque cabaret, we encounter many real-life =20
characters, such as Roger Ailes, the genius of Republican-biased =20
television since the Nixon era, now head of Fox; Albert Wohlstetter, =20
advocate of precision bombing and limited nuclear war and Michael =20
Levin, an NYU professor who advocates torture. Sutherland's poetry is =20=

nearer to scratch video than heroic couplets, farcically remixing the =20=

conventional metaphors of political discussion, sampling bin Laden =20
and the chatter of Fox-dominated radio frequencies and wrestling self-=20=

consciously with his vestigial literary options. It is ferociously =20
complex; he is picking apart those awkward details and ideas that we =20
don't often find in the media. But his poetry's questions - how to =20
write about (and live within) a reality of money, massacre, media =20
ownership, geopolitics and individual impotence - are clear enough. =20
If you want to know what a committed but undogmatic poetry might look =20=

like in the era of Gitmo and Abu Ghraib, this is one place to start."


Matt Ffytche - from WHAT FELL OUT IN LIFE

in front is a ragged case streamed
with alternate wishes, and a home
guidance: this is felt by many to
wind a message out of it right by
teeth. Somewhere clouds of care
delicately balanced aside, that grey
whiplash dawn. So are the wings
tied in facer - bending aside the
same distance, at the first planet
hazard. The pattern melts across
our back, branded with terrific
shouts, iron beams of the cast-
around. Flowers at the wrist the
whole front timed repeating on.


Neil Pattison - from PREFERENCES

We could hang any dawn from here=92s window, to turn from release to =20
futures to lift our city out, know all those outreaches of convex =20
preserve her. Then what is drawn out, and how far ? Emergent codas, =20
punctual, but dispersed across the making curve, prove our dumb =20
reliance on infinite lift. Cry out, then. Show me. Show a spirit of =20
not dying, & of not wanting to, sealed in the ornamental smash of =20
correlation, and the force appointed song.

But this is not our city, & you are sleeping, not yet acquired for. =20
Things we have needed, places risen to the language, routes opened or =20=

recovered, signals to bypass. We are in the event. The fast horizon =20
for a kinetic here entails the eventual as a decorum glossed with =20
stricture, held against curvation=92s tact. There will have its time =20
endure, day=92s neighbour strung to the brink of placement=92s liberal =20=

dispense. Acquisition has these assurances. Wake up. Shop.

Vincent Katz on Sextus Propertius
Thursday, February 16, 7pm
Poets House, 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, NYC
$7, Free to Members

Poet and translator Vincent Katz reads and discusses ancient Greek and Roman
poems that formed the poetic context of the 1st century BC Roman poet,
Sextus Propertius. He discusses Propertius' views on poetry, love poetry in
particular, and how Propertius believed that love poetry should be valued as
highly as epic poetry. Katz also speaks about the effects of translation
vis-a-vis his own poetry and Ezra Pound's writings and thoughts on
Propertius.

Vincent Katz won the 2005 National Translation Award for his book, The
Complete Elegies of Sextus Propertius (Princeton University Press).

Subject:      HE'S A FUCKING LIAR!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Was having drinks with this guy I know who is OBSESSED with
the James Frey MILLION LITTLE PIECES controversy.

Overloaded on the bar's whiskey specials he exploded when I asked
him why it was such a big deal to him, "HE'S A FUCKING LIAR!"

On one hand the incident over the validity of this book as an honest
memoir is a dimple compared to the shit our president wants us to
believe he believed about WMDs in Iraq.

Could it be that the anger over Frey is some sort of collective, national
outcry because people are tired of lies, want "truth"? That at least  with
this they can have a voice against someone lying when they feel
powerless over Bush's lies?

Or is it really that big of a deal?

As I like to point out, James Frey REALLY DID originally say that he
wanted the book to be classified as "Fiction" on bookstore shelves,
and on the jacket, etc..  The publisher however is riding that WAVE  of
the memoir fad going on right now, so, was convinced, and convinced
Frey that memoir was the way.

I'm a little more concerned about the "truth" Fox News (aka Newspeak)
presents about what's going on in Iraq.

And here's a newish poem from me for ya:

A NEW HYMN TO THE OLD NIGHT

                       After Friedrich von Hardenberg

afar lies the world

or down over there, far, lies the world

or the world lies to us Novalis

dead as waking day in joyous light

or just covered in glitter

part cliché, part cage

part musky smell of dust burning off the radiator

another November, another animal moving across the earth

another breeze & someone to call it gentle

any stranger, any shapely mouth, any sound dissolving to noise

noise & its fringe theater sustaining an open call

gull against those clouds, pebble lodged in a sneaker’s tread

who isn’t a boy in party dress in presence’s wide drama

another mark on paper & someone to learn the names

another character gone to the season’s closer

snow in the garden on the television facing the window near the taxi stand

snow on the staircase in the house on the ruined street where the novel ends

blue black night, blue-black distant constellations

& someone to call the camp fires happiness

to cull vapid contingencies from vapid rainfall

annulling a vapid image in place of itself

replacing vacancy in one’s unwokeness

you try explaining a computer to the long dead

forget almond trees, grapes & poppies

what he wouldn’t believe is the inescapable music here

the night filling with beloved firetrucks

cover your ears to cover the passing sirens

praise the passing sirens

praise clouds in the shape of a nightlight

praise meticulousness

praise the trail of the centipede

& the impulsive curve of a halo in impasto on paper

& pursue the legibility of all signs

endless morning’s eroded surface & the surface of ordinary sense

praise the redundancy of self-ascribed visionaries pursuing burning
dictionaries

is it better to be careful or to care only for fullness

the dog’s head drops in shame, cocks in question

praise human complication’s damaged form

receding from fight or flight to leaky cathedral

perfect as a linoleum print of lifelike grass

& the wind ribboning an afternoon straight out of Seurat

yield to passing traffic then praise the passing traffic

they look so small down there

soaked in linseed oil, semi-translucent

through the smeared window of a newspaper box

across headlines large as water towers

painted in tandem with a clear day

the quiet house & calm world, too, are deserving of praise

praise the roof against which breaks urbanity & pursue the joyous leak

praise the house, the keeper of the house & those for whom the house is kept

praise Mexico, go to Mexico, be continuously afraid of nothing

find Pancho Villa’s Dodge, plastered with bullet holes

proud as supreme realism condensed in the face of a blue flower

what’s luminous about a clock, what’s a spiky detail

which is worse, the balance beam or the laser beam

dreams don’t bring back the dead

they affix microphones to iconography

praising the tissue of sleep, pleated as Sophie’s rotting hair

praise wickedness in clocks, sun & all variants on rooftops

the most beautiful insects can only sting once

praise the beautiful insects

the most beautiful insects can only sting once

praise the exhaustion of the most beautiful insects

It's the whole ends justifying the means pabulum that US citizens have
been fed (and lapping up) for the last six years. Truthiness comes into
play as well. "reality" TV, "fair and balanced reporting" we had two
congressmen vying for the seat of disgraced Tom Delay and the best
either could come up with was that he was not as tainted as his
opponent. Sprinkle on top the new speak of this administration i.e.
patriot act, clean skies initiative and you've got the just deserts of
of a disinterested populace.

The reason that Frey rose above the fray, was that his sordid little web
snagged the high priestess of pop culture.

If only we could get Oprah to state her opinions on unwarranted
wiretapping...

hey Chris, seriously, you wrote a memoir titled RADIO ORPHAN!?  That's  a
great title, and it's also an interesting branch of the conversation to  talk
about
"the new censorship" for not having the proper amount of circus for
readers/publishers/Oprah, etc..

Thrown RIGHT INTO JT LeRoy are we?  Okay.  This is where I sort  of feel like
I'm not living up to my casual nature from the other night with this guy on
the
issue of MILLION LITTLE PIECES, because of the kinds of lies.

Meaning, JT LeRoy claimed to have AIDS.  And I was working at  Giovanni's
Room the year SARAH came out, and we even had the British edition  with
the much cooler cover (probably one of the few places in US with this
edition)
there were SO MANY older gay men who bought SARAH, and would stop to
tell me heart break after heart break of who they had lost in the  80s.  So
those
men are who are on my mind now with the JT LeRoy scandal.  Also, I'm  not
too fond of people claiming to be poor when they're not, since I've been
poor,
and at times REALLY poor, especially as a kid.

Chris, did you know the poet Bill Shields?  The Vietnam Vet poet who  was
published by Henry Rollins?  It just came out, in fact around the same  time
that the JT LeRoy outing occurred, that Shields never served in  Vietnam.
And I defended Bill over and over to people for various reasons to do  with
everything from mental health to performance poetry, blah blah blah.   But
to be honest, the more I think about it the more I remember Bill telling  me
of Vets in hospitals writing him and how he would give them solid advice  on
one thing or another, and how these guys really FELT his poems of  being
in the jungles getting shot at, watching friends die.  It makes me sad  in
about
a dozen different directions, this situation with Shields.  And I'm  wondering
how Henry Rollins feels about it?  Shields was never as famous at JT  LeRoy,
or man, it would really blow up.

The issue of the liars is something I teeter on.  But mostly I'm on  the I
HATE
JT side.  Especially when the news was told to me about the  involvement JT
had with Dennis Cooper.  I mean, WHOA, you fucking piece of shit,  you're
ACTUALLY ON THE PHONE WITH DENNIS COOPER telling him you're sick,
and you're asking him for advice on how to deal with your illness, KNOWING
FULL WELL HOW MANY FRIENDS THAT MAN LOST TO AIDS!?

I really hope JT LeRoy's band comes to Philadelphia so I can vomit on
the drum set, or something!  I feel this need to do something  vile!

Now I feel like I can't defend James Frey.  Well, yes I can  actually
because it's all so gray, all of this.

BUT BACK TO "the new censorship" you make some great points on
your blog about people needing to exploit and even invent in memoir
in order to sell it, get it published.  And I repeat from my original  post
on Frey's book, he really DID SAY FROM THE START that he wanted
the book shelved as Fiction.  It was the publisher who pushed for  the
book being classified a Memoir.

Poetics Listers:

I have noticed some postings regarding China and oppression on the list. I
would like to propose that we act rather than talk about this because it is
important. As of this writing literally hundreds of writers, poets, and
essayists are either in work camps, silenced, or unable to act as writers
because of Chinese government policies. I for one had lunch with a poet in
Guangzhou last year who today is in internal exile unable to communicate
with the outside world because of poems he wrote about environmental
destruction on the Pearl River Estuary. It would be unfair to ask academic
institutions, for profit presses, or Chinese poets themselves to commit
professional or even personal suicide by speaking out stridently against
this since the result would be expulsion from China or imprisonment a risk
that I do not have to face as an American.

Having said this it is unacceptable because of China's newfound economic
power and the fact that so many US companies want to make money in China
(Read Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Walmart) that no one challenges what is
happening in China vis a vis free expression. Even Newt Gingrich, no friend
of poets, said, "China is a nation that imprisons poets, that is not
acceptable". I realize that getting poets to say anything is unison is a
problem but I think that it is important that the poetry community globally
does not allow financial concerns to result in the acceptance of the
imprisonment of poets. The reality is that China is getting a free pass and
China is rapidly becoming a major power and it is a power that regularly
imprisons people for what they believe.

If there is anyone else who concerned about this backchannel me so we could
discuss I am interested in opinions and experiences.

Regards

Ray

Oprah and wire tapping, yeah, that would be fantastic!

But let me say this about her, well, a coupla things.

One, I'm ALWAYS defending her in the bookstore where I work when  folks
bring up copies of Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA and freak out about the
Oprah book club paper banner, and crumble it up, and insist I throw it  away.
But I uncrumble it and remark about how SHE put Tolstoy on the NYT
best seller list.  This new translation kicks major ass, and has  people all
over reading Tolstoy, hey, that's not bad!

Where Oprah gets on my last fucking nerve though is her TOTAL  inability
to cross the BIG lines.  For instance, I was working for Metropolitan  Bakery
in Philadelphia the year of Clinton's Presidential Summit, which was  held
in Philly.  Oprah (I heard her with my OWN EARS) get up on stage  (while
I'm serving bread sticks to Nancy Reagan and the scary others)  ACTUALLY
giving this fucking speech that's RIGHT OUT OF the Herbert Hoover  Rule
Book of people gotta pull themselves up by their bootstraps!  Man, it  was
SO HARD to not freak out during that!  I was angry (and somewhat
depressed) after that convention/summit, which was really Clinton's way
of happily disguising his Welfare Reform because every speech was  about
how lucky you are to WORK for no money and NOT have health insurance,
BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN SUCH A GREAT COUNTRY!  Aren't you proud!?
The Right To Work bullshit came up more than once, and man, OH,  there's
just no end to my anger about such things, but my point is that Oprah  did
NOT have any fucking business saying the things she said.  She  should
have been on Jimmy Carter's side, who of course was the ONLY person
on stage NOT talking about how fucking lazy the poor are.

Anyway, yeah, Oprah spit a lot of sparks out on James Frey, so we  know
she's got it in her.  If she and her machine could get wise to what's
needed...

I am curious, too, as to what might be China's equivalent of Quantanamo -
and few of our other globally located, anonymous USA prisons run by the CIA,
not to mention the practices that were reveal at ABU GRAIB, and from what  I
gather, yesterday, that our surveillance system has 375,000 people under
anonymous watch.  I know, such as they, can prisoner poets in Quantanamo
have been able to write poetry on thin concealable shreds of Styrofoam cups.

I am grateful, as I am sure many of us are, that the USA is beginning not to
get a free pass (i.e., not the UN Report on conditions of torture at
Quantanamo that was released today).

Yes,Hans, the issues of censorship in China appear very real. Before moving
in that direction, I, again as I suspect many of us, get stuck looking in
our own government mirror of censorship, repression, torture, etc. -
particularly with anything that smacks of opposition to its assumed powers,
or, as you say, "for what they believe".

Unlike Newt Gingrich on China, I hope you find the domestic situation on
prisons with the Bush/Cheney regime a provocative and troubling enigma, as
well.

Many knods to Ray. I'm currently in midst of
organizing NGO is one of hill-stations, with local
friends, many refugees, many newcomers. It may not
longer be fashionable, as our new superstar
multi-national firms compromise what are suppose to be
our principals, but the issue is real, people with
tears and disempowered forms express themselves or
what was today. How say? I'm returning in June.

"positive thinking" has by and large replaced "bootstrapping" in the =
areas
of adapted sales techniques and therapy lite talk presenters like Oprah
converse with

Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, Horatio Alger, et.al., could have =
been
what you meant, but

: From "Heavens to Betsy" by Charles Earle Funk (Harper & Row, New York,
1955):=20
: "TO LIFT (or hoist or pull up) ONESELF BY THE BOOTSTRAPS - You may =
travel
all over the United States, North, South, East or West, or in any part =
of
Canada or England, and find almost no one who isn't familiar with one =
form
or another of this expression. It is hardly necessary to say that by its =
use
we mean to raise oneself through one's unaided efforts above one's =
former
cultural, social, or economic level. And yet, beyond being able to state
positively that the expression cannot be more than 350 years old, I =
cannot
say in what English-speaking country it originated, or even whether it =
dates
back to the time of George Washington and George the Third of England,
though I am almost certain that it is considerably older. That is, I =
myself
have not been able to turn up any printed use or record of this common
expression at any date earlier than about ten years ago. It occurs on =
page
456 of 'The Beards' Basic History of the United States' (1944) by =
Charles A.
and Mary R. Beard. Undoubtedly it has appeared earlier, but no =
dictionary
nor other reference work has made note of it. Yet I have seen it in =
print
several times since. In fact, I cannot even tell you nor hazard a guess =
as
to how old the compound word 'bootstrap' may be. The earliest printed
record, as far as I have been able to discover, is in the Funk & =
Wagnalls
Standard dictionary, 1894; and there it appears only in the definitions =
of
two related words - boot-hook and strap.But this strap was known to
Shakespeare. In 'Twelfth Night,' (1601), Act I, scene 3, Sir Toby Belch
makes the comment: 'These cloathes are good enough to drink in: and so =
bee
these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselues in their owne
straps.'.the expression (lift oneself by the bootstraps) alludes to the
struggle from early date to late date in inserting one's foot into a
well-fitting boot.The bootstrap was invented to give the would-be wearer =
a
better purchase."=20

A good many things go around in the dark besides Santa Claus.=20
Herbert Hoover=20

Capitalists are no more capable of self-sacrifice than a man is capable =
of
lifting himself up by his own bootstraps.=20

Digital critique of Linda Hogan's "The Book of Medicines":

http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Critique/Hogan/intro.htm


-Joel



Joel,
Your post wandered over to the Wompo list. Here's a copy of the response I sent
to it:

It's wonderful to see Linda Hogan's extraordinary
collection THE BOOK OF MEDICINES getting some
attention here. I think it is one of the finest
books of our time. I had been thinking of Hogan in
relation to the discussion on lineation. I've just
finished teaching The Book of Medicines in my 'Native
American Poetry' seminar and spent some time with the
students (several of whom are poets) talking about
Hogan's deceptively quiet line. And certainly she is
an
important poet of place, someone who writes about
land, body, spirit with great power and beauty
and sorrow.

That said, I'm troubled by some aspects of the
Hogan digital critique website cited here. Hogan's
poems are quoted with little regard for her chosen
lineation. Her sensibility is located in a mushy
Amerindian-shamanistic-NewAgey cosmos that does
it agreat disservice. I also feel there are claims on
the site that may not actually be in error but which
are misleading, touching about complex historical
events with such slightness as to leave out crucial
complications. These sentences, for instance:
"As Hogan is part-Chickasaw, Amerindian
traditions, visions, history and conditions are
central to her work. Even while echoing the past, her
questions are
of current concerns about environment and
habitantion
(sic). . ."

Hogan is mixblood and writes about that aspect of her
lived existence in both her poetry and her prose. But
she IS Chickasaw, that is, an enrolled member of
a sovereign nation.  More troubling, though, is the
second sentence, which relegates "Amerindian
traditions" to "the past."

And this, this is so wierdly offensive I can't
think of how to comment on it:

"Many Amerindian poets learned their tradition
from stories they heard from grandparents, read in
books, picked up at pow-wows and academic conferences.

They entered as they would a tree, embracing it; still

it refused them entrance. Some cut it down. Others
became obsessed with being "Native American." It is
their heritage, after all, their identity."

The rest of the 'history' rendered here is also
flawed. The site seems to imply that the
Southeastern tribes (there were 5, not 4--the author
seems to have
disappeared the Seminole) all sided with the
Confederacy (in fact there were major divisions in
some of the tribes) and that they only did so in
order to hold onto their slaves.

I'm also troubled by the way the 'critique' ends,
suggesting that Hogan's Book of Medicines is
relentlessly focused on destruction. Instead, the
volume ends with a poem of faith in renewal:

. . .
so after the long sleep of seeds
all things will grow
and the plants who climb into this world
will find it green and alive.

i don't know. do you consider yourself involved in digital literature? do
you know canadian writers who probably would consider themselves involved in
it?

currently, poets applying to the canada council either apply to the poemy
poem program or to media arts. the poemy poem program is geared toward
print. the media arts program is geared toward film, visual art, and audio
art, and emphasizes performance and gallery installation rather than
publishing to things like the web, the net, or cd/dvd. and there's a level
of technical sophistication involved in media art that most digital writers
don't aspire to. so digital literature doesn't get much money from the
canada council.

but things are changing. slowly. there are serious writers whose focus is
not publishing in print mags and publishing books but, instead, focus on
publishing either online or to cd/dvd or they create installations and
whatnot. usually they publish at least the odd thing to print but it isn't
their primary focus.

the canada council had an 'electronic word' program a few years ago (the
'spoken word and electronic word' section) but they canned it. because of
low application numbers and a sense that the writers had no audience. i've
asked them for a doc on why it was canned.

over time, digital literature will grow. because the use of computers and
networks is growing; because media can be combined in computers, ie, the
intermedial dimensions; because it's relatively unexplored literary
territory; because it's international and fluid; because that's how
communication is going and how language is being shaped.

the question is whether it be now. yet it will be.

the canada council will eventually do something. but hopefully there's
enough activity now to prompt them to do it now.

we'll see. part of the idea of putting this doc together is to also create a
list of the writers/artists in canada creating 'digital literature'.

So much goes away

Forms are now shades,
those solid weights, how empty they are,
mere boxes,
the whispering voice,
the ankle bone only an arch.

Peasants once sowed this valley
there isn't any wheat here or oats
there almost isn't a valley,
only a dent.

This morning was all concaveness,
the clouds drew back into themselves,
the clouds went so far away leaving it blue,
now we're quite convex
and the rain is emptying itself out on me

The rain that took weeks to return,
the rain that left us on Wednesday
after tears, after dark, after that sluicing
about in memory, fishing up

The rain is here now.

'It makes for change and a certain disagreeableness
this coming and going makes one nervous'

The farewells to buildings
and then to the hole in the ground

This hello on one's lips
to a new perspective
finished by the end of the week,
completed a fresh horizon line

The earth is old, no longer fragrant
those planets are promising,

Goodbye, hello.

Yet you who had vanished
you trailing your garments
who went away in that last March stanza
not liking the violins
or standing around waiting
your arms circling each other's waists
or the salt in your mouth
where the sea was whipping itself up in the corner
and foam falling like ash

You departed divine Muses
without warning

And I went on a diet
I stopped eating regularly,
I changed my ways several times

"strict discipline, continuous devotion,
receptiveness"

were mine.

Here you are back again. Welcome.

Farewell, 'strict, continuous, receptive'--

There's that old shawl in the corner
looking like a wave

There's a ringing in my ears
as if a poem were beating on stone

The room fills now with feathers,
the birds you have released, Muses,

I want to stop whatever I am doing
and listen to their marvellous hello.

Many knods to Ray. I'm currently in midst of organizing NGO is one of
hill-stations, with local friends, many refugees, many newcomers. It may not
longer be fashionable, as our new superstar multi-national firms compromise
what are suppose to be our principals, but the issue is real, people with
tears and disempowered forms express themselves or what was today. How say?
I'm returning in June.

  Yes. Andrew Topel thought it was really cool to incessantly attack me about a friend of mine, Carl Thayler, right after his death, to the point where I needed outside help to block his harrasing e-mails. He deserves a senseless beating. If someone would like to administer it, I hear he now lives in Indiana.

Subject:      Deutsche: Charles Olson and Jan Erik Vold, line indentations
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I should like to clarify what Rolf has said in his post in December - sorry
to be so late with this - the publishers firm we have spoken to is linked to
the University of Aachen, not the University of Aarhus in Denmark.

The first volume planned are the Collected Charles Olson and the
"prose-poems" of Jan Erik Vold (not "Vole" which is a small animal!). We yet
have to choose translator for Vold.

The decision to print the German translations of the poems without the
original erratic line indentations and eccentric inter-word spacing , but
instead with a clean left margin, is not meant as a criticism of the author,
as Rolf would seem to think. Rather it is an attempt to establish a
scientific reification of the poem as a primary auditory phenomenon which is
precisely in accord with Mr Olson's wishes as expressed already in his
now-famous Essay on Projective Verse, in which he writes "If a contemporary
poet leaves a space as long as the phrase before it, he [sic] means that
space to be held, by the breath an equal length of time." This is no doubt
his intention at the time of writing his paper.

Yet in the results from the acoustic research myself and many other
investigators have conducted, there is a poor positive correlation (in most
cases the correlation coefficient is less than .20) between the indentation
measured in ems (a typographical measure) and the corresponding "pause" or
"neutral verbal space" in vocal performance measured in seconds, even by the
same authors of the poems, including Biermann, Vold, Brink, Olson et alia.
We have borne many objections to this point, but the graphs are unequivocal
here.

Please refer to "The Psychoacoustic Perception of Duration in Performance"
(Moritz and Breytenbach, Uppsala universitet, 1966) and "The Presentation of
Self: a Vocal Art" (Breytenbach, Universiteit Leiden, 1971), my own PhD
thesis "Duration: A Objective Analysis" and Harald Flensing's
ground-breaking work on Jan Erik Vold in performance, titled "Graphing the
Bard: Two-Dimensional Translation of Verbal Performance as a Psycho-Acoustic
Event in Time" (Universitetet i Oslo). Flensing is insightful regarding the
lack of fit between the self-perceived performance time and
objectively-measured events in the laboratory situations.

The first text has been a long time in process. We are hoping early April
for publication.

Dieter H.

Apple's ode to hackers
Developers embed poetic warning deep in OS X software

(if appears that Apple is desperately in need of a poet in residence...)


Friday, February 17, 2006; Posted: 10:32 a.m. EST (15:32 GMT)


Apple developers embedded a warning deep in its OS X software -- in
the form of a poem.

SAN JOSE, California (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. has resorted to a
poetic broadside in the inevitable cat-and-mouse game between hackers
and high-tech companies.

The maker of Macintosh computers had anticipated that hackers would
try to crack its new OS X operating system built to work on Intel
Corp.'s chips and run pirated versions on non-Apple computers. So,
Apple developers embedded a warning deep in the software -- in the
form of a poem.

Indeed, a hacker encountered the poem recently, and a copy of it has
been circulating on Mac-user Web sites this week.

Apple confirmed Thursday it has included such a warning in its Intel-
based computers since it started selling them in January.

The embedded poem reads:

"Your karma check for today:
There once was a user that whined
his existing OS was so blind
he'd do better to pirate
an OS that ran great
but found his hardware declined.
Please don't steal Mac OS!
Really, that's way uncool.
(C) Apple Computer, Inc."

Apple also put in a separate hidden message, "Don't Steal Mac OS
X.kext," in another spot for would-be hackers.
"We can confirm that this text is built into our products," Apple
issued in a statement. "Hopefully it, and many other legal warnings,
will remind people that they should not steal Mac OS X."

The hacking endeavors are, for now, relegated to a small, technically
savvy set, but it underscores a risk Apple faces if a pirated,
functional version eventually becomes as accessible and
straightforward as installing other software on a computer.

It's a risk that became apparent after Apple decided to make a
historic transition to Intel-based chips, the same type that its
rivals use in predominant Windows-based PCs. Apple previously relied
on Power PC chips from IBM Corp. and Freescale Semiconductor Inc.,
but this year began switching its computers to the Intel platform.

Various analysts have since hypothesized a worst-case situation in
which Apple would lose control of its proprietary Macintosh
environment: how its reputedly easy-to-use and elegant operating
system would no longer be locked to its computers, a critical revenue
pipeline for Apple.

Such scenarios have raised a debate among Apple observers about
whether the company should just license its operating system to run
on other machines, similar to Microsoft Corp.

But Apple has repeatedly said it will not do that.

Meanwhile, security experts on Thursday identified a new computer
worm that specifically targets Mac computers running OS X -- a rarity
since most worms target the broader base of PCs with Microsoft's
Windows. Experts, however, consider the threat low.

EXCERPTS from FACING REALITY

The whole world today lives in the shadow of the state power. This =20
state power is an ever-present self-perpetuating body over and above =20
society. It transforms the human personality into a mass of economic =20
needs to be satisfied by decimal points of economic progress. It robs =20=

everyone of initiative and clogs the free development of society. =20
This state power, by whatever name it is called, One-Party State or =20
Welfare State, destroys all pretense of government by the people, of =20
the people. All that remains is government for the people.

Against this monster, people all over the world, and particularly =20
ordinary working people in factories, mines, fields, and offices, are =20=

rebelling every day in ways of their own invention. Sometimes their =20
struggles are on a small personal scale. More effectively, they are =20
the actions of groups, formal or informal, but always unofficial, =20
organized around their work and their place of work. Always the aim =20
is to regain control over their own conditions of life and their =20
relations with one another. Their strivings, their struggles, their =20
methods have few chroniclers. They themselves are constantly =20
attempting various forms of organization, uncertain of where the =20
struggle is going to end. Nevertheless, they are imbued with one =20
fundamental certainty, that they have to destroy the continuously =20
mounting bureaucratic mass or be themselves destroyed by it.

The Marxist organization organizes itself to produce a paper which =20
will recognize the existence of the new society and record the facts =20
of its existence. We have outlined the practical method with which =20
this must be approached. It is not everything, but it is enough.

Experience has shown that a single worker, a member of a Marxist =20
organization, can gather around him a dozen workers, men and women, =20
who meet regularly for the sole purpose of writing, discussing, and =20
editing articles for immediate publication; and immediate publication =20=

means not a theoretical journal but a weekly or a fortnightly paper.

The break with the old type of Marxist journal is complete. The old =20
type of journal consisted, and, where persisting, still consists of =20
articles written by intellectuals and advanced workers, telling the =20
workers what to think, what to do, how to make =93the revolution,=94 =
and, =20
the ultimate summit of understanding and wisdom, to join the small =20
organization. The journal contemplated here will do not the opposite =20
but something entirely different. It exists so that workers and other =20=

ordinary people will tell each other and people like themselves what =20
they are thinking, what they are doing, and what they want to do. In =20
the course of so doing, the intellectuals and advanced workers, both =20
inside and outside the organization, will have their opportunity to =20
learn. There is no other way.

To publish such a paper as we outline demands, besides deep =20
theoretical understanding, technical knowledge, journalistic skill, a =20=

sense of values, flexibility and firmness, combined to an exceptional =20=

degree. Some of these can to some extent be studied in isolation, but =20=

today their full application and development can only be achieved in =20
what we have shown are the vast implications contained in the =20
formula: to recognize the existence and record the facts of the new =20
society.

In one department of a certain plant in the United States, there is a =20=

worker who is physically incapable of carrying out his duties. But he =20=

is a man with a wife and children, and his condition is due to the =20
previous strain of his work in the plant. The workers in that =20
department have organized their work so that for nearly ten years he =20
has had practically nothing to do. They have defied all efforts of =20
the foreman and supervision to discharge him, threatening to throw =20
the whole plant into disorder if any steps are taken to dismiss the =20
invalid. That is the socialist society. Careful observation will show =20=

that such enormous problems as work for the old, the handicapped, the =20=

young, of both sexes, can be easily and competently handled without =20
any bureaucratic apparatus whatever, by the good sense of workers as =20
long as they have the power to arrange their labor as they wish. =20
Workers tell such episodes by the dozen. No bourgeois nor trade union =20=

journal ever prints any.

In another plant in the United States the company tried by a maneuver =20=

to prevent a Negro driver being given the job of dispatcher to which =20
his seniority entitled him. The Negro workers in the plant called a =20
meeting and gave the company a certain deadline to upgrade this =20
worker to the job which was his by right. Before their united =20
determination the company capitulated. Thus these workers had struck =20
a blow against common injustice, racial discrimination, and the =20
disorder in production which management creates. That is the =20
socialist society. It hasn=92t to be organized in the future. It =20
exists. It is organized. It has to get rid of what is stifling it, =20
what is preventing it from expanding to the full, what is preventing =20
it from tackling not only the immediate problem of production, but =20
also the more general problems of society. But it exists.

In a British airport the security officers salute their superiors in =20
accordance with the semi-military discipline that prevails in this =20
type of public service. One of their representatives, on going to =20
discuss union matters with management, refused to salute, claiming =20
that in this relation he and the representative of management met as =20
equals. The representative of management, quite obviously a man of =20
semi-feudal mentality, demanded the right to be saluted. The whole =20
section of workers went out on strike immediately, and in the end, =20
management capitulated. That is the socialist society.

Workers refer to these struggles as attempts to correct =93local =20
grievances=94 and to =93improve working conditions.=94 Yet to the terror =
of =20
management and the perpetual astonishment of people who are not =20
familiar with the working class, workers are ready to bring =20
production to a stop and endure the greatest privations for weeks and =20=

months over what seems to the ordinary observer to be trifles. To =20
workers it is precisely the power to carry all these ideas and wishes =20=

of theirs to completeness which constitutes the new society.

The Hungarian Workers Councils not only made appeals to the Russian =20
troops to cease fire and go home. They entered into negotiations and =20
made direct arrangements with Russian commanders to retire. At least =20
one Council not only negotiated the removal of a garrison of Russian =20
troops but arranged for it to be supplied with food. This was not =20
just fraternization. It was the assumption of responsibility by the =20
Workers Councils for foreign affairs. The simplicity with which the =20
negotiations were carried out reflects the education which the post-=20
war world has received in the futile bickering and cynical =20
propagandizing of cease-fire conferences in Korea, Big Four meetings =20
in London and Paris, and Big Two meetings in Geneva. Russian troops =20
mutinied and deserted to fight under the command of the Hungarian =20
Councils. When the hospital at Debrecen radioed its needs for iron =20
lungs, the Workers Councils at Miskolc undertook to get these from =20
West Germany and by radio organized the landing of the lung-bearing =20
plane at the Debrecen airport. The Hungarian Revolution transcended =20
that combination of threats, snarls lies, hypocrisy, and brutality =20
which today appear under the headlines of foreign affairs.

=85The Hungarian Revolution has uncovered, for the whole world to see, =20=

the goal to which the struggles against bureaucracy are moving. The =20
Hungarian people have restored the belief of the Nineteenth Century =20
in progress. They have restored to the revolutionary socialist =20
movement the conviction that the future lies with the power of the =20
working class and the great masses of the people.

The secret of the Workers Councils is this. =46rom the very start of =20
the Hungarian Revolution, these shop floor organizations of the =20
workers demonstrated such conscious mastery of the needs, processes, =20
and inter-relations of production, that they did not have to exercise =20=

any domination over people. That mastery is the only basis of =20
political power against the bureaucratic state. It is the very =20
essence of any government which is to be based upon general consent =20
and not on force. The administration of things by the Workers =20
Councils established a basic coherence in society and from this =20
coherence they derived automatically their right to govern. Workers=92 =20=

management of production, government from below, and government by =20
consent have thus been shown to be one and the same thing.

Somewhat reminds me of a letter I received from Thomas Arp in the early =

I should like to clarify what Rolf has said in his post in December - =
sorry=20
to be so late with this - the publishers firm we have spoken to is =
linked to

the University of Aachen, not the University of Aarhus in Denmark.

The first volume planned are the Collected Charles Olson and the=20
"prose-poems" of Jan Erik Vold (not "Vole" which is a small animal!). We =
yet

have to choose translator for Vold.

The decision to print the German translations of the poems without the=20
original erratic line indentations and eccentric inter-word spacing , =
but=20
instead with a clean left margin, is not meant as a criticism of the =
author,

as Rolf would seem to think. Rather it is an attempt to establish a=20
scientific reification of the poem as a primary auditory phenomenon =
which is

precisely in accord with Mr Olson's wishes as expressed already in his=20
now-famous Essay on Projective Verse, in which he writes "If a =
contemporary=20
poet leaves a space as long as the phrase before it, he [sic] means that =

space to be held, by the breath an equal length of time." This is no =
doubt=20
his intention at the time of writing his paper.

Yet in the results from the acoustic research myself and many other=20
investigators have conducted, there is a poor positive correlation (in =
most=20
cases the correlation coefficient is less than .20) between the =
indentation=20
measured in ems (a typographical measure) and the corresponding "pause" =
or=20
"neutral verbal space" in vocal performance measured in seconds, even by =
the

same authors of the poems, including Biermann, Vold, Brink, Olson et =
alia.=20
We have borne many objections to this point, but the graphs are =
unequivocal=20
here.

Please refer to "The Psychoacoustic Perception of Duration in =
Performance"=20
(Moritz and Breytenbach, Uppsala universitet, 1966) and "The =
Presentation of

Self: a Vocal Art" (Breytenbach, Universiteit Leiden, 1971), my own PhD=20
thesis "Duration: A Objective Analysis" and Harald Flensing's=20
ground-breaking work on Jan Erik Vold in performance, titled "Graphing =
the=20
Bard: Two-Dimensional Translation of Verbal Performance as a =
Psycho-Acoustic

Event in Time" (Universitetet i Oslo). Flensing is insightful regarding =
the=20
lack of fit between the self-perceived performance time and=20
objectively-measured events in the laboratory situations.

The first text has been a long time in process. We are hoping early =
April=20
for publication.

I can't help but think this would be a fun performance piece. Invite Dieter
on stage with whoever (Kasey S. Mohammad, Ron Silliman, Bernadette Mayer,
anyone, really, except maybe a predictable formalist??). Dieter, on stage
with the poet and armed with appropriate devices, would measure the poet's
'durations' between words and lines while, in the manner of Steve Benson,
the actual text would be projected up on a screen behind the
reader/performer.
The poet would get 'match' points for equivalences between the printed text
and speech, and some other value laden score for improvising off of or
violating the 'authority' of the text.

This might either totally mess up or totally entrance an audience and what
it would do to or for the interpretation of poetry (either the originating
text or the poet's voice of it) I am far from making any kind of prediction.

I'd be happy to be in the audience.

I'm looking for sources--articles, blogs, whatevers--that discuss the
relationship between Other writing (oppositional, innovative, marginalized,
etc) and the poetry workshop. By workshop I specifically mean the Iowa-method
hand-out-a-poem, discuss&fix-it-as-a-group kind of class. Thanks in advance for
any suggestions.

That also works for the duration of the event in time of my morning putting
on of the socks (even with accounting for time of year and activity for
which I'm preparing). Not to mention other functions of body/belief. And
let's not get started on perceptions of measure and distance.

alright, the will alexander syllabi aren't particularly easy to access

but Harryette Mullen's essays are on proquest if your institution (like the
LA Public library) has access -- I've used one about her future readers
several times --

the will alexander syllabi, the reading lists, and the lectures / his
comments on the poems -- are works of art -- I hope some of these materials
are in the Beyond Baroque archive; I probably have Xeroxes of one or two
somewhere

there's a brief interview at Teachers & Writers with him

Subject:      Neglected Lesbia
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Here's an interesting neglected poet:

Australian poet Lesbia Harford (neé Keogh) was born in 1891. She was the
eldest of four children, and had a defective heart which left her constantly
tired and eventually killed her in her late thirties, in 1927. Raised in
moderate comfort, she soon saw her family slide into poverty with the
bankruptcy of her father, who abandoned the family when Lesbia was around
ten to twelve years old. Her mother's struggle to provide and give her
children an education helped Harford to develop feminist and socialist
views. She practiced free love and though she had a number of involved and
serious relationships she always kept an independent outlook and way of
life. She studied Law in Melbourne (Australia), but ended up doing factory
and clerical work, and joined the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World, or
“Wobblies”), a socialist workers' group. As a IWW member she fought so hard
against conscription in the First World War that she ended up in hospital.
In 1916 the IWW was banned and twelve of the group's members were charged
with conspiracy and sentenced to long periods in prison. Unlike many
socialist writers, she kept her poetry free from propaganda, and though it
reflected the social and economic conditions of her life in a direct way, it
always had a frank and personal tone. Her poems were not published as a
collection in her lifetime, and her reputation has not been amplified by
fame nor buttressed by widespread academic interest.

A large collection of her poems (together with a detailed and insightful
introduction by Drusilla Modjeska) can be found on the University of Sydney
internet site:

http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozpoets/index.html

Janet & all: [sorry if this gets to you more than once - this is my
third try at posting] it might not be as thorough or full-blown a
source as you're looking for, but have you seen - or has anyone seen?
- Marjorie Perloff's column in the Spring 2006 MLA newsletter? It's
titled "'Creative Writing' among the Disciplines" and of course I love
it as she's basically making a plea to English departments to re-think
their criteria for job-openings/applicants ... fewer jobs to teach
"the what" of writing and more to teach "the how" of writing.

‘Palestine could become rallying point of oppressed people

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    Israel today is the pariah of the international community. If Hamas
    organizes and consolidates its power as a government, Palestine
    could become the rallying point of the Islamic and oppressed people
    of the world. ...

Publisher: ‘Palestine could become rallying point of oppressed people’
By FinalCall.com News
Updated Feb 16, 2006, 11:07 am

[On January 25, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas won 76 seats of
the 132-seat Palestinian Legislative Council in a landslide victory over
the ruling Fatah party. The Final Call explorers three differing
viewpoints that provide insight into the volatile mixture of ideas and
attitudes in a region characterized by unpredictability and conflict
since Israel's creation in 1948.]

* Professor: ‘Israel and the United States are mostly to blame’ for
Hamas victory (FCN, 2-16-2006)
* Palestinian activist: ‘There will be as much peace as Israel will
allow’ (FCN, 2-16-2006)

Dr. Kaukab Siddique is an Associate Professor of English at Lincoln
University and the publisher and editor-in-chief of New Trend Magazine,
an Islamic publication dealing with current events and issues relevant
to the worldwide Muslim community. He is the author of several books and
head of Jamaat-al Muslimeen, based in Baltimore, Md.

FC: What are your thoughts on what is being reported as a clear
landslide victory by Hamas?

KS: Hamas’ dominance in Palestine has been quite evident during the last
five years. Israel’s assassinations of its leaders failed to stem its
popularity. In fact, the more the Israelis tried to destroy it, the more
it grew in popularity. The election victory is a serious setback for
Israel, coming on the heels of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the
brain damage suffered by [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon. Hamas’
landslide victory is quite genuine.

FC: Were the results a vote for Hamas and against the current
Palestinian Authority leadership, or was it a demonstration against the
American/Israeli alliance in foreign policy?

KS: The elections were primarily an internal affair. The Palestinian
people have made a choice. They have shown that they trust the Islamic
movement. By contrast, the Fatah Party’s leadership is corrupt,
un-Islamic and untrustworthy. Of course, in Palestine, the issue of
U.S.-Israeli policy blends with the domestic issues. One reason for the
secular regime’s corruption was that it was reliant almost entirely on
handouts from the U.S. and EU. The Fatah leaders have always believed
that the U.S. is the key to a solution of the Palestinian “problem.” By
contrast, Hamas believes that Islam is the solution.

FC: Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as
stating: “Before our very eyes, Hamastan has been created.” What do the
results portend for the Israeli government, especially given the
instability and poor health of Ariel Sharon of the Kadima party?

KS: Israel today is the pariah of the international community. If Hamas
organizes and consolidates its power as a government, Palestine could
become the rallying point of the Islamic and oppressed people of the
world. The Israelis, with U.S. help, will try very hard to make the
Hamas government isolated and lacking in resources. It’s a form of
blackmail, meant to squeeze Hamas to recognize Israel, or fail. Will
Hamas bow before American power and Saudi money? That’s the key question
facing the Muslim world.

FC: Can you clarify the “two state” solution that is supposedly being
advocated by George Bush, why it seems plausible to some and opposed by
others?

KS: The U.S. wants Israel to be recognized as a legitimate country and
Palestine to be formulated in such a way that it would be a defenseless,
client state, totally helpless before and dependent on Israeli power and
American-Saudi economic resources [not very different from the
Bantustans in South Africa under apartheid]. The “two state” solution
simply means that Arabs, Muslims and Africans should accept the “right”
of Europe and America to set up an artificial country, armed and funded
by the U.S., in the heartland of Islam.

Such a solution would be the victory of imperialism. Islam does not
accept the victory of the oppressors. The Qur’an puts it very clearly
that occupation of Muslim land cannot be accepted. It says: “Drive them
out from where they drove you out.”

FC: Where does this leave Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas?

KS: Abbas is seen by the majority of Palestinians as an Israeli agent.
He often sleeps in Tel Aviv and has the protection of Israeli
intelligence services. His time is over. The Israelis arrested hundreds
of Hamas activists before the elections to help Fatah win, but it didn’t
work.

FC: Will Hamas be forced to back down on some of the more strident
rhetoric and positions towards Israel?

KS: Hamas is not monolithic. There are elements in it that are very much
influenced by the U.S. and its surrogates, such as Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt. There will probably be an intense internal dialogue, perhaps even
a tussle, to change the direction of Hamas. The U.S.’ strategy is that
“moderate” Islamic people should be encouraged, and these are seen as
the best solution for the growing influence of “extremists.”

Observers say that one reason the U.S. allowed the elections to go
through was the danger the Americans saw in further radicalization of
the Palestinian people. There was a danger that if Hamas did not win,
there would be big gains in support by Islamic Jihad and even al-Qaeda.
The key to the future lies in the struggle within Hamas. But Allah is
the best of Planners.

FC: Thank you.

Let me clarify a bit about what I meant about the how vs. the what of
writing in relation to Janet's question about Other writing vs. the
poetry workshop: I got this 'how' versus 'what' distinction from
Perloff's column which I (maybe wrongly?) read as aligning the MFA
workshop with the what of writing (ie, anything or anyone that asks
whether it is a poem probably has an aesthetically conservative stance
in mind about what a poem is) and aligning programs like Buffalo
poetics with the how of writing (ie, as MP puts it, a program that
teaches/taught not creative writing but "the creative reading that
made writing possible").  She writes in the last paragraph:

Given these circumstances [namely the 103 job ads in the 2005-2006
Chronicle of Higher Ed.aimed at creative writing job candidates versus
the paltry 36 positions for a specialist in twentieth-century
literature, from whatever country/continent], we can assume that
creating writing will experience a boom--not a creative writing
program along the lines of the old MFA workshop model but one for
those fascinated by and dedicated to the study of rhetoric--the how of
writing rather than the what.  Very few graduates of these programs
will become celebrated writers, and not all the others will
necessarily become professors of creative writing...But the main thing
uniting them will be a love for a field of human interest that just
won't go away...That field is literature--in this case the poetry and
prose of our own past century--a field without which creative writing
could not exist and which, conversely, may currently have no other
place to go.

So, if I'm reading her piece correctly, you can see what I'd love it
as it seems like a plea for jobs to be available for folks like me!

"'A is for Apple' is an interactive [Flash] work that investigates a
cryptography of the apple. Using an ever expanding series of associative

Here's a bit of Danielle Grilli's interview with Vernon Frazer. I  think
Vernon's description of his work is, forgive me, "meaningful."


DG: You have become a forerunner in the art of visual poetry, a process
that's culminated with the release of the full text of IMPROVISATIONS. What has
that process been like?

VF: Actually, I hesitate to call myself a "visual poet" because it seems a
little, as they say, reductive. I've regarded myself as a textual poet who
incorporates visual elements into his work. I didn't even realize I was writing
"visual poetry" until last spring, when, after Carlos Luis curated an
excellent Vispo exhibit in Miami. Michael Rothenberg held some of the later  pages of
IMPROVISATIONS against his dining room wall and had me look at them  as
individual panels, like visual poems.

I'm flattered at being considered a forerunner. To some extent, that's what
I'd hoped to accomplish as a writer. But if I were to try to speculate why I'm
 a  forerunner well, in my fiction I've employed visual elements that I've
only seen Raymond Federman and Robert Matzels do. And IMPROVISATIONS has  been
described as  the longest visual poem written to date. Maybe that  makes it a
forerunner. I consider IMPROVISATIONS a forerunner because it  synthesizes
projective verse, language poetry, surrealism, Dadaism,  concrete poetry and
visual poetry into a unified entity. It might also be  the first long poem-that I
know of, anyway-to be written as a  non-narrative, happening in the moment
while still developing   thematically. It might also be unique in that it moves
from the aural to  the visual and orchestrates the textual and visual
components somewhat like  a musical score.

I find this really confusing...  To call Vernon a forerunner in the
art of visual poetry is pretty bizarre considering all the people
working now who have been doing it for more than 25 years, & visual
poetry itself has a history which is anywhere from a 100 to 5,000
years old depending how you spin it.  I do agree with Vernon's
characterization that he is a "textual poet who incorporates visual
elements into his work" which is a far more useful way of thinking
about IMPROVISATIONS.  Vernon & I have been doing a bit of a question
& answer about IMPROVISATIONS, perhaps I can get it together to post
to the list..or somebody's blog if anyone is interested.

Personal Atlas


Moon: the lighted hall of a bell.

Down on the slopes, the cows brilliant as ants
Move in the floated grass.
Listen, their warm bells.

This, after the seas -
The racket of rocks on rocks,
Or vessels spilling anvils.
No longer the old ships,
Their whale hulls.

On imaginary voyages through races,
Through odysseys of ashes I have been
And calendars of stars:
Nations - their moss, their twigs,
Their men and histories,
Their tower-making of piled boughs.

By the low, waving sea they drove their axes;
In groves, with bees warming the air.
Then all the swarmed leaves came down about them,
And they stopped for the saws of wind;
And the morning came,
And it showed in the East like a shell,
And they knew they had thorns of eyes
And feet of trees.

Or raising buildings out of stone and eyes,
Wait in the narrow pass:

The night breaks walls,
Its granite crumbs leaking,
And the hero descends -
Hacking thorugh space like a buzz saw.

Turn, turn to the night,
Though cities are shaking in water,
Though nations be knots of birds:

To the pound of light on these knolls,
The alternate stars,
And the cows - their island stopping,
Their backs like moon-maps.

    For instance, when two members of the U.S. Olympic team raised their
    fists when presented their awards [1968 in Mexico City], I was all
    excited and hooted and hollered, whereas my uncles were offended.

    massacre of Mexican students just weeks earlier.


An Interview with Anarchist and Political Prisoner Rob los Ricos
By: Marlena Gangi

Chicano anarchist Rob los Ricos is currently incarcerated and is serving
his 7th and last year of imprisonment in the Mill Creek Corrections
Facility in Salem, Oregon. He is due for release in June of 2006. In
June of 1999, Rob was arrested and charged with Assault I, Assault II
and Riot. His crime? Throwing a rock at and hitting a Eugene, Oregon
police sergeant (well, wouldn't you?) who came charging at him with
pepper spray and baton at a Reclaim the Streets protest. Rob was chased
down, thrown to the asphalt (an action that broke his nose), beaten,
pepper sprayed, handcuffed and taken into the custody of the state. This
interview, confined to an exchange of letters, follows below.

MG- Can you talk a little bit about your early life and how your
experience shaped your socio-political consciousness?

RlR- I grew up in the Texas panhandle where nothing much ever happens.
It wasn't so much personal experiences as it was events on TV that made
me aware of happenings in the big, wide world.

Some of the earliest memories related to TV were watching the Beatles on
the Ed Sullivan Show and President Kennedy's funeral. I also remember
seeing police assaults on civil rights marches and riots. Those accounts
were difficult to comprehend (I was all of 4 or 5), but I was serious
about what was happening. So I was excited to start school, as I was
certain that learning to read would help me figure things out.

One thing that I keep forgetting is how much I relate to Black people. I
was called "nigga" a lot by the redneck kids—a sure sign of imminent,
violent hostility. I admired Black people for standing up for their
rights. Most of the men in my life—my stepfather, my mother's
brothers—were racists, though. I found that difficult to understand in
my mother's Chicano family. For instance, when two members of the U.S.
Olympic team raised their fists when presented their awards [1968 in
Mexico City], I was all excited and hooted and hollered, whereas my
uncles were offended. To this day, I can't believe that [the Black
Olympians] were stripped of their medals. In the weeks before the
Olympics in Mexico City, thousands of Mexican students took to the
streets to demand social and political reform and the Mexican government
set the Army on them. Hundreds, maybe thousands, were killed. So, the
Black athletes were not just giving a "Black Power salute," they were
also remembering the massacre of Mexican students just weeks earlier.

Lot's of things happened in my early school years—MLK's, Malcolm X's and
RFK's assassinations, lot's more riots, anti-war protests, rock 'n'
roll, the sexual revolution. All of that was a blur in my mind, but I
was enthusiastic about embracing the changes.

Muhammad Ali's refusal to enter the military really blew my mind. "No
Vietnamese ever called me nigga," he explained. That helped me overcome
my naïve patriotism. I'd assumed the Vietnamese were the "bad guys." The
other nail in the coffin of my patriotism was the Tet Offensive. The
military had been saying for a year that a) we were winning the war in
Vietnam and, 2) the war would soon be over. The people of Vietnam proved
the U.S. military brass to be both incompetent and liars. Before going
any further, just let me say that the anti-war marches did not end that
conflict—the Vietnamese won.
End of story.

So…by the time I was 11, I considered myself to be a revolutionary.

MG- What was the catalyst that steered you toward anarchist thought?

RlR- It was a long process that I resisted for something like 12-15 years.

Two things happened to help along those lines.

First, in order to get over Catholicism—I was going to a Catholic
school—I spent lot's of time at the city library and researched Native
American spiritual practices. Of course, the euro-centric education that
I was force fed made me feel ashamed of my Native Mexican heritage. I
read some books critical of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and also some
anthropological books on Aztec culture and began to adopt Native
American ideas about the spirit realm. Learning about the structure of
Plains Indians, particularly the Commanches—who once dominated the
region where I grew up—introduced me to the concept of anarchy as a form
of social organization. The author of the book went to great lengths to
describe its' anarchist nature.

At some point, I read the Communist Manifesto. At first, I was excited,
but the whole "dictatorship of the proletariat" thing freaked me out.
The best thing about that was that it forever inoculated me from
catching Marxism or communism.

After I dropped out of college, I began to educate myself some more and
again encountered anarchism. The books I read were generally not very
sympathetic to anarchism, and I was more interested in learning about
socialism in a broad context.

Okay—when I was young, the people I genuinely loved and admired were my
mom's sisters. We'd gather at my grandmother's house on weekends and
they'd be in the kitchen, laughing and chatting all the time. I was
charmed. All the men I knew at the time, I really didn't like. Later, I
saw articles about Weatherwomen [the militant arm of Students for a
Democratic Society] and I was convinced that I'd someday end up [in a
relationship] with a Weatherwoman.

So, in the 80's, I did. Sure, she was a diehard Leninist, but she
genuinely loved me. So much that she one day presented me with the book
"Spanish Anarchists." "Read this," she told me. "You're an anarchist,
dear."

The cool thing was that about that time, there was a virtual explosion
of books about anarchy and anarchism, many of them written by people
sympathetic to anarchism, so I started reading a lot about it and
eventually referred to myself as an anarchist, an anarchist called Rob
los Ricos [in English, los ricos translates to "the rich." Rob's
colonial name is Rob Thaxton.]

MG- How did you end up in Eugene in 1999?

RlR- I was living in the forest mountains of southern Oregon with a few
friends. One of them had an uncle who owns some undeveloped land there.
It was one of the best experiences of my life, living outdoors and very
alluring, seeing as how I'd spent most of '95 living on the beaches of
Hawaii (the big island), and was no longer comfortable in big cities or
indoors.

It's a lonely life in the mountains, so a couple of us vowed to start
spending more time in towns, just to socialize. It just happened that we
found a couple of friends who had moved to Eugene, so we just wound up
going there more often.

Since there was an anarchist gathering [scheduled there] on June 16th,
most of us decided to go down and check it out. My friends had enough
sense to leave early on the 18th, but not me.

MG- What were the circumstances that led to your arrest, what were you
charged with and how would you sum up your trial?

RlR- The cops arrived late to the "Reclaim the Streets" festival and
immediately took a combative attitude. June 19th, 1999, was the date of
the G-8 summit in Cologne, Germany. It was declared a national day of
solidarity in opposition to the economic policies of the G-8 nations and
also in solidarity of the Zapatista uprising in Mexico.

The cops issued contradictory orders, the festival participants ignored
them, then we began to wander around Eugene. At one point, we reached a
path, and we began to disperse. When the cops saw one or two people away
from the crowds, they would attack and arrest them. So, we regrouped for
our mutual safety. Then the police began to shoot tear gas at us. The
wind blew it back in their faces.

We were standing around, uncertain of what to do, when the cops began
driving their cars into the crowd, piling out and grabbing the nearest
people, pepper spraying them and arresting them. A cop was running
toward me, and I just happened to have a big rock in my hands, so I
tossed it up and it smacked him on the shoulder and broke off his radio
handset. The cop and a couple of his fellow officers chased me down,
knocked me to the ground, pepper sprayed and arrested me.

I was charged with attempted Assault I, Assault II and Riot. If found
guilty, I could have faced up to 14 ½ years on all charges, thanks
largely to Oregon's Measure 11 mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines.
That, and the judge's determination to give me all the time she could.

My trial was a mess. The court was obviously prejudiced toward the
prosecution. At least the jury had the good sense to acquit me of the
first charge. I wish that I had taken a more belligerent attitude during
my trial. At least I would have had more fun. As it was, I had to
content myself with giving the officer that I assaulted the finger when
the judge wasn't looking.

MG- Can you communicate with other political prisoners without fear of
punishment?

RlR- Many states prohibit their prisoners from sending mail from or to
other prisoners. In addition, for a long while, I was worried that
contact with me would cause other prisoners to be labeled Security
Threat Group [STG] members. Mostly, I'll only write other prisoners if
they initiate contact and understand the risk they're taking. For
prisoners with the possibility of parole, STG designation is reason
enough to be denied parole.

My Comrade Brian McCarvill and I eventually made the Oregon Department
of Corrections back off on the STG label for anarchism and anarchists.
Not that they still don't occasionally use STG rules to deny us mail.

MG- Have you been able to accomplish any significant organizing or
networking?

RlR- At first, there were some people who were interested in doing
prisoner solidarity projects. A few of us started up the Anarchist
Prisoner Legal Aid Network, but that faded over the course of years, as
people left and one person was left to do the bulk of work on the outside.

Over the past five years, I've had to consistently re-assess what I can
accomplish from here. Now I'm fairly focused on preparing for my June
2006 release and the friends and supporters who have stuck with me over
the years are helping out, to the extent that I no longer feel anxiety
about leaving prison.

MG- What has been the most painful part of this ordeal?

RlR- My daughter, Raven.

MG- What is your hope for the future?

RlR- My daughter, Raven.

MG-What has served to sustain you throughout this ordeal?

RlR-The love and support from people across the country, continent and
world. There are about two dozen people who write me regularly and have
become valued friends and comrades. Also, my daughter Raven has proven
to me that love is the greatest power on earth.

Danielle Grilli here. I would personally love to see what you and Vernon
have been posting to one another if you were up to it.

I do not profess to be an expert in visual poetry by any means.  When I
wrote the questions to Vernon, I did so more to provoke answers from him in
regards to his life, opinions and work than to categorize him myself.  I
also planned the interview to be read by a general audience, unfamiliar with
contemporary vispo.

Personally, I do think of Vernon as a forerunner of the contemporary vispo
movement.  Of course we can refer to hieroglyphics and other ancient forms
of vispo, but these are of a different linguistic make altogether. Vernon
himself has been working with text visually for many years and the manner in
which he has been doing so is quite different than the other vispo I have
seen.  I do understand that Vernon's work may not be categorized as 'vispo'
however I felt that these were hairs too fine to split for a general
audience.  Of course, movements and categorizations of any art form are
never as clear as we would perhaps like them to be.

with mIEKAL i was quite astounded to find vernon being considered a
forerunner to visual poetry. modern visual poetry is usally considered to
begin with mallarme's "Un Coup de des" written in the late 1890's.  What
Vernon does doesn't go beyond anything mallarme did, in fact mallarme may be
more extreme. Then there is Pound, for exmaple, Oslon, for exmaple and a
poet like Larry Eigner who makes use of the page in many exciting ways
visually.  Itis not splitting hairs to say Vernon is not visual poetry, itis
simply the truth.  Vernon is not a forerunner but one making use of
techniques that have been around for a bit over a century now, and have also
appeared in the past in pattern poetry centuries ago in many countries.
Some like myself feel that the ealriest visual poetry are the cave paintings
and petroglyphs;  itis generally agreed that modern visual poetry is from
mallarme, followed quickly by Italian Futurism, dada, Russian Futurism etc
etc.  I was deeply puzzled to read the statement, it shows a blithe
disregard for the work of thousands of people over the last century plus who
have worked with the visual element in their poetry, not to mention visual
poetry itself.
It is unfair to the general reader to be misleading. I was suprised Vernon
concurred with the statement as he shows ijn his work his debt to writers
like Oslon  and Olson made full use of the visual in his layouts and
spacings. I am gald Venron's work is receiving such good attention, but
don't go overboard in claiming it as a forerunner, when it seems to me one
of the strengths of the work is the way it makes use of a variety of models
from various approaches to poetry. That is, it is not a forerunner, but a
work built on what has precded it and an effort to take these in the poet's
own vision into new places of his creation.

I don't consider Vernon's work vispo either, though this is hardly the
uncontroversial statement that you paint it as. Have you looked at the
final 200 pages of IMPROVISATIONS yet? Comparisons to Mallarme, Pound,
or Olson are pretty limited.

Obviously, every "forerunner" works on what's been done in the past. We
make certain assumptions, with language. When writing for a general
audience, it is not necessary to explain that modern visual poets are
decended from Neanderthals. People who are not poets consider that
obvious. IMPROVISATIONS is a very strong departure from vispo, futurism
and dada. It's a forerunner of something.

Come to a Homewrecker reading!  Polish your transparent excuses, your sad self-
justifications!

The writers in Homewrecker: an Adultery Reader are reading as part of its launch in NYC.
There’s these fabulous writers: Susannah Breslin, Christine Hamm, Thomas Hopkins, Marty
McConnell, and Felicia Sullivan.  Finally, Daphne Gottlieb, the woman who pasted this

the improviser becomes the improvisation
mIEKAL aND Begins to Question Vernon Frazer
(This first set of questions were exchanged via email July 2005)

Vernon Frazer:

I began the poem as a free improvisation, not knowing where it would
lead. At some point in the process, I realized it would incorporate
visual elements, but I didn't know exactly what they would be or when
they would appear. Since the poem was written in the moment, its
seriality lies in the way the poem's energy moves from one moment to
the next. The voice of the narrator, so to speak, becomes "Voice." It
manifests itself as more than one voice because the text is an
orchestration of language.I like to think that when the poem goes out
of seriality, and becomes the moment expressed as the moment, the
improviser becomes the improvisation.

Subject:      MLA 2006 call for papers: The Place of Place in Contemporary
              Experimental Poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Here's a call for papers for the 2006 MLA in Philadelphia:

In order to imagine a place
must we inhabit it?

and by inhabiting, raze the imagination
that made it?

Catherine Kasper (1)

If experimental poets often seek to empty conceptual categories, including
constructions of place, how, then, is the lived experience of place
represented in their work? According to geographer Miles Richardson, place
is "both grounded in the physical world and . . . lodged in the world of
symbolic discourse," "something fixed and
fleeting, something you can walk on and something you can speak" (2). The
notion of a dialogue between the two realms of groundedness and symbolic
expression may provide an entrance to the consideration of the place of
place in contemporary experimental poetry, in which the
destabilization of social constructions, nostalgic idealisms, and
mythologizing is in dialogue with the acknowledgement of lived experience
in the here and now.

This panel will explore issues of place in particular contemporary
experimental poets. Theoretical explorations might include (but are not
limited to) recent writings on place in social anthropology and cultural
geography, such as the work of Miles Richardson, Margaret Rodman, J.
Nicholas Entrikin, Yi-Fu Tuan, and Arjun Appadurai.

Please email a 400- to 500-word proposal with a brief cv by March 25, 2006,
to c8martin@ryerson.ca

The 2006 MLA Convention will be in Philadelphia, December 27-30.

"Dance a clean dream and an extravagant turn up,
secure the steady rights
                and translate more than translate the authority, show
the choice and make no

--Gertrude Stein

The Misbehaving Poem

In this course we will abandon many of our preconceptions about the =
proper
poem.
By reading and discussing some contemporary poems and by attempting some =

exercises,  we will try to discover ways to undermine and disrupt =
notions
such as logic,  linearity  and seriousness.  We'll look at poems whose
misconduct is engaging and enlightening by poets such as James Tate,
Harryette Mullen, Amy Gerstler, John Ashbery, Catherine Bowman, Mark =
Levine,
Lois Ann Yamanaka,  some French surrealists, and others.

In case you missed this in the morning NY Times (more amplified in the
current new issue of the New Yorker), this revelation of permission to
torture (Abu Graib), violated International Law,  et al  puts the finger
right on Rumsfeld and Bush (and not on the advice of their senior,
professional Government lawyers).
Makes it all very nice to have Roberts and Alito as Bush appointments to th=
e
White House. Boy, are those guys going to come in handy, if these crimes of
torture get into the domestic court system. But this stuff may will go
straight to the Hague and we will be able to witness (lots of luck) Rumsfel=
d
do a poetic courtroom parody of Milosevic ("Goodness gracious, we would
never do a thing like that. With all due respect, prosecutors, you have it
flat wrong. These were the bad guys and these - what you call torture - wer=
e
skills as we all learned when I was a college wrestler." etc.
Take heed, take heed!


Senior Lawyer at Pentagon Broke Ranks on Detainees

By TIM GOLDEN
Published: February 20, 2006

One of the Pentagon's top civilian lawyers repeatedly challenged the Bush
administration's policy on the coercive interrogation of terror suspects,
arguing that such practices violated the law, verged on torture and could
ultimately expose senior officials to prosecution, a newly disclosed
document shows.

The lawyer, Alberto J. Mora, a political appointee who retired Dec. 31 afte=
r
more than four years as general counsel of the Navy, was one of many
dissenters inside the Pentagon. Senior uniformed lawyers in all the militar=
y
services also objected sharply to the interrogation policy, according to
internal documents declassified last year.

But Mr. Mora's campaign against what he viewed as an official policy of
cruel treatment, detailed in a memorandum he wrote in July 2004 and
recounted in an article in the Feb. 27 issue of The New Yorker magazine,
made public yesterday, underscored again how contrary views were often
brushed aside in administration debates on the subject.

"Even if one wanted to authorize the U.S. military to conduct coercive
interrogations, as was the case in Guant=E1namo, how could one do so without
profoundly altering its core values and character?" Mr. Mora asked the
Pentagon's chief lawyer, William J. Haynes II, according to the memorandum.

A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Tracy O'Grady-Walsh, declined to comment
late yesterday on specific assertions in Mr. Mora's memorandum. "Detainee
operations and interrogation policies have been scrutinized under a
microscope, from all different angles," she said. "It was found that it was
not a Department of Defense policy to encourage or condone torture."

In interviews, current and former Defense Department officials said that
part of what was striking about Mr. Mora's forceful role in the internal
debates was how out of character it seemed: a loyal Republican, he was know=
n
as a supporter of President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and
the fight against terrorism.

"He's an extremely well-spoken, almost elegant guy," the former director of
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, David L. Brandt, who first came t=
o
Mr. Mora with concerns about the interrogation methods, said in an intervie=
w
last week. "He's not a door-kicker."

Mr. Mora is also known for generally avoiding public attention. Reached by
telephone yesterday, he declined to comment further on his memorandum.

Mr. Mora prepared the 22-page memorandum for a Defense Department review of
interrogation operations that was conducted by Vice Adm. Albert T. Church
III, after the scandal involving treatment of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib
prison in Iraq.

The document focused on Mr. Mora's successful opposition to the coercive
techniques that Mr. Rumsfeld approved for interrogators at Guant=E1namo Bay o=
n
Dec. 2, 2002, and Mr. Mora's subsequent, failed effort to influence the
legal discussions that led to new methods approved by Mr. Rumsfeld the
following April.

Mr. Mora took up the issue after Mr. Brandt came to him on Dec. 17, 2002, t=
o
relay the concerns of Navy criminal agents at Guant=E1namo that some detainee=
s
there were being subjected to "physical abuse and degrading treatment" by
interrogators.

Acting with the support of Gordon R. England, who was then secretary of the
Navy and is now Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy, Mr. Mora took his concerns to Mr.
Haynes, the Defense Department's general counsel.

"In my view, some of the authorized interrogation techniques could rise to
the level of torture, although the intent surely had not been to do so," Mr=
.
Mora wrote.=20

After trying to rally other senior officials to his position, Mr. Mora met
again with Mr. Haynes on Jan. 10, 2003. He argued his case even more
forcefully, raising the possibility that senior officials could be
prosecuted for authorizing abusive conduct, and asking: "Had we jettisoned
our human rights policies?"

Still, Mr. Mora wrote, it was only when he warned Mr. Haynes on Jan. 15 tha=
t
he was planning to issue a formal memorandum on his opposition to the
methods =8B delivering a draft to Mr. Haynes's office =8B that Mr. Rumsfeld
suddenly retracted the techniques.

In a break from standard practice, former Pentagon lawyers said, the final
draft of the report on interrogation techniques was not circulated to most
of the lawyers, including Mr. Mora, who had contributed to it. Several of
them said they learned that a final version had been issued only after the
Abu Ghraib scandal broke.

David,

My knowledge of Vernon's work is confined to the reading he gave at The Poetry Project last year. The strongest memory of this reading for me was its carefulness. Everything was set up and read carefully. At least in one instance a second person was brought in for a poem which I assume appeared as two columns on the page. There were no surprises.

Introducing a specific poem, Vernon said that the piece was written on the spur of the moment, spontaneously (I am paraphrasing). At that moment I and my friend sitting next to me turned to each other and said, "but that's what improvisation is"; a quality Vernon was claiming for the whole book.

I was all ready to buy a copy of "Improvisations," but after the reading I changed my mind. For me visual/improvisatory texts lead to a crisis in reading. Undercutting the settled sequencing a traditional text presents, in a visual/improvisatory text, the reader/performer is forced to make choices of word (phrase) sequencing, which each time may be different, therefore, the improvisatory openness of a performance. For instance, if a page contains two parallel columns, the solution is not to have two people read it, but the performer must go through a process of choices. This tense process of inclusion/exclusion is the body of the poem at that instant.
 (occasion).

It seems to me, at least in our day, a visual poem can not exist without the possibility of a phantom performance attached to it.

Murat

Just managed to pick up this Green Integer (#51) published in 2000.
Just lovely, the absolute kind of clarity one deeply appreciates,
particularly on this particular President's Presidents day. Or as Mr.
Grenier succinctly puts it in the backword:
 ...It is where the species may go with Language through Stream of Time -
towards engagement with strange/holy fact of what' ('always')happening ("how
or why" as he wonders it) before you.  Like Emily Dickinson's, it's an
'example' for all of us 'regular Americans' how to think/see/feel/move.

Definitely a man/eye who could apprehend the whole, elusive quail.

I would like collect examples of words that are untranslatable and
provide a web-based publishing outlet for them to be found.

I am most interested in single words (lacuna) which require phrases,
paragraphs, or pages of explanation to try and give a reasonable
approximation of their full meaning, but am open to considering
anything at all (really, try me) that fits (or answers to, or responds
to) the notion of untranslatability.

When submitting, please include:

1) the native language the word (or phrase) appears in

2) the target language(s) into which it is known to be untranslatable

3) as much explanation as you feel is necessary to communicate the
   full meaning of the word, possibly using a standard dictionary
   attempt which fails miserably as a starting point (or not, as you
   see fit)

or, for submissions that don't fit this idealized set of guidelines, a
brief note explaining your submission's connection to the concept of
untranslatability.

Submissions can be as casual or scholarly as your experience dictates,
the format I'm planning will allow multiple approaches to the same
translation challenge.

Please address submissions to your favorite word, whatever that may
be, at logolalia.com.

When I have a few solid examples to launch with, I'll announce that
it's ready for viewing. When that times comes, the URL will be (but is
not yet) http://www.logolalia.com/untranslatable/

Please circulate this call as widely as possible, to anyone in any
country or field of endeavor who might have examples to share. This is
an open an ongoing call. I will attempt to accommodate all native and
target languages to the best of my abilities.

last night I finally saw Transamerica.  Some funny little moments, all
cushioned in a travel trope of a ultra- fem transitioning to fem-hood.
 And though there was some funny cute moments, I was very aware of how
often they portrayed this "passing" individual living in fear,
internalized dread, panic, horror, and desperation.

The war is here folks and until we can address the war on bodies here,
we all have little chance of addressing the empire building monster
that has it claws everywhere,  in our bodies and  in our minds.

please if you have not seen this movie, see it...

realize it is only minute select composted edited out moments, made to
make it an easy to handle projection of a relativity easy transition
transition...

Not the difficult ones, where the suicide is successful, or the rape
is real, or the murder unpunished.... or the masses in India or
Thailand herded into prostitution, denied education and other basic
rights, or other places that is worse...

please see this film and if you have already seen it, go back and
count the times this person lives in fear... and know it is only a
hint of the fear most gender queer folks live in...

this is not a paid advertisement... this is a plea...

thank you

Subject:      Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I've encountered many poetics pedagogues, but the bottom line is always
subjective. We enjoy what moves us, not what we think should move us. What  does
Vernon's work do to me or anyone else who actually  reads it? IMPROVISATIONS,
as a narrative of self, other, and being,  seems to be meant more for reading
than hearing. If you're familiar  with his voice, however, you can hear him
reading it to you. But, in which  order, and with whom? That is the point. Is he
speaking in an unknown  language, using words that we only thought we
understood?  I  get caught up in his gentle grip, questioning everything, loving the
ambiguity and the absurdity.

Projective verse and philosophy of language are a natural fit, and when he
so utterly and fearlessly puts forth, he IS a forerunner. Not a forerunner  of
any particular post-modern literature, but as an example of how he,
individually, approaches the quagmire of "meaning" in a poetic form.  His essence and
existence continually outrun one another for primacy. Has  language become a
forerunner of meaning? Which style, which medium, font,  form or technology is
relevant?

Frazer holds interesting and provocative words as shades of  color. What does
color mean?His life experience has been deeply  contemplated. When he begins
to paint with his words, like say Jackson  Pollock, he runs ahead of himself,
or is that alongside himself? Words  are subliminally brought forth from the
living museum of his own unique mind. So  which comes first? What is essence or
existence? Is there potential wholeness of  being? Are any categories, or
even relevant questions? Does the  manifestation of any collection of words and
images have to mean anything at all  to anyone? What is the point of
communication through art? Is a human being  anything other than an instrument of
expression? Expression of what?

For me life as art (or art as life, life as life, or art as art)  is the body
expressing a mind full of words and images, provided by  others and projected
back into the world of others, each of whom has a mind  full of other words
and images. Connections are rare and transitory. We  behold individual bodies,
but we refuse to accept that individual minds are  entangled in those
individual bodies. We hope we can communicate ideas as if  they could transubstantiate
into water, earth, air and fire. It only seems that  words can take us out of
our bodies, into an imagined place of collective  understanding. When words
become as substantial as the body from which they're  uttered, well then, I
might believe anything is possible. Strange  though, words do sustain me from
time to time, almost as if they are bread  and roses.

For me, Vernon's work is the improvisation of his life. Many  poets are
afraid to improvise, afraid to reveal themselves to themselves, let  alone to the
world. Many poets simply dabble. I feel that in the short span of  one's
existence, one doesn't have time to dabble. And, it should be obvious from  the way
I think, write, and reveal myself, why I treasure Vernon's work. I  hope that
doesn't discourage anyone from reading it for  themselves!

hello folks....

blue lion books is happy to announce two new
titles, John M Bennett's 'la M al' and 'Proletariaria
vol 1 and vol 2'

synopses of the books are below:

please order from http://www.cafepress.com/bluelionbooks66



Proletariaria Vol. 1, Kevin Magee
282 pp, 5" x 8", isbn 952-99632-9-7, $19.46

Beginning by inflecting the memory of the Pisan Cantos and
the Berliner Ensemble, the primary opposition of the early post-
war period, the first volume of Proletariaria presents work
written between 1995-1999, representing a range of forms
and voices committed to the proposition that nothing is
finished, no tendency has been closed, and history remains
open, waiting to be re-made.  The prevalent mode of Volume 1
interprets expressionism as making available a destabilized
lyric subject saturated with imagination-as-experience, where
interiority of reference and perception coincides with such
objectifying influences as the transcriptive tracings of working-
class voices in Reznikoff's Testimony.


Proletariaria Vol. 2, Kevin Magee
460 pp, 5" x 8", isbn 952-99632-8-9, $24.80

The second volume of Proletariaria, presenting work written
between 1999 and 2001, sets out by stating the letter "B" as
postscript and descendant of Zukofsky's "A"-8.  This initial,
generative identification expands across various trajectories,
among them a hacked Western/Central European lexical index
re-mixed by way of the archive fever of Prighov's futurism,
Stein-like percussion from the shopfloor of a Cleveland factory,
online hot-swapping of virtual identities, a serial meditation
on the traditional media of poetry and painting and their con-
ceptual affinities, and close attention to marginalized voices
and experiences crossing and cross-dressing racial and gender
boundaries. The signage of Volumes 1 and 2 of Proletariaria
might be said to belong to the multiple or composite signature,
where intertextuality and street-sound recordings combine
to reverberate previous acts of authoring in a projective effort
to open instead of close the past.

Amadou Diallo: His Life and Death in Art

Exhibit opens this Saturday Feb 4, 2006 3:30pm

Casa Frela Gallery
47 W. 119th St. (Between Lenox & Madison)

The exhibit will run thru Feb 28, 2006

Casa Frela Gallery is honored to remember
Amadou Bialo Diallo
(September 2, 1975-February 4, 1999)

"Two hundred and thirty-one years later, 41 shots were heard 'round
the World. Not for the birth of a new nation, but for the killing of a
young man. The World had forgotâ€”"so costly a sacrifice upon the altar
of freedom". And, at this moment we feel the absence of hope. A son
had died, not on a field of battle, but on the steps of his home." LR


Casa Frela Gallery celebrates the life of Amadou Diallo with an art
exhibition of paintings and photography. The exhibition commemorates
the seventh anniversary of the death of Diallo on February 4, 1999, as
a result of police brutality stemming from racial profiling. Ten
artists have created ten paintings about Diallo's life, death, and
contributions. Featured artists like Eric Alugas, Shawn Walker,
Katrina Jeffries and many more. Photographer Jim Carroll has
contributed 20 poignant photographs of Amadou Diallo's funeral
procession.

The exhibition runs at Casa Frela from Saturday, February 4th through
Tuesday, February 28th.

Please join us for the opening reception on Saturday, February 4th from
3-8pm.

Praefatio by the author; Introductio by Dale Smith; Cauda by Gongora
(adapted from Plautus)

"Thanks for sending me the epigrams.* Superb. It's about time for
something of the sort, I'd say, what with the ass licking that rules the
day. Especially the ass-licking that some ass-lickers want to pass off
as "avant-garde confrontation." My salute... And as to your question,
well, yeah, absolutely: Olson, if he'd lived to see what has happened,
would have loved these."
--Ed Dorn
* from a response by Dorn to a batch of the first epigrams, sent to him
in early 1999.

Shihan "the Prototype"



A Lower East Side of New York City native, Shihan began his writing
career in 1989, when he received a full scholarship to the Williston
North Hampton School in Massachusetts for creative writing. In 1993,
Shihan was signed to MCA Records as an artist/writer. Shihan went on to
write for the NBA Jam Session series as well as creating the theme for
Reebok's ' Blacktop' campaign. Shihan has found work writing for the
very popular Schoolhouse Rocks compilation series. Also, co-writing one
of MTV's most popular Rock The Vote campaigns ' Tic Toc.'

Shihan was a member of the 2004 National Poetry Slam Championship Team,
and also earned Grand Champion titles at the 2001 Los Angeles Finals and
the 2000 Hollywood Finals. Shihan was a core poet on the Grand Marnier
sponsored Slamamerica Bus Tour which toured 30 cities in 30 days. He's
been featured throughout the United States including the 2000 Tony
Awards after show in NYC and the #1 rated show on Oprah's Oxygen Media '
As She Sees It.' Shihan has been featured all five seasons on Russell
Simmons presents Def Poetry and also serves as Talent Coordinator for

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Cirque de Soleil. Shihan lent his
spoken word talents to soft drink giant Pepsi for their 'Slam' national
television and radio campaigns, which he co-wrote. Shihan also toured
the country as the 'Street Poet' for the Nike Battlegrounds One-on-One

Jaha Zainabu



The rhymes? The lines? The rhapsody? Yes, but there is so much more.
It's the message. Jaha Zainabu is a poet, spoken word artist, visual
artist and motivational speaker from Long Beach, California who uses her
art to educate, inspire, entertain and heal. She performs in many
performance galleries from The World Stage in Los Angeles to The
Nuyorician Poets Cafe in New York and many other venues. She is a member
of the Anansi Writers Workshop in Los Angeles and was a member of the
2001 Los Angeles Slam Team.

Her words enhearten others to go within themselves and find their unique
gift, nurture it and allow that gift to bless the self and the world.
Jaha has produced a poetry show called "Journey" which began July 2000
in Los Angeles. She has a collection of written poetry and a cd also
called "Journey." Some of her topics include motherhood, womanhood,
African-American experiences, male-female relationships, her
relationship with God, and other issues. She gives credit to the Creator
as her source and beleives that we are connected by the same source and
encourages others to keep the light shinning.

Jaha's newest book is entitled "The Science of Chocolate Milk Making."

L.I.F.E.



Intense!

The best, one word description for the passionate and powerful spoken
word artist L.I.F.E.

Since 2001, he has blazed stages from London to D.C., educating and
electrifying audiences with lucid, hard-hitting performance poetry that
leaves you craving more no matter how much he gives.

Winning the USF sponsored 2004/2005 Black Heritage Festival Poetry Slam,
the 2005 Louder Than Words poetry slam and the Underground Poets
King/Queen of the Bay Slam in Tampa, the 2005 Akoben Festival/Word Up! V
slam in Norfolk, along with winning numerous smaller slams over the
course of his young spoken word career, is a testament to the way
L.I.F.E so powerfully and effectively conveys his passion and pain to
listeners.

Three stellar perfomances in "HEAT", a fluid, ensemble poetry showcase
featuring wordsmyths on the bleeding edge of the current spoken word
movement, earned him an honor shared with no other poet on the planet,
the only permanent spot in the production.

L.I.F.E. has recorded two spoken word CDs ,"XpoZin' Maself", his latest,
and his first, "forthepeople".

L.I.F.E. opperates one of the longest running weekly open mic venues in
Florida and the largest in his home city, Black On Black Rhyme, in
Tampa.

GINA LORING



With a rich, soulful voice, thought provoking lyrics, and a powerful
stage presence, Gina Loring is in a league of her own. The top ranking
female poet at the 2002 National Poetry Slam, she was featured on two
seasons of HBO's Russell Simmons' Def Poetry. Following several
showcases produced by Norman Lear, she was hired as a writer/ performer
on the "Declare Yourself" tour. As a non partisan, non profit voter
registration campaign, the "Declare Yourself" project implemented spoken
word and hip hop as a call to action, performing at the DNC, People for
the American Way events, and dozens of Colleges, Universities, film and
music festivals nation wide. In conjunction with Diddy's "Vote or Die"
campaign and Rock the Vote, Gina helped to register thousands of young
voters. She was also a featured vocalist/songwriter on the Brand New
Heavies new album "We Won't Stop" and has been mentored by such artists
as Randy Jackson and Marla Gibbs.

A graduate of Spelman College, Gina performed with their award-winning
Jazz Ensemble, Glee Club and Theater Ensemble and also attended Columbia
University, where she studied under renowned Hip Hop historian Michael
Eric Dyson. A gifted actress, Gina starred in a production of George C.
Wolfe's "The Colored Museum" and various theatrical shorts during her
time in the Atlanta/ Tri-State areas. A member of Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority, Inc., Gina would like to follow in the footsteps of such
pioneers as Ruby Dee and Lena Horne in positively contributing through
her art.

With musical influences ranging from classic Hip Hop to Nina Simone, her
highly reflective lyrics demonstrate her ability to reveal the intimate.
Encompassing such subjects as love, spirituality and social activism,
her work is raw and passionate, yet always presented with the grace that
seems inherent in this young woman's spirit. She is the daughter of
actor William Marshall, cousin of actor Paul Winfield and Jazz
composer/musician Teddy Edwards Sr., and she would like to dedicate her
work to their memory.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Announcing: A 48th Birthday Celebration for Michel
Houellebecq, Sunday, Feb. 26, 4pm, Rust Belt Books.

On the basis of three novels and a critical study of
H. P. Lovecraft,
Michel Houellebecq has already achieved a type of cult
status in the United States.  The French author is
controversial, to be sure: his frank and complicated
treatments of sex and his sometimes incendiary
representations of Islam, particularly in his two best
novels (translated in the US as The Elementary
Particles and Platform) have seen him both praised for
his novelistic bravery and denounced as an
inflammatory agitator.  But he is also seen by many as
one of the world's most important writers (as
evidenced by a recent cover article in Book Forum) and
perhaps the most important novelist France has
produced since the days of the Nouveau Roman.

Our celebration of M. Houellebecq's 48th birthday is
meant as a rather
tongue-in-cheek effort (one can hardly imagine the
famously cynical Houellebecq attending such a thing
himself -- except to get the at the PLENTIFUL
WINE THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE) to popularize the
novelist and celebrate his work as a revitalizing of
the novel form.  Starcherone Books, as an educational
organization dedicated to promoting and popularizing
experiments in literary fiction, will offer several
readers of Houellebecq's works (tentatively to include
Ted Pelton, Ethan Paquin, Isabelle Pellissier, and Ed
Taylor), as well as leading a discussion of themes in
his work and Houellebecq's overall importance.

This event is sponsored by Starcherone Books with the
assistance of the Melodia E. Jones Chair of French at
University at Buffalo and Medaille College.

Get prepared!  Start reading Houellebecq today!  Here
is a Michel Houellebecq site.  It's in French, but
there is a link to get an English version.

http://membres.lycos.fr/houellebecq/

See you all on the 26th!  A bientot!

Subject:      call it a warehouse sale:
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I just got a couple of boxes of my two publications from Windsor,
Ontario's Black Moss Press, and until the end of March (2006), am offering
them at a discount. $10 each if you see me (maybe at my TREE Reading on
March 14th?), or $13 each if you want them mailed (outside Canada, $13 US).

The first is my eighth poetry collection, red earth (Black Moss Press,
2003). This is what poet and critic Harold Rhenisch was nice enough to say
about it in Ottawa's own Arc magazine:

"What sets it apart [] is not its reliance on travel, imagery, and its
civic sense of poetry, but that it gets its kick of this Bank Street roast
straight from the source, from Whitman, Stein, and Kerouac, and from
George Bowering, King of TISH. mclennan is better than the lot, a kind of
Canadian Robert Creeley, presenting us with moments to move into, like
museum dioramas, incomplete until we stand in them. In mclennan, a whole
tradition that has been underground in Canada for almost half a century
has found a new champion."

The second is an anthology I edited, evergreen: six new poets (Black Moss
Press, 2002), featuring the work of six poets who hadn't published full
trade collections yet (but for one contributor), including Laurie Fuhr
(then, Ottawa; now Calgary), Jon Paul Fiorentino (Montreal), Meghan
Jackson (outside of Toronto; watch for her first collection out this fall
with Ottawa's Chaudiere Books), Andy Weaver (Edmonton), Susan Elmslie
(Montreal; watch for her first collection this year with Brick Books) and
ryan fitzpatrick (Calgary).

As usual, make all cheques payable to rob mclennan c/o 858 Somerset Street
West, main floor, Ottawa Ontario Canada K1R 6R7

Well, I have been in some big drinking bars where, out on the patio, they do
keep a number of what are called  "porto-potatory-potties" just to be able
to handle all the pees.
Out in your midwest, Miekal, this time of year, temperatures under zero,
etc., I would suspect that kind of architecture - even in the case of great
need -  is not too common (??).

Hello, hello--

We, at Kundiman, are pleased to announce the call for application for th=
e
2006 Vincent Chin Memorial Chapbook Prize.

Please forward widely.

Best,
Sarah


***************************************************************

The Vincent Chin Memorial Chapbook Prize
Deadline:  June 30, 2006

On June 19, 1982, in Detroit, Vincent Chin was beaten to death with a
baseball bat by a man and his stepson. The two laid-off autoworkers
mistook Chin for Japanese =97 an Asian group they blamed for the ailing =
U.S.
auto industry. The assailants never served jail time, and later federal
civil-rights courts acquitted them entirely of the crime.

For many today, this is a rarely remembered footnote in American history=
.
However, the tragedy of Vincent Chin marked an important change in how
Asian Americans viewed themselves. It was the first time, according to A=
PA
advocates and academics, that people who traced their ancestry to
different countries in Asia and the Pacific Islands crossed ethnic and
socioeconomic lines to fight [politically] as a united group of Asian
Pacific Americans. They were Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino; th=
ey
were waiters, lawyers, and grandmothers who were moved to action by what=

happened to Vincent Chin.

For the first time, Asian Americans banded together against the
discrimination and racism directed toward the APA community.  Decades
later, the need for Asian Americans to unite as a population and to
project a voice into the cultural mainstream is as urgent as ever.

In honor of Vincent Chin and this watershed moment in Asian American
history, Kundiman and Barrow Street are sponsoring The Vincent Chin
Memorial Chapbook Prize. This annual prize is an opportunity for both
Kundiman and Barrow Street to support and spotlight the talent of an
emerging Asian American poet, a new voice in the landscape of Asian
American expression and power.

Winner will receive:
=95        $500 cash prize
=95        Chapbook publication in Barrow Street:
http://www.barrowstreet.org/journal.html
=95        Full scholarship to the 2007 Kundiman Summer Retreat

Applicant Eligibility
Asian American poets who have not published more than one book of
forty-eight pages or more.

Entry Fee
Check for $15.00 payable to The New York Foundation for the Arts

Judge
John Yau will judge this year=92s contest.

bios:

*Robert Kerr=20

He is a playwright and occasional songwriter originally from Minnesota who
now lives in Brooklyn.  His plays have been produced in New York City,
Minneapolis, Chicago, and Florida.

*Matt Lydon

I moved to New York City in the fall of 2002 one month after getting
married. When my best friend heard I was moving, he asked me to be in his
band. So I started playing bass in the Old Flames, but mostly we just
practiced and played parties. Three shows at the Bowery Poetry Club later,
the band died a slow but not so painful death. I began performing by myself
at the open mics. Now I sing and play my guitar, sometimes with other
people, but mainly by myself.

*Old Hat

Old Hat is a group of friends that gather for the opportunity play a song o=
n
occasion. One evening Deenah crashed a rehearsal that Dibs, Betsy, and
Preston were having and all of a sudden we had our own song.
Then while performing we found Dan playing percussion for us. It=B9s a group
that formed out of whatever was present at the time, so the instrumentation
is not quite set, sometimes autoharps guitars and ukuleles make appearances=
.
Either way, everyone gets to sing along.

*Prewar Yardsale

Prewar Yardsale is Dina Levy and Mike Rechner and their new son Harmon
Gillespie Levy Rechner. Harmon writes the songs, while Dina and Mike sing
and perform them on bucket, tin can, and guitar.

We are singing a happy song because we have a new CD =B3We are Singing a Sad
Song=B2. =B3We are Singing a Sad Song=B2 is our 2nd full length CD with Olive
Juice Music, produced by Major Matt Mason USA. We are currently recording a
split 12=B2 with Huggabroomstik at Care-A-Lot Studios, and we have a song on
the new UK CD =B3Wild, Wild West, Smoking Gun Compilation=B2.

*The Baby Skins

Named after a mysterious concoction developed by NYC songsmith Paleface, th=
e
Baby Skins are a musical duo that formed in the last quarter of 2001.
Collaborators Crystal Madrilejos and Angela Carlucci take the stage proudly
displaying their many badges of honor and sometimes black knit ski masks.
The two share guitar and xylophone duties while weaving in and out of
haunting vocal harmonies. Their acoustic folk songs deal with unrequited
love, forbidden love, betrayal, friendship and magical babies which excrete
white fecal matter. Their live show will leave you twitching and emaciated
in their rainbow - coloured sparkly shadow.

Hello,

I've started work on a chapbook review column that will appear regularly in
Rain Taxi. I'm writing this note to solicit any review copies folks might
like to punt over to me, although I'm not really looking for anything
published before 2005. If you plan on releasing any chapbooks in the future,
please keep me in mind, but know I will not be able to review most of the
work received. Here is a link to a sample of my older chapbook reviews:

Hey, just wanted to mention, an interview with Garin Cycholl , the second part clarifying his interest in Olson, the dynamics of place and use of history in poems
  will be  the focus of our next mass e-mailing on thursday. If you are not on the listserve for  Pavement Saw let me know back channel. After that will be an e-zine focusing on the various  death threats, crappy letters and other material recieved in the mail box recently. Should be fun & let you know what kind of nonsense a large poetry press has to deal with onb a regular basis.

  Pierre, send me your address, I have something to send you I've been  meaning to, of interest. Also, have student interested in Paul Blackburn 6 PACK,  do you still have copies?

 Kazim, I owe you a note at least, we love you! & your book The Far Mosque, which deserves far more recognition than I have seen here so far in the midwest, I highly recommend, but send me a note when able & phone number, & we will talk--



Be well

"I wore this carefreeness for several weeks.  It had
settled on me like
the dust blowing in from the desert of which i was
scarcely aware
until I found myself writing my name with my finger in
the dust.
   The inventories of dust...the swift strokes of the
straw broom
as it swept the earth...the clay into which reached
the tomato
plants...pounding of clay into pot or brick...careful
rich
deposits...yucca perched on shale...a car moving from
grass
to pavement...its tires heating or cooling the
cement...sand
on my leg...sand filed against my ankle...sand resting
on tile
...the weight of tile...heavy here...thin over
there...
bird's beak pushing the cracks filled with
bread...perishable
only the mountains...venturing into haze."

Thursday, March 9 at 8pm at Bouldin Creek Cafe

During the AWP Convention, I will be hosting a reading.  If you are
going to be in Austin and are interested in reading, there is still room
for more.  Contact me backchannel asap.

More information on the venue, including a map and directions, can be
found at http://www.bouldincreek.com/index.htm.  The cafe is due south
of downtown Austin in the low-key hipster "So Co" neighborhood.  The
mood will be casual (duh, it's Austin).  By the way, the cafe serves
food and beer in addition to great coffee.

Please contact me with any questions.  Thanks for your interest and I
look forward to meeting all of you and hearing your work.

Best,

Grant

If anyone is reading at AWP or is organizing or knows of readings outside
the program please send me the schedule and venue. I know that at least 10

We'll accept your apologies when Cheney publically accepts Harry
Whittington's apology for being in Cheney's line of fire and making

mIEKAL,

I've got to say I think you're pretty far off the mark as to what Rain Taxi
covers, as more than any other widely distributed review, they've
consistently shown themselves to be a venue for work that might far under
the rubric of the experimental, both in their reviews and interviews.

something of the sort, I'd say, what with the ass licking that rules the
day. Especially the ass-licking that some ass-lickers want to pass off

Geraldine Monk and Alan Halsey will be reading at Mills on Thursday - 6:30,
I believe. If there is a Mills-ite on the list, maybe they can provide site
information.
The reading last night at Moe's did not disappoint. Geraldine has a great
reading voice - particularly in reviving the body & voice behind the Ghost
of Mary Queen of Scots (imprisoned in Escafeld/Sheffield for 14 years - a
fact apparently ignored these days by the locals). Geraldine really 'rolls'
with it with lots of curious, inflected surprises along the way.
 Alan is equally, but different, in his historical 'made present
'investigations, including a rather wonderful account of Guttenberg's ghost,
the printed book confronting the digital virtal mode - using Google to
search, and an automatic translation device to get at G's history, mostly in
German. Guttenberg's original name apparently translates into English as
"Goose Flesh", and Guttenberg translates into "Good Mountain." Alan combines
a wonderful sense of serious, research, intellection and imaginative passion
to make the work quite present, compelling.
This transparency and dialog between past and present I find quite rich -
perhaps influenced but different than the Olson take. Maybe because English
history is so much longer and with more depth than chez here - these folks
(tho their English neighbors might ignore their works) are genuinely infused
- tho not at all oblivious to contemporary ironies, borderline flarfy
(Blair, Google et al).

 - SPD carries their West House Books imprint - quite beautifully produced.

They will be coming to NY/St. Marks sometime soon

Two Times
1.
The bright pillows of war-sail
in the brown/blue rain
'n' the swaying saffron of execution

- these are the adverts on the packets

And our shelves of herbs and skulls
our work-boots that pound the pantry,
cooler and freezer,
yea all which it inherit,
shall stay unsold,
sifting slowly into the lower breast
till the hourglass gifts us away

it lets them
wait
for ever and ever

2.
Joanne's Dad was working and building
putting up a goose house.
'n Joanne was watching 'n helping.
Finally they fixed
an old smoke-stack
on very top
with tin hat hood
like a turret.
Even the geese were satisfied.
An average slow warm time
on the backgrass.


Lucy Sheerman
The heart honeycombed; its collected spread
of prospects accrued in court precincts. Late
afternoon. Windows blazing. Walls gilded.
Sudden Suburban stillness. Sunbury.

Gold seams thread the fabric of the in thing
necklace boxed unthreading thirty years from
hand to throat spun into strands. Locketed.
The ache worn threadbare. Later years alter.

Settling. Sedimentary. Paint coats
over paint work. The lustre lost. Wake a
while. Blanket folds under fingers unfurled.
Feathers, leaves, stones, square the edges. Weighted

Down. Memories sink sleep deeper unmazed.
A king's picture - as I had dreampt of him -
chest covered in blood; heart on the outside.
Don't worry. Sound carries meaning intact.


Jeremy Hardingham. In 1997 Jeremy collaborated with eleven others to =20
make theatre called incarnate, performing in the streets at night. =20
Since then he is fortunate to have been helped through working with =20
theatre companies Signal to noise, Shunt, Mapping 4D, & The People =20
Show, amongst others, as a writer/performer, director and production =20

Tensions...
Things are not good in Baghdad.
There was an explosion this morning in a mosque in Samarra, a largely Sunni
town. While the mosque is sacred to both Sunnis and Shia, it is considered
one of the most important Shia visiting places in Iraq. Samarra is
considered a sacred city by many Muslims and historians because it was made
the capital of the Abassid Empire, after Baghdad, by the Abassid Caliph
Al-Mu=B9tasim.
The name =B3Samarra=B2 is actually derived from the phrase in Arabic =B3Sarre men
ra=B9a=B2 which translates to =B3A joy for all who see=B2. This is what the city wa=
s
named by Al-Mu=B9tasim when he laid the plans for a city that was to compete
with the greatest cities of the time- it was to be a joy for all who saw it=
.
It remained the capital of the Abassid Empire for nearly sixty years and
even after the capital was Baghdad once again, Samarra flourished under the
care of various Caliphs.
The mosque damaged with explosives today is the =B3Askari Mosque=B2 which is
important because it is believed to be the burial place of two of the 12
Shia Imams- Ali Al-Hadi and Hassan Al-Askari (father and son) who lived and
died in Samarra. The site of the mosque is believed to be where Ali Al-Hadi
and Hassan Al-Askari lived and were buried. Many Shia believe Al-Mahdi =8Cal
muntadhar=B9 will also be resurrected or will reappear from this mosque.
I remember visiting the mosque several years ago- before the war. We visite=
d
Samarra to have a look at the famous =B3Malwiya=B2 tower and someone suggested
we also visit the Askari mosque. I was reluctant as I wasn=B9t dressed
properly at the time- jeans and a t-shirt are not considered mosque garb. W=
e
stopped by a small shop in the city and purchased a few inexpensive black
abbayas for us women and drove to the mosque.
We got there just as the sun was setting and I remember pausing outside the
mosque to admire the golden dome and the intricate minarets. It was
shimmering in the sunset and there seemed to be a million colors- orange,
gold, white- it was almost glowing. The view was incredible and the
environment was so peaceful and calm. There was none of the bustle and nois=
e
usually surrounding religious sites- we had come at a perfect time. The
inside of the mosque didn=B9t disappoint either- elaborate Arabic script and
more gold and this feeling of utter peace=8A I=B9m grateful we decided to visit
it.
We woke up this morning to news that men wearing Iraqi security uniforms
walked in and detonated explosives, damaging the mosque almost beyond
repair. It=B9s heart-breaking and terrifying. There has been gunfire all over
Baghdad since morning. The streets near our neighborhood were eerily empty
and calm but there was a tension that had us all sitting on edge. We heard
about problems in areas like Baladiyat where there was some rioting and
vandalism, etc. and several mosques in Baghdad were attacked. I think what
has everyone most disturbed is the fact that the reaction was so swift, lik=
e
it was just waiting to happen.
All morning we=B9ve been hearing/watching both Shia and Sunni religious
figures speak out against the explosions and emphasise that this is what is
wanted by the enemies of Iraq- this is what they would like to achieve-
divide and conquer. Extreme Shia are blaming extreme Sunnis and Iraq seems
to be falling apart at the seams under foreign occupiers and local fanatics=
.
No one went to work today as the streets were mostly closed. The situation
isn=B9t good at all. I don=B9t think I remember things being this tense-
everyone is just watching and waiting quietly. There=B9s so much talk of civi=
l
war and yet, with the people I know- Sunnis and Shia alike- I can hardly
believe it is a possibility. Educated, sophisticated Iraqis are horrified
with the idea of turning against each other, and even not-so-educated Iraqi=
s
seem very aware that this is a small part of a bigger, more ominous plan=8A
Several mosques have been taken over by the Mahdi militia and the Badir
people seem to be everywhere. Tomorrow no one is going to work or college o=
r
anywhere.

People are scared and watchful. We can only pray.=20

CHICAGO POETRY PROJECT
SEASON FIVE | READING FOUR
POETRY OF THE RELIGIOUS TURN

Nathaniel Mackey & Ed Roberson

Saturday, February 25, 2006 at 1:00pm
Chicago Authors Room, Harold Washington Library

www.chicagopoetryproject.org <http://www.chicagopoetryproject.org>

The fourth reading of the 2005/6 season brings
together two masters working in the idiom of open
field poetry.

Nathaniel Mackey is the author of several collections
of poetry, including Eroding Witness, School of Udhra,
Whatsaid Serif, and Four for Glenn, as well as the
critical works Discrepant Engagement: Dissonance,
Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing, and
Paracritical Hinge: Essays, Talks, Notes, Interviews,
which was published in 2005 by the University of
Wisconsin Press. In 2006, New Directions will publish
a new volume of poetry, Stray Anthem. He lives in
Santa Cruz, where he is a professor at the University
of California, and where he has been the long-time
host of the radio program "Tanganyika Strut" on KUSP,
88.9FM.

Speaking of the mutual involvement of "black
experimental writing" in their work, Mackey said that
for himself and Ed Roberson, "very early on, each at a
different time and in a somewhat different way, the
overlap between African American writing and
experimental writing had been so clear that we simply
took it for granted."

Ed Roberson has published several works of poetry,
including When Thy King Is a Boy, Etai-Eken, Lucid
Interval As Integral Music, Voices Cast Out to Call Us
In (which was the winner of the 1994 Iowa Poetry
Prize), Just In / Word of Navigational Challenges: New
and Selected Poems, and Atmosphere Conditions, which
was a winner of the National Poetry Series in 1998.
From New Jersey, Ed is currently living in Chicago,
teaching in the Poetry Program at Columbia College.

Talk Series - Robert Fitterman: Identity Theft: My Subjectivity
=20
The purloined, the sampled, the borrowed, the recycled, the reprocessed, th=
e
micromanaged. Tendencies in 21st Century innovative writing and
culture-making point convincingly to a shift from invention to inventory.
What is the social frame that has fostered this possibility and how has the
media and the Internet participated? In this talk, I want to explore how
=B3identity=B2 in contemporary poetry shifts to include many identities
=8Bpersonal, global, multiple. I hope to retrace some of the social history
that produced a generation of recyclers who are comfortable composing with
an infinite  number of sources through an infinite number of identities.
This model has not only become an important part of our cultural landscape,
but also =8B I would argue =8B a part of our prosody. Come as you are=8A come as
someone else=8A come as everyone else.

Robert Fitterman, born in St. Louis, 1959, is the author of 8 books of
poetry, including 3 installments of his ongoing poem Metropolis: Metropolis
1-15 (Sun & Moon Press, 2000), Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Books, 2002),
and Metropolis XXX: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Edge  Books,
2004). Earlier titles include Leases (Periphery Press), among the cynics
(Singing Horse Press) and Ameresque (Buck Downs Books). With novelist
Rodrigo Rey Rosa, he co-wrote the feature film What Sebastian Dreamt, which
was selected, in 2004, for the Sundance Film Festival and the Lincoln Cente=
r
Film Festival - LatinBeat. He teaches at New York University.


Wednesday, March 1, 8:00pm

Dear Wystan:

Hope everything's well with you. I'm collecting all stuff for the next
issue of _Nerter_ focused on anthologies of innovative poetry in the
world. I wonder if you have written some pages (4 or five pages are
enough) for this special issue on this kind anthologies focused on
New Zealand poetry. As you know, deadline was initially proposed for
February 10, though it has been extended until the end of March.

I've already received contributions from Singapore, Brazil, Portugal,
Spain, and Canada. And my plan is to edit up to 17 views on the role of
these anthologies of innovative poetry in diverse countries.

Thanks so much for your collaboration and look forward to hearing from you soon.
With best, as ever
Manuel Brito

Gallery 324 is having a Visual Poetry Show that needs to be reviewed.
It's at

Gallery 324
The Galleria at Erieview
1301 East Ninth Street
Cleveland, Ohio 44114

216/780-1522
marcus@designerglass.com

Please also consider this a call for submissions. Email submissions of
jpgs of your work should be sent to the curators who will give you
instructions on how to get it to the show. The curators are:

Wendy Sorin  -- wcsorin@gmail.com,
John Byrum -- generatorpress@sbcglobal.net,
Bob Grumman -- bobgrumman@nut-n-but.net

The preliminary Press Release:

Gallery 324,
The Galleria at Erieview, 1301 East Ninth Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44114

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Gallery 324 at the Galleria at Erieview is hosting a show of Visual Poetry
work called Blends & Bridges:  A Survey of International Contemporary
Visual Poetry. The show will be curated by local poets Wendy Sorin, and
John Byrum, and Florida poet Bob Grumman.

 OPENING RECEPTION: Saturday 1 April 2006     5 - 9 PM
          Exhibition continues through April 30, 2006

Gallery Hours:  Monday - Friday 10 - 6, Saturday 10 - 2, and by
appointment

This show is about the world interpreted by men and women who are
using not only words and spaces between words, but the arrangement of
those words and spaces in their work to create interest, meaning, and
art.
These are works by artists from around the country and around the
world
who form a loose group committed to combining the visual with the
verbal
and the verbal with the visual. In most cases the visual nature of their
work cuts them off from the poetry establishment, while its verbal nature
alienates the visual arts establishment, but these men and women are
exploring the further ranges of what it means to make art, and their
approaches move along a continuum from grand fun to something in
some
cases approaching the High Sublime, both from one work to another and
sometimes in the same piece.

Side by side by side, viewers can see both the similarities and
differences in the entire notion of Visual Poetry, and appreciate the
courage and conviction of artists who are not content with the common
notions of the boundaries between one art and another.

 Gallery 324 is an art gallery founded in 2005. The goal is to

(McMurdo
Station, camps accessible from McMurdo, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole

the months of isolation at McMurdo or South Pole likewise would require
compelling reasons for support.  The McMurdo Winfly period (mid-August
through September) could be attractive for some kinds of projects.  =

writers and visual artists collaboratively propose what words and forms the
future will hold.

It runs this Summer from June 24 to August 4.  Faculty include...

John Ashbery / Mairéad Byrne / Steve Clay / Michael Gizzi / Ann Lauterbach
Michael Magee / Peter Schjeldahl / Lynne Tillman / Wendy Walters

Dear List- If anyone is interested, my next free chapbook will be coming out
in a week or two. It is titled "an accident of meaning" and it will be apart
of my regular free mailing list (some of you are already on it). The
following is an excerpt:

how do you eat
	an elephant?

one bite
at a time

don’t think about it
too much

there are 1,000 directions
but only one path

when what you call “me”
stops along the road
	to take a drink
run away!

Peace,
Ian VanHeusen

..aging BABY  BOOMERS can make aging SEXY, Notley, Hejinian, Silliman, AN
APPEAL FOR NEW  PASSION!

This is something I've been thinking about ever since I saw Lyn  Hejinian
read at Villanova a few years ago.  Ron Silliman and his wife were  sitting
in front of me, holding hands.  That was nice, but then she would  stroke
the back of his head, and he would give her a quick kiss.  It was SO
beautiful,
as public affection is always beautiful.

It's that generation of Free Thinking Open Fucking Love In that shifted  and
reshaped the framework of Values that --in my opinion-- has a new  challenge
before them!

While they were successful at bringing the world to the party when they  were
young and fun, can they do that again as old and fun?  The  MARKETPLACE
seemed (continues to seem) more than pleased with their early shot of
Rock 'N Roll, creating webs of industry out of that energy.  Do I want  to
talk
about The MARKETPLACE?  Truth is I DON'T, except that it's there  where
success is most transparent.

LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR that I do NOT mean Cher when I'm saying
old and fun.  Meaning OLD AND HOT, OLD AND SEXY!  Cher and  her
many aging BOTX, face lift, hair dye, wig culture is exactly what I'm  NOT
AT ALL INTERESTED IN GIVING PROPS TO!

NO!  I'm meaning, AGING, visibly graying and wrinkling as  HOT!  To me it
seems like something that HAS TO BE OWNED FIRST!  As some DO I  believe!

Getting the world to look to another, very different place when we think  of
LOVE and SEX and FUN and EXCITING PASSION is what I'm hoping.

Seems like a GREAT thing!  And as far as poets in their 50s or older,  I can
think of A BUNCH OF them who can help PULL THIS OFF!  Change US!

AN APPEAL TO YOU AGING POETS TO HELP MAKE THE DIFFERENCE,

APPEAL FOR NEW  PASSION!

This is something I've been thinking about ever since I saw Lyn  Hejinian
read at Villanova a few years ago.  Ron Silliman and his wife were  sitting
in front of me, holding hands.  That was nice, but then she would  stroke
the back of his head, and he would give her a quick kiss.  It was SO
beautiful,
as public affection is always beautiful.

It's that generation of Free Thinking Open Fucking Love In that shifted  and
reshaped the framework of Values that --in my opinion-- has a new  challenge
before them!

While they were successful at bringing the world to the party when they  were
young and fun, can they do that again as old and fun?  The  MARKETPLACE
seemed (continues to seem) more than pleased with their early shot of
Rock 'N Roll, creating webs of industry out of that energy.  Do I want  to
talk
about The MARKETPLACE?  Truth is I DON'T, except that it's there  where
success is most transparent.

LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR that I do NOT mean Cher when I'm saying
old and fun.  Meaning OLD AND HOT, OLD AND SEXY!  Cher and  her
many aging BOTX, face lift, hair dye, wig culture is exactly what I'm  NOT
AT ALL INTERESTED IN GIVING PROPS TO!

NO!  I'm meaning, AGING, visibly graying and wrinkling as  HOT!  To me it
seems like something that HAS TO BE OWNED FIRST!  As some DO I  believe!

Getting the world to look to another, very different place when we think  of
LOVE and SEX and FUN and EXCITING PASSION is what I'm hoping.

Seems like a GREAT thing!  And as far as poets in their 50s or older,  I can
think of A BUNCH OF them who can help PULL THIS OFF!  Change US!

AN APPEAL TO YOU AGING POETS TO HELP MAKE THE DIFFERENCE,
CAConrad

""""try this craig, it's called  'desire'

cheers
komninos

hope it gives you a lift!
""""

Well, Yeah that was uplifting!  Smoking Koalas and poetry can  always
give me a lift!

Thanks Komninos.

A couple people backchanneled instead of writing on the List  directly,
for whatever reason.  One was somewhat interested in pursuing  this
idea with me, then said, "...the Rolling Stones should not go on!"

Now, I understand that argument from different angles, especially the
angle from young musicians who are frustrated with the music industry
tied and kept in its place at times.

But with this argument is always the statement about how OLD they
look up there on stage.  Yeah, well, they're OLD, what do you  want!?
BUT, in a WAY, they really do embody some of what I'm talking about,
up there, wrinkled, STILL ROCKING!  Mick Jagger exudes that same
quality of Svengali on the rocks, good times in the back seat.  Or  maybe
in the hotel room.  I didn't go see them on their most recent tour,  but I'd
very much fuck Jagger!  He's quite fuckable!  Sexy!  And  OLD!

There's a poem Rachel Blau DuPlessis read at the Rosenbach Museum
here in Philadelphia that was sexy!  And I remember sitting there,  thinking
how great that was to hear from a woman her age.  And she read it  with
such defiance too!  Yeah, that was HOT!

no poets have gotten the Antarctic writing grant yet:

http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04558/nsf04558.htm





In the electronic proposal, summarize the places or research sites to be
visited, and state the approximate amount of field time needed.  NSF's
program solicitation,  <http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?nsf04559>
Antarctic Research, describes the operational capabilities of the U.S.
Antarctic Program.
<http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/treaty/opp04001/index.html> U.S.
Antarctic Research Program 2003-2004 contains paragraph descriptions of a
recent season of research projects.  There is no set minimum or maximum
amount of time in the field; the NSF goal is to match field support to the
requirement of the proposed project.   Nevertheless, give thought to the
size of the project being proposed.  For a large project that would require
comprehensive access to the Antarctic, NSF would expect to see compelling
reasons in terms of the two major review criteria of intellectual merit and
broader impacts (see section VI.A). A proposal for a smaller project could
convince NSF that it still would cover new and important topics and be more
operationally practical in the U.S. Antarctic Program.   Location also could
influence NSF's decision.  Fieldwork in the high-latitude Antarctic (McMurdo
Station, camps accessible from McMurdo, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole
Station) is in demand in the austral summer.  A long winter project during
the months of isolation at McMurdo or South Pole likewise would require
compelling reasons for support.  The McMurdo Winfly period (mid-August
through September) could be attractive for some kinds of projects.  Palmer
Station is accessible year-round as are the U.S. Antarctic Program
ice-capable research ships

>
> This show is about the world interpreted by men and women who are

> art.
> These are works by artists from around the country and around the

hey craig
you are still concentrating a lot on look
what if you were blind?
would age matter or texture?

getting old is not graceful, i don't care what anybody says.
i'm leaking squeaking and 'freaking'
things don't work like they used to
creams stop fungus from making me their home
stop me falling out of my own bum
everything is starting to sag
i think it was anne sexton who wrote
we don't die we just succumb to gravity.

sorry i'm not finding anything sexy about being an aging baby boomer
and there is no cure, except the thought of being young again.
sexy is really owned by the image makers and there is no way we can reclaim it in any other form.

i've been making love blind-folded lately
concentrating on sensations i am feeling and fantasies happening in my head when i am blindfolded and touching gently and introducing surprises (ice, feathers, oils, powder, hot towels etc) when i am not blindfolded and the pleasure giver.

aromatic fragrance oils make me feel sexy, candle light and good music, chill out music, light loose clothes.

i think we all have to find our own ways of feeling sexy rather than projecting a sexy image that will make people want to rip off their underwear and attack us, as you allude to as being a measure of sexiness.

it's sunday morning, i should be at church, checking out anyone who might be sexy - not!

Well, Yeah that was uplifting!  Smoking Koalas and poetry can  always
give me a lift!

Thanks Komninos.

A couple people backchanneled instead of writing on the List  directly,
for whatever reason.  One was somewhat interested in pursuing  this
idea with me, then said, "...the Rolling Stones should not go on!"

Now, I understand that argument from different angles, especially the
angle from young musicians who are frustrated with the music industry
tied and kept in its place at times.

But with this argument is always the statement about how OLD they
look up there on stage.  Yeah, well, they're OLD, what do you  want!?
BUT, in a WAY, they really do embody some of what I'm talking about,
up there, wrinkled, STILL ROCKING!  Mick Jagger exudes that same
quality of Svengali on the rocks, good times in the back seat.  Or  maybe
in the hotel room.  I didn't go see them on their most recent tour,  but I'd
very much fuck Jagger!  He's quite fuckable!  Sexy!  And  OLD!

There's a poem Rachel Blau DuPlessis read at the Rosenbach Museum
here in Philadelphia that was sexy!  And I remember sitting there,  thinking
how great that was to hear from a woman her age.  And she read it  with
such defiance too!  Yeah, that was HOT!

Not exactly sure what you're expecting or wanting from this, but it has made
me curious.  To be honest I'm too young to be considered a Baby Boomer, and
I don't think Mick Jagger is that hot, but hey, to each their own.  There
are plenty of older poets who are pretty hot though, but I'm not saying who
I'm thinking of, so please don't ask.

is this really how long people are reading now at segue? excluding the
eco-panel, only 9 of 30 readers went under 30 minutes (12 assuming
three-minute long introductions) and only 2 of 30 people went under 20
minutes. meanwhile, four readers went over 40 minutes.

for reading curators, how long do you tell yr readers that they should read.
i've always known of the 20-minute reading. it's the rare poet who can give
a 30- or 40-minute long reading and hold the crowd.

best,
david

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Here's a call for papers for the 2007 AWP in Atlanta:

Poets on Appropriative Writing

Raphael Rubinstein says "appropriative writing." Michael Davidson says
"palimtexts." Gregory Betts says "plunderverse." Purists say "plagiarism."
This panel of the AWP will feature poets whose writing incorporates source
texts as a compositional process and perhaps also with the intention of
challenging the idea of textual ownership. Poets in this panel will discuss
methods of appropriation in their own work and suggest theoretical issues
underlying their use of source texts. Please send abstracts (300-500 words)
and a brief biographical statement by email to Camille Martin:
<c8martin@ryerson.ca>. Deadline: April 15, 2006. The 2007 AWP will be in
Atlanta, February 28 - March 3.

True that I'm not old, certainly not old enough to understand aging in  the
way you want me to see, Komninos.  I'm respecting what you say,  but
when I talk about LOOKS it's a 180 degree shift away from the Market,
which assumes THE WORST really.  Assumes the fear of Death, the
fear of aging, the Fear the Fear of The FEAR of  it as it gets you.

The word on the street is that the cosmetic industry and the like are  dumping
enormous amounts of money into the research of Baby Boomers right  now.
Well, they HAVE BEEN, but especially now.

All this is just my way of saying that I'm hoping for a revolution against
it!
Against the creams the dyes the SHIT to cover the true YOU!
My HOPE is that YOU and your generation will say AS YOU HAVE BEFORE,
NO, WE'RE DOING IT OUR WAY, WE DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT YOU
WANT, WHAT YOU EXPECT, WHAT YOU WANT TO SELL US!

ALL YOU WHO HAD SIT-INS COULD HAVE (here I am organizing sit-ins,
which is kind of silly, but I don't care!) NEW SIT-INS AT THE  COSMETIC
COUNTERS OF MACY'S OR WHEREVER, LOOKING JUST AS YOU ARE,
AND KISSING, AND HUGGING, GIVING THE FINGER TO IT ALL!

This really ISN'T some silly notion I want here.  It's a big deal, our
collective,
national fear of aging, death, etc.....

When we look to the ancient alphabets, especially when I think of my  own
ancestors in the north of Europe, there was an amazing letter  "Pertho."
Pertho is the equivalent of our modern day P.  Pertho really didn't  (doesn't)
look much like P, but that's irrelevant.  The THING about Pertho  which
makes me so happy, is that THAT letter for P had its bulbous portion  being
flexible to face east or west.  Our P only faces east.  Pertho  could show
the decline facing west.

We've given up so much by denying decline.  Aging people who want  to
LOOK and feel young means they aren't involved in the natural  process.

Feeling ALIVE and VITAL as aging people can defy that, possibly.

Once, after a reading in Philadelphia at the Rosenbach Museum, a  bunch
of us went to this smoky little bar called DOOBIES (it's a great  place).
It was me, Frank Sherlock, Linh Dinh, shit who else there was my  age?
The elders were Ron Silliman, Bob Perelman, maybe a couple others.
But after a few beers I opened up about SEEING Silliman and his wife
at that Lyn Hejinian reading I mentioned in the original post to this  thread.
Maybe they thought I was being silly when I told them my idea that  they
can SAVE THE WORLD from future generations of age-fear, but no, I'm
very serious.

If any generation has proven its power, by its sheer NUMBERS, it's  the
Baby Boomer generation.

So, where do you want to have your first LOVE IN?  Outside a plastic
surgeon's?
Let me know, I'll be there with bullhorn man, I'm serious, I'll be  there!

Dear David:

Thank you for your post and I hope more of us pick up on this thread.

I usually get nervous and read short.  Oftentimes, too short, but, I =
also
suffer through readings where the reader says "oh, I've got some more =
and
then some new stuff" -- i.e., 10-15 minutes more -- at the time I'm =
ready to
cry "uncle""

which -- what is that idiom?  the man from u.n.c.....

anyways, 40 minutes is "upper limit" of my attention span for someone =
who
isn't a brilliant performer, or who is deliberately reading in a quiet /
lack of affect way, and I don't care if you're a "famous" poet, but -- =
you
know who you are -- reading with lack of affect or in a dull manner -- =
I'd
rather have dinner with you, buy you drinks, chat or walk your dog or
whatever... than listen to you drone your gorgeous poems rather than
represent them responsibly

and who wants to be listening excitedly, carefully, to a reading, wants =
to
sponsor a reading series, and find that snacks are 2 hours distant?

all best...

David,

Come to some of the Segue readings this year, and you'll see why audiences
are allowing the poets to go on so long.

This Saturday is going to be great. Nada Gordon and Anne Lauterbach (4:00

Thank you, Dan, especially for your customer service piece.  As someone who
went without usable telephone (and hence, dialup modem) service for a solid
week recently -- and whose language skills failed when trying to explain
transformer boxes on telephone poles to young people in India -- I am both
sympathetic to and comforted by your experience.

This morning's NY Times made reference to a website for cutting through the
clouds of unknowing that might come in handy some time.
http://www.gethuman.com/ provides methods for reaching human beings at many
US companies.

hey gary,

if d.a. levy rose from the dead i'd be cool with him reading north of 40
minutes, because he's one of my favorite poets but also because of the whole
curiosity factor of wondering what someone picks to read in their first
reading after rising from the dead.

but on his second and future readings i'd hope he sticks closer to 20
minutes.

best,
david

p.s. i've been going to segue readings since 1993 through four different
venues, and i look forward to seeing more of the great readings the series
has always hosted. i was even fortunate enough to be asked by kristin
prevallet and prageeta sharma to read in the series back in 2000. i kept it
under 20 minutes.

This is an interesting thread.  I was of the opinion that poetry readings =
could not be too short.  I trimmed back & trimmed back.  I got to the =
point where I felt: Actually, it's too short.  But I think that's as much =
to do with economics as anything else. =20
Like if someone flies you 800 miles, collects you at the airport, brings =
you to dinner, drums up an audience, and then you look up from the =
lectern, smile, and say "Ah." "Thank you very much."   Well, not quite, =
but distance traveled to the reading, by poet & audience, may enter into =
the equation.  Not in the BPC where everyone is assumed to be a New =
Yorker, or at least tolerated at such, or clothed in that delicate fiction =
for the duration of the reading.  A one-word reading might be just the =
thing for someone you are already in close-proximity to.  I know I =
shouldn't end on a preposition.  So I will say that it's always worth =
considering money; poetry readings are strange in that respect.  The =
audience generally doesn't pay and whether the poet gets paid or not, or =
how much, doesn't seem to materially affect the performance or the =
willingness to read.  However, where money is involved, its relationship =
to the reading may weigh on the person who raised it, or who hands over =
the check.

Dear David:

Thank you for your post and I hope more of us pick up on this thread.

I usually get nervous and read short.  Oftentimes, too short, but, I also
suffer through readings where the reader says "oh, I've got some more and
then some new stuff" -- i.e., 10-15 minutes more -- at the time I'm ready =
to
cry "uncle""

which -- what is that idiom?  the man from u.n.c.....

anyways, 40 minutes is "upper limit" of my attention span for someone who
isn't a brilliant performer, or who is deliberately reading in a quiet /
lack of affect way, and I don't care if you're a "famous" poet, but -- you
know who you are -- reading with lack of affect or in a dull manner -- I'd
rather have dinner with you, buy you drinks, chat or walk your dog or
whatever... than listen to you drone your gorgeous poems rather than
represent them responsibly

and who wants to be listening excitedly, carefully, to a reading, wants to
sponsor a reading series, and find that snacks are 2 hours distant?

all best...

NEW FROM THE MODERN & CONTEMPORY POETICS SERIES!
Hart Crane
After His Lights
Brian M. Reed

“Reed’s scholarship is thorough, his criticism creative, and his
writing style limpid.” —Susan M. Schultz, author of A Poetics of
Impasse in Modern and Contemporary Poetry

A study of Crane’s poetic output that takes into account, but also
questions, the post-structural and theoretical developments in
humanities scholarship of the last decade that have largely approached
Crane in a piecemeal way, or pigeonholed him as representative of his
class, gender, or sexual orientation. Reed examines Crane’s career
from his juvenilia to his posthumous critical reception and his impact
on practicing poets following World War II. The first part of the
study tests common rubrics of literary theory—nationality, sexuality,
period—against Crane’s poetry, and finds that these labels, while
enlightening, also obfuscate the origin and character of the poet’s
work. The second part examines Crane’s poetry through the process of
its composition, sources, and models, taking up questions of style,
genealogy, and genre. The final section examines Crane’s influence on
subsequent generations of American poets, especially by avant-garde
literary circles like the New American poets, the Black Mountain
School, the New York School, and the Beats.
The result is a study that complicates and enriches our understandings
of Crane’s poetry and contributes to the ongoing reassessment of
literary modernism’s origins, course, and legacy.

Brian M. Reed is Assistant Professor of English at the University of
Washington, Seattle, and coeditor of Situating El Lissitzky: Moscow,
Vitebsk, Berlin.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I'm reposting this because the email address to send abstracts to didn't
appear properly in the poetics archives.

Here's a call for papers for the 2007 AWP in Atlanta:

Poets on Appropriative Writing

Raphael Rubinstein says "appropriative writing." Michael Davidson says
"palimtexts." Gregory Betts  says "plunderverse." Purists say "plagiarism."
This panel of the AWP will feature poets whose writing incorporates source
texts as a compositional process and perhaps also with the intention of
challenging the idea of textual ownership. Poets in this panel will discuss
methods of appropriation in their own work and suggest theoretical issues
underlying their use of source texts.

Please send abstracts (300-500 words) and a brief biographical statement by
email to Camille Martin:

c8martin at ryerson dot ca

Deadline: April 15, 2006

Please note that the time limit for individual presentations will be 15-20
minutes, depending on the number of speakers on the panel.

The 2007 AWP will be in Atlanta, February 28 - March 3.

Final Text of letter sent to Assembly of First Nations re trip to Israel


The victims of genocide at the hands of European settler colonialism
cannot and should not give cover for another form of settler colonialism
that has committed and continues to commit wholesale ethnic cleansing
and genocide against the Palestinian people and nation.



CANADA PALESTINE ASSOCIATION
http://www.cpavancouver.org

February 23, 2006
Open letter to the Assembly of First Nations

We are saddened, hurt and shocked by the visit of a delegation of the
Assembly of First Nations (AFN) to Israel, as well as the following
statement attributed to AFN National Chief Phil Fontaine:
"Indigenous people in Canada have much in common with the people of
Israel, including a respect of the land and their languages. This
mission is an excellent opportunity for us to share our values and our
traditional ways of life, in the hope of building greater understanding,
awareness and respect for our similarities and differences, both at home
and abroad". http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=2276

The victims of genocide at the hands of European settler colonialism
cannot and should not give cover for another form of settler colonialism
that has committed and continues to commit wholesale ethnic cleansing
and genocide against the Palestinian people and nation. In 1948, over
four hundred villages and towns were wiped off the Palestinian and world
map and their cemeteries desecrated; two thirds of the Palestinian
people were uprooted from their historic homeland and forced to live in
reservations called refugee camps for the past fifty-eight years, most
outside of their historic land. (See "All That Remains" By Prof. Walid
Khalidi
http://palestineremembered.com/Acre/Palestine-Remembered/Story661.html )

Perhaps the chiefs, elders and leaders of the Assembly of First Nations
don't know the history of the Zionist movement. In fact, it was coined
on the model of the European settler colonialist movement that preceded
it four hundred years earlier and committed the genocide against the
indigenous peoples. The Zionist movement was also built on the South
Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Algeria and other
European settler colonialist models of the same era - late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries.

Here is what the first Zionist Congress held in Basle, Switzerland (in
Europe) in 1897 listed as some of the aims of the movement:

"Zionism strives to create for the Jewish people a homeland in Palestine
secured by public law. The congress contemplates the following means to
the attainment of this end:

1- The promotion on suitable lines of the colonization of Palestine by
Jewish agricultural and industrial workers. (our emphasis)"

And Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, wrote in his book
The Jewish State in 1896:
"We should there form a portion of the rampart of Europe against Asia,
an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism. (our emphasis)"

So doesn't this logic sound familiar? We are sure that it is painfully
familiar to your ancestors and to your people who face racism on a daily
basis.

We are sorry that we do not have the means to take you on similar tours
to show you what is really happening in Palestine. Perhaps you should
ask the hundreds of international volunteers, including Canadians, who
paid their own way to go there and bear witness to the continuous
Israeli brutality against the indigenous people of Palestine (See
http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/ ). We are sure your Israeli and
Zionist hosts will never take you to see the remains of the four hundred
villages that were systematically destroyed, nor will they show you the
Apartheid wall, the refugee camps, the tens of thousands of uprooted
trees nor will they tell you that over 95 per cent of the land that
Israel sits on is stolen land from the indigenous Palestinian
population. If Chief Fontaine thinks that Israel has respect for the
land, he is either unaware or complicit in covering up the massive
Israeli injustice against the indigenous people of Palestine.

We will be frank with you. In the name of the vanquished indigenous
people, you are being used to justify and cover up not only the Israeli
atrocities and war crimes committed against the Palestinian people but
also Israeli support for racism and oppression against the peoples of
Africa, Asia, central and south America.

This should not pass. The sooner you clarify your position, the sooner
you will salvage your name and credibility. Already messages on the
Internet are describing your collaboration with the Zionist
organizations under the title: "Friends of neocolonialism meet". We hope
that you will not be remembered as friends of European settler
colonialists who committed genocide against the Palestinian people and
were motivated by conquest, greed and superiority, the same evil
motivations that enslaved the Native people of the Americas.

It is an offence and a crime against our native brothers and sisters who
are still living and to those who perished in the process of
colonization, to associate with the crimes of the Israeli settler
colonialist state that is committing genocide against the native people
of Palestine.
Since the year 2000, over eight hundred Palestinian "Dudley Georges"
were murdered every year at the hands of the neo-fascist regime in Israel.

Are these the people who you "have much in common with" and that you
want to build cultural comparisons with? Are these the people you want
to share your "values and ... traditional ways of life" with?

If so, you are complicit in their war crimes and you should not do it in
the name of the First Nations Peoples.

Indigenous peoples must never be a party to genocide against the
Palestinian people nor any other oppressed people facing occupation,
genocide and theft of their land and natural resources.

Six-week Course with Rachel Levitsky @ Poets House starts March 7:
=A0
Writing from the Outside=20
Instructor: Rachel Levitsky=20
Tuesdays, 7-9:30pm, March 7=96April 11=20
$240, Space is limited=20

One aspect of poetry is movement in and out of the membrane that =
separates
an interior from its exterior. We will investigate how poets utilize =
aspects
of the =91outside' world to dialogue with and enter subterranean
consciousness. Readings will focus on the work of the poets Rosmarie
Waldrop, Marcella Durand, and John Ashberry. During each class, with =
more
and less specific directions (exercises) from the facilitator, we will =
mine
these poets' work for ways into our own mysterious interiors.

Rachel Levitsky's poetry collection, Under the Sun, was published in =
2003.
She is the founder and co-curator of Belladonna* and has recently taught
workshops at The Poetry Project and Naropa University.=20

Classes are open to all, but space is limited. To register, please call =
us
at 212-431-7920 or email stephen@poetshouse.org.

Mairead--you raise some great points taking this thread to another level

And Maria Damon's call for february compassion and kindness--
"try a little tenderness" etc--
yeah, too---

What I think would be helpful in this discussion
would be for people to think about their own readings in light of this
(though maybe I'm only talking about myself, still I do believe in a kind of
UNIVERSALIZING MY MAXIM in this instance....)

For instance, I think it would be really cool if others gave an
example/account of a reading they themselves gave that they FELT (it's going
to be subjective of course, even if your audience gave you some verbal or
non-verbal feedback that confirms your feeling) was THE BEST or ONE OF THE
BEST...

And then, with equal candor, gave an example/account of a reading
that they felt to be THE WORST or ONE OF THE WORST you gave, a reading where
you feel, for whatever reasons, you fucked up, you didn't get over,
whatever, and in this account as much as possible do it without blaming the
audience (or lack thereof).

In fact, if I get MONEY someday (since mairead talks of MONEY), I think it'd
be great to publish a book, or a CD in which people---okay, I'll say POETS--
talk about this stuff.

I think it's great that there's been a little more interest in things like
READING REPORTS in recent years, but the SELF-READING REPORT might help
supplement that stuff, and help ground the discussion of "poets going too
long" in that compassionate way of which Maria writes....

While some say "JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED---
Poets will judge (no matter how much they often say they don't--)
but *I* say If you gotta judge, judge yourself too
and it very well may take the sting off the way you judge (whether
explicitly or implicitly) others....
(and, don't worry, it won't "blow your credibility," at least not for me--
quite the opposite, actually....!

Anyway, I was going to give an example of what I consider to be one of the
WORST readings I think I gave (which may not be the worst reading YOU think
I gave), but I've gone on too long, so I'll try to make it really short---
It was in SEATTLE in JUNE 2002, on a little west coast reading tour with a
great friend and poet (and musician, it turns out, though we didn't do any
music this time) with Brett Eugene Ralph. And this was in part because I
went "too short", but there were other factors involved.

I'll say more about this later perhaps, depending on which way this
conversation turns.

Chris

Yes, what is more fun:
1. Cheney among his buddies with a shot gun (a little drunk and off-balance=
)
or=20
2. Cheney sitting 'lotus position' bequeathing compassion unto the cosmos,
as well as globe and nation.

I guess number "1" Indulges one's love of cruelty - especially when it
backfires and hits the wrong object (poor Henry).
And number "2" - since it's a position impossible to imagine in reality -
indulges one's cruel love of the ironic.

But, Nick, I would suggest, & boring. 'titillation' ad infinitum is also
boring - a reading full of 'titters' becomes audience self-congratulatory.

I heard Tom Raworth read on Friday evening here in San Francisco. I don't
remember anyone 'tittering' - though there is a cruel  aspect to the work -
cutting right through to the core of syntax as fact - ironically, one can
say Tom's work on that level is 'cruel to be kind.'  On some level, always =
a
lover!

It is interesting how the language of marketing is entering the discussion of poetry reading. Some poets read long, some read short, For instance, Ann Waldman and David Antin read long, interestingly in both "performativeness" (as opposed to simple performance) being a significant aspect of their work. It seems to me a reading tends to lengthen as the idea of a "well-made" poem for the poet disappears.

Also, longer readings are riskier, in terms of reading poems one is not  sure of and also at places boring or losing the audience. Market considerations push to aversions of risks whereas poetry (writing and reading) it seems to me involves anteing up risk taking.

To answer a previous question about personal experiences of reading, my longest reading accured about two years ago in San Fransisco. At my arrival the day before, Steve Dickison told me I had to read two hours. I was in a panic and negotiated for ninety minutes. I was also running a fever. All I remember in that reading is that after about forty minutes (the maximuim upper limit) I entered a zone and started reading poems and using a performance style I would not have done otherwise. Particularly, I read a poem, "Baha-Mas in the Berkshires," constitued mostly of two parallel running columns, which required fluid, improvisational movements in both directions across columns -acting out a conflict between the ear and the eye. That would not have been possible in the first twenty minutes, even later perhaps, if I were not simultaneously fighting a collapse due to the fever.

Another memorable performance- to myself- occured about twelve years ago at The Poetry Project when I first read from my long poem "Io's Song." I lost about half of my audience (and in a sense my friends) that evening, who had known me as the poet of pithy, jewel-like, explosive poems ("Turkish Voices") and did not even stick around to say hello. Later, I was told that someoneone suggested that I should be told that I had gone insane.

Bruce Covey, David McAleavey and Kim Roberts will read on Monday,
February 27th at the Burlesque Poetry Hour

Reading begins at 8:00 p.m. in The Dark Room at Bar Rouge.

http://burlesquepoetryhour.blogspot.com


Bruce Covey teaches at Emory University and is the author of The
Greek Gods as Telephone Wires and the forthcoming Ten Pins, Ten
Frames (March, 2006)-both from Front Room Publishers in Ann Arbor,
Michigan. In addition to his work in The Bedside Guide to the No Tell
Motel, his recent poems appear or are forthcoming in 26, The Hat,
Bombay Gin, Explosive Magazine, LIT, 88, Boog City, 580 Split, Pool,
One Less Magazine, and other journals. He edits the web-based poetry
magazine Coconut and curates the What's New in Poetry reading series
in Atlanta.

David McAleavey teaches creative writing & American & English poetry
& literature at GW, where he also directs the creative writing
program. His most recent book is HUGE HAIKU, a compilation of 17 sets
of 17 poems, each with 17 lines (grouped in 5-, 7-, and 5-ll.
stanzas), each with 17 syllables (in groups of 5, 7, and 5
syllables). HUGE HAIKU appeared last year from Chax Press in Tucson,
Arizona, and has just over 300 pages. He's recently gave readings
from the book in Seattle and Portland OR. And as far as steps into
intimacy go, he'll confess that a long time ago he went to a
striptease show, in another country, where a dark-haired dancer
played with scarves and her long gloves a great deal. He thinks he'll
wear a scarf, or maybe a necktie, and a leather vest. If he had a
necktie with an exotic dancer on it, he'd definitely wear it.

Kim Roberts is the author of a book of poems, The Wishbone Galaxy,
and editor of Beltway Poetry Quarterly. She has been trying, for many
years, to get published in literary journals starting with every
letter of the alphabet. With the acceptance of a poem in Yemassee
Review (in an issue to be published in Summer 2006), she will have
finally gotten the last remaining letter, and officially conquered
the alphabet.

Hi David,

This is kind of a dodge, but those 30+ minute Penn Sound recordings
usually include the introduction, the shucking and jiving as the reader
takes the mike, time sinks of the "can you hear me in the back/is this
thing on?" variety and, if the audience is lucky, some revealing
asides, occasionally more memorable than the reading. So what looks
like 40 minutes on the mp3 is often closer to 20, 25. IMHO, it's all
those incidentals that locate a reading and make it a different order
of experience than the book.

On the larger question though of how long should poets read, something
Ron Silliman blogged about way back sticks with me, about how readings
seem longer on one coast than another, and how he appreciates when
folks stretch out. I used to think 20 minutes was the Golden Mean. But
many readings I've seen open out if you push through--you're ready to
pull your hair out at 30, 40 minutes, then something clicks and you're
in the poet's groove in a way that never would have happened if they'd
stopped earlier, or you'd left. Clark Coolidge comes to mind. He says
he wonders why poets don't read in sets, like jazz musicians, and in
some cases--not all--I think that would really work well.

So Chris, I'll throw Clark Coolidge out there as the BEST example for
the long reading. I'd add you too, as the master of the extended aside
that runs the shot clock, but never has me looking at my watch to see
by how much. I'd be interested to hear others'.

Best,
Rodney

I'll second that about Clark Coolidge.  His readings are so long notions =
of horizontality & verticality go out the window.  It's a landscape not a =
reading, the poetry equivalent of environment.

hi rodney,

so yre saying that if a poet tells stories or extended anecdotes during
their reading that these don't keep the reading time clock moving? what if
they give a two-minute introduction to a 30-second piece, does that go down
as 30 seconds or 2 minutes and 30 seconds? whenever i've given readings i
always thought the clock started at "hi" and ended at "thanks," whatever i
said in between.

one of the reasons i started this thread is that after i saw those segue
reading times and thought how long the poets were reading for i wondered
about time constraints at readings. i know that all the times i've been
asked to read, or asked others to read, there's always been a time limit
given. and when i'm given that time--be it three minutes at the poetry
project's new year's day marathon or two 20-minute sets at larry's in
columbus, ohio--i practice the reading ahead of time, including the
introductions, so that when i go up to read i fill the slot or go a bit
under.

to me there's nothing that show's more of a lack of professionalism or
respect for your audience than a poet who goes way long at a reading or
doesn't prepare sufficiently ahead of time. like those poets who leaf
through their notebooks at the podium to pick what to read, not usually
because they want to gauge the audience but because they don't have their
acts together. and i've never enjoyed it when a poet goes up there, picks a
piece out after thumbing through a pile of work, reads a few lines to
themselves, and then says, "nah, i'm not gonna read this one."

best,
david

There's a vaccuum. With Creeley's death, something big
was lost. Tone. I hear people quoting the words of
second-string ballplayers. All those chicken littles
don't understand they's prostrate yesterday and
denuded 1 hr ago. You are a reading away from nobody.
Best some of us start licking our chops. This aint no
democracy, and it aint polite, and it friendly, nor
liberal, nor open minded, but rather is the
understanding that there needs to be a place that
represents our best.

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

httt://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 7 pieces by Clemente Pad=EDn.

Because visual poetry (and all concrete poetry is visual poetry, but
not all visual poetry is concrete poetry) operates on the level of
immediate apprehension it has a power to flip the switch of paradigm
shift so fast it is, increasingly in this
sound-bite/iconographic/high-speed short attention span quick-scan world, it
is the kind of poetry that should be the most feared by any power
attempting to control a population through media manipulation.

No one knows this, or shows this, more fully than Clemente Pad=EDn.

Come look, learn, enjoy.

Regards,
Dan

Why read? What does a reading do - to reading - to speaking?

  Why speak? What, in fact, is "to speak?"

  What is the aim of reading and speaking?

  In the dynamic of a reading, per se, what's the point, practically?

  I remember Keith Waldrop saying that when he heard Creeley read his  work for the first time it changed how he read/heard Creeley's work -  essentially, that Creeley's line was based on a setting out - on  beginnings (and so origins) - rather than endings and arrivings - about  the hard traveling rather than hitting a spot (touristic or otherwise).

  So, what is the aim of a reading - the roaring head - then?

  I also thought of listening to Clark Coolidge reading - that feeling of abdication - of letting go - listening.

  It's a common take that the contemporary attention span among the  educated per se is inside 18 minutes - that people form a qualitative  impression in about 3 seconds (which rarely diverges short term) -  while retention of what is read is usually minimal (a sentence or  phrase) - while mostly what people remember from a reading is what the  reader was wearing.

 In the late 1950's, TV executives  apochrapturously are said to have blocked out a plan to get America's  attention span inside 15 minutes - to about 13 minutes - in time for  the commercial.

 You can trick that "listening time" out by  the use of visual material, say, or through shifts of writing, assuming  they are sufficiently divergent, etc.

Is it about leaving the  listener hungry? Answer delays question but who is asking? Caring?  Feeling? Whose heart are we breaking - mind blowing? Where do words  end/begin? Where the tube to break and pipe through?

hi rodney,

so yre saying that if a poet tells stories or extended anecdotes during
their reading that these don't keep the reading time clock moving? what if
they give a two-minute introduction to a 30-second piece, does that go down
as 30 seconds or 2 minutes and 30 seconds? whenever i've given readings i
always thought the clock started at "hi" and ended at "thanks," whatever i
said in between.

one of the reasons i started this thread is that after i saw those segue
reading times and thought how long the poets were reading for i wondered
about time constraints at readings. i know that all the times i've been
asked to read, or asked others to read, there's always been a time limit
given. and when i'm given that time--be it three minutes at the poetry
project's new year's day marathon or two 20-minute sets at larry's in
columbus, ohio--i practice the reading ahead of time, including the
introductions, so that when i go up to read i fill the slot or go a bit
under.

to me there's nothing that show's more of a lack of professionalism or
respect for your audience than a poet who goes way long at a reading or
doesn't prepare sufficiently ahead of time. like those poets who leaf
through their notebooks at the podium to pick what to read, not usually
because they want to gauge the audience but because they don't have their
acts together. and i've never enjoyed it when a poet goes up there, picks a
piece out after thumbing through a pile of work, reads a few lines to
themselves, and then says, "nah, i'm not gonna read this one."

best,
david

Hmm. Make the title of your first poem count? Read "the funny one" first?
Start with a really cool introduction which lets everyone know what wonders
they're about to hear? Smile? Frown knowingly? Wink, and give them the gun
shoot shoot finger while making that sexy clicking sound out the right side
of your mouth? So much can happen in three seconds. Maybe we could cut that
to two, if we really put our minds to it.

>
>"People may call these 'genius grants,' " Butler said in a

>
>"Kindred" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of

>$5,000 advance for "Kindred."
>

>
>"Octavia was one of the purest writers I know," Barnes
>recalled Sunday. "She put everything she had into her work -

>
>Due added, "It is a clich=E9 to say that she was too good a

>was the deep pain she felt about the injustices around her.
>All of it was a metaphor for war, poverty, power struggles
>and discrimination. All of that hurt her very deeply, but
>her gift was that she could use words for the pain and make

>
>Due believed that Butler came to feel deeply at home in the

>The anonymity of her life in Seattle suited both her
>artistic devotion and temperament ("I always felt a deep

>frequent participant in readings and writers' conferences,
>especially Clarion West, which played a crucial role in her
>own start. She also served on the advisory board of Seattle's
>Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.
>
>A few friends did get to see the relaxed Butler away from

>Howle, who took her to see the recent version of "King
>Kong." Howle describes the writer as "one of the most fun
>people to be around, with an acerbic sense of humor and a
>keen observer of human nature."
>
>Butler was a confirmed non-driver who would chat with other

>

>

This sounds like a good but difficult project.  Ageism is rampant in our American cultures.  I can only say that in the gay male subculture ageism rules.  As for the poets mentioned in the heading, all power to them if making aging sexy is actually a part of their poetic or social agenda.

Craig Allen Conrad <CAConrad9@AOL.COM> wrote:  ..aging BABY BOOMERS can make aging SEXY, Notley, Hejinian, Silliman, AN
APPEAL FOR NEW PASSION!

This is something I've been thinking about ever since I saw Lyn Hejinian
read at Villanova a few years ago. Ron Silliman and his wife were sitting
in front of me, holding hands. That was nice, but then she would stroke
the back of his head, and he would give her a quick kiss. It was SO
beautiful,
as public affection is always beautiful.

It's that generation of Free Thinking Open Fucking Love In that shifted and
reshaped the framework of Values that --in my opinion-- has a new challenge
before them!

While they were successful at bringing the world to the party when they were
young and fun, can they do that again as old and fun? The MARKETPLACE
seemed (continues to seem) more than pleased with their early shot of
Rock 'N Roll, creating webs of industry out of that energy. Do I want to
talk
about The MARKETPLACE? Truth is I DON'T, except that it's there where
success is most transparent.

LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR that I do NOT mean Cher when I'm saying
old and fun. Meaning OLD AND HOT, OLD AND SEXY! Cher and her
many aging BOTX, face lift, hair dye, wig culture is exactly what I'm NOT
AT ALL INTERESTED IN GIVING PROPS TO!

NO! I'm meaning, AGING, visibly graying and wrinkling as HOT! To me it
seems like something that HAS TO BE OWNED FIRST! As some DO I believe!

Getting the world to look to another, very different place when we think of
LOVE and SEX and FUN and EXCITING PASSION is what I'm hoping.

Seems like a GREAT thing! And as far as poets in their 50s or older, I can
think of A BUNCH OF them who can help PULL THIS OFF! Change US!

AN APPEAL TO YOU AGING POETS TO HELP MAKE THE DIFFERENCE,
CAConrad

What a strange and sudden way for one of our greatest literary visionaries
to go . . .  So young, and so many great books yet to come, it seemed.  This
is tragic news.

She was in Philly only last Fall, at Robin's Books . . . also recently did a
brief interview on Democracy Now.

Octavia E. Butler

SEATTLE (AP) -- Octavia E. Butler, considered the first black woman to gain
national prominence as a science fiction writer, died Friday. She was 58.

Butler, who had high blood pressure and heart problems, fell and struck her
head on the cobbled walkway outside her home, said Leslie Howle, a longtime
friend and employee at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in
Seattle.

Butler's work used the genre's artistic freedom to explore race, poverty,
politics, religion and human nature, Howle said. Some characters had extra
sensory perception or fluid physiology.

Jane Jewell, executive director of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers
of America, said Butler was one of the first black women to explore the
genre and the most prominent. But Butler would have been a major writer of
science fiction regardless of race or gender, she said.

''She is a world-class science fiction writer in her own right,'' Jewell
said. ''She was one of the first and one of the best to discuss gender and
race in science fiction.''

Her first novel, ''Kindred,'' in 1979, featured a black woman who travels
back in time to the South to save a white man. She went on to write about a
dozen books, plus numerous essays and short stories. Her most recent work,
''Fledgling,'' an examination of the ''Dracula'' legend, was published last
fall.

Butler's Xenogenesis Trilogy, which includes ''Dawn'' (1987), ''Adulthood
Rites'' (1988) and ''Imago'' (1989), concerned the pooling of genes between
aliens and post-apocalyptic earthlings in order for survival. The series was
retitled and reissued as ''Lilith's Brood.''

The Patternist Series included ''Patternmaster'' (1976), ''Mind of My Mind''
(1977), ''Survivor'' (1978), ''Wild Seed'' (1980) and ''Clay's Ark'' (1984).
It dealt with the saga of telepath-controlled humans at odds with mutants.

''Bloodchild and Other Stories'' (1995) won Hugo and Nebula awards. In 1995
Butler was the first science fiction writer granted a ''genius'' award from
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which paid $295,000 over
five years.

(sorry, bad URL first time I sent this)

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 7 pieces by Clemente Pad=EDn.

Because visual poetry (and all concrete poetry is visual poetry, but
not all visual poetry is concrete poetry) operates on the level of
immediate apprehension it has a power to flip the switch of paradigm
shift so fast it is, increasingly in this
sound-bite/iconographic/high-speed short attention span quick-scan world, it
is the kind of poetry that should be the most feared by any power
attempting to control a population through media manipulation.

No one knows this, or shows this, more fully than Clemente Pad=EDn.

Come look, learn, enjoy.

Dan

hey sam i like the way you think.
you seem to have a lot of experience with audiences.
have you written or published anything on the issue of performance of poetry or sounding of poetry(i think all sounding is a performance)

Why read? What does a reading do - to reading - to speaking?

  Why speak? What, in fact, is "to speak?"

  What is the aim of reading and speaking?

  In the dynamic of a reading, per se, what's the point, practically?

  I remember Keith Waldrop saying that when he heard Creeley read his  work for the first time it changed how he read/heard Creeley's work -  essentially, that Creeley's line was based on a setting out - on  beginnings (and so origins) - rather than endings and arrivings - about  the hard traveling rather than hitting a spot (touristic or otherwise).

  So, what is the aim of a reading - the roaring head - then?

  I also thought of listening to Clark Coolidge reading - that feeling of abdication - of letting go - listening.

  It's a common take that the contemporary attention span among the  educated per se is inside 18 minutes - that people form a qualitative  impression in about 3 seconds (which rarely diverges short term) -  while retention of what is read is usually minimal (a sentence or  phrase) - while mostly what people remember from a reading is what the  reader was wearing.

 In the late 1950's, TV executives  apochrapturously are said to have blocked out a plan to get America's  attention span inside 15 minutes - to about 13 minutes - in time for  the commercial.

 You can trick that "listening time" out by  the use of visual material, say, or through shifts of writing, assuming  they are sufficiently divergent, etc.

Is it about leaving the  listener hungry? Answer delays question but who is asking? Caring?  Feeling? Whose heart are we breaking - mind blowing? Where do words  end/begin? Where the tube to break and pipe through?

hi rodney,

so yre saying that if a poet tells stories or extended anecdotes during
their reading that these don't keep the reading time clock moving? what if
they give a two-minute introduction to a 30-second piece, does that go down
as 30 seconds or 2 minutes and 30 seconds? whenever i've given readings i
always thought the clock started at "hi" and ended at "thanks," whatever i
said in between.

one of the reasons i started this thread is that after i saw those segue
reading times and thought how long the poets were reading for i wondered
about time constraints at readings. i know that all the times i've been
asked to read, or asked others to read, there's always been a time limit
given. and when i'm given that time--be it three minutes at the poetry
project's new year's day marathon or two 20-minute sets at larry's in
columbus, ohio--i practice the reading ahead of time, including the
introductions, so that when i go up to read i fill the slot or go a bit
under.

to me there's nothing that show's more of a lack of professionalism or
respect for your audience than a poet who goes way long at a reading or
doesn't prepare sufficiently ahead of time. like those poets who leaf
through their notebooks at the podium to pick what to read, not usually
because they want to gauge the audience but because they don't have their
acts together. and i've never enjoyed it when a poet goes up there, picks a
piece out after thumbing through a pile of work, reads a few lines to
themselves, and then says, "nah, i'm not gonna read this one."

best,
david

with the time topic now well-traveled, what about constraints on
content???

and by the way i need some for a reading in a couple weeks, if anyone's
got some spare.

Bill,

some spare what?  constraints?  content?  time?

I remember in 1990 or so, my first reading at Ear Inn, I was asked to read
for 50 minutes or an hour. And when I first began to go to readings at
Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee in the early 1980's, usually there was just
one poet reading, and the readings went for an entire hour. I liked that .
. . still do. I think one can create a space in 40 minutes or more, with
multiple aspects of what one does as writer & reader present, can create a
kind of inviting whole that develops as it goes. That's much more difficult
to do with 20 minutes, where you pretty much step in and step out and hope
you hit something right. These days, when I'm the only reader on a program,
I usually think 40 minutes, or even a bit more. When there are two readers,
I try for 20 or 25 minutes. When there are three readers, I go on for 15
minutes, and certainly not more than 20. The exception is when the
presenter or host of a reading asks me to read for a specific length of
time, and I do my best to honor that within a minute or two, usually a
minute or two under what I am asked to do.

I am very glad that the first time I heard the Four Horsemen, Lyn Hejinian,
Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, Susan Howe, Ed Dorn, Allen Ginsberg, Anne
Waldman, Paul Metcalf, Pauline Oliveros, Charles Bernstein, Bernadette
Mayer, Jackson Mac Low, Ron Silliman, Gil Ott, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Karen
Mac Cormack, Bob Perelman, Joel Oppenheimer, Beverly Dahlen, bpNichol,
Kathleen Fraser, Myung Mi Kim, Steve McCaffery -- and many others (all on
different occasions) -- that they read for longer than 20 minutes, and
generally longer than 30 minutes.

I have no problem with thinking that average attention spans in general are
15 minutes or so, but I don't think the average attention spans of half or
more of the people that go to poetry readings are that short. And maybe
those that get the most out of the readings have a considerably longer
attention span that is being unfairly served by really short readings.
Aren't we reading to them, too?

And if it's really true that attention spans in general are that short,
then shouldn't jazz concerts and symphony concerts also be 20 minutes or
less? Maybe all movies should be 20 minutes or less.

I like to read for 40-60 minutes. It takes me 20-25 minutes just to warm up,
get my performance rhythm flowing and feel how responsive the audience is.
Most of the time when I read, I feel I have to stop just before I can kick
into high gear. It's not unlike a jazz performance; I usually disregard the
band's first set as a warm-up, unless they're having an unusually hot night.

Bill,

some spare what?  constraints?  content?  time?

I remember in 1990 or so, my first reading at Ear Inn, I was asked to read
for 50 minutes or an hour. And when I first began to go to readings at
Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee in the early 1980's, usually there was just
one poet reading, and the readings went for an entire hour. I liked that .
. . still do. I think one can create a space in 40 minutes or more, with
multiple aspects of what one does as writer & reader present, can create a
kind of inviting whole that develops as it goes. That's much more difficult
to do with 20 minutes, where you pretty much step in and step out and hope
you hit something right. These days, when I'm the only reader on a program,
I usually think 40 minutes, or even a bit more. When there are two readers,
I try for 20 or 25 minutes. When there are three readers, I go on for 15
minutes, and certainly not more than 20. The exception is when the
presenter or host of a reading asks me to read for a specific length of
time, and I do my best to honor that within a minute or two, usually a
minute or two under what I am asked to do.

I am very glad that the first time I heard the Four Horsemen, Lyn Hejinian,
Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, Susan Howe, Ed Dorn, Allen Ginsberg, Anne
Waldman, Paul Metcalf, Pauline Oliveros, Charles Bernstein, Bernadette
Mayer, Jackson Mac Low, Ron Silliman, Gil Ott, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Karen
Mac Cormack, Bob Perelman, Joel Oppenheimer, Beverly Dahlen, bpNichol,
Kathleen Fraser, Myung Mi Kim, Steve McCaffery -- and many others (all on

more of the people that go to poetry readings are that short. And maybe

I never heard Octavia Butler read, though she was reading here about the
time I was teaching her writing.  I really regret that.  It seems like she
was in poor health for a long time, and I wish she'd had more time to write
more.

As far as readings/content, I don't know -- I just wanted to mention here
that WOMPO was talking a while back about the evolution of readings,
lectures, performances and essentially what I ended up with out of the
conversation was the ghost of Victorian recitations I hear in Stein and
Pound, Amy Lowell's lecture / readings (wasn't she on the chatauqua (sp?)
circuit?, Vachel Lindsay's performances (Dylan Thomas, blurring the reading
/ performance line), the salons in the east village in the teens and 20s,
and the balls and parties surrounding the publication of a magazine or
fundraising for the publication of a magazine

"poet voice" readings being similar to the Victorian recitations; talk /
readings -- or even readings with lots of intro material -- is the intro
material marketing; performance; gang bang readings of 5-10 people (and in
my experience, out of 5-10 poets, there's somebody who has never timed
anything, and thinks 10 minutes is 10 poems); and -- a really lame open
mike? being like a salon?

Dear Poetics list- This is a little far fetched and I have done little
research about it, but I figured I would throw it out and see what the
response is... dialogue and such.

Anyway, I happened to think that maybe there was a relationship between the
experimentation of Dadaism and the experimentation done by Nazis on Jews
within the concentration camps. The foundation being that both occurred
within the same timetable and national identity. This is a rather disturbing
hypothesis, and I do not mean to be offensive. In addition, I am not trying
to say that Dadaism opened a gate for the experiments on Jews, rather I was
thinking it could be tied to a notion of repression. In other words, that
experimentation as a response to the modern world was something that could
not be completely eliminated, rather its repression and redirection against
the Jews happened. My pyschology background is shakey to say the least, but
I put this to the list because there might be an obvious blind spot to my
thinking.

Peace,
Ian VanHeusen

dadaism is wwi, not wwii --

you can look at vivisection and anti-vivisection in the UK and Europe at
the turn of the century as a precedent for nazi human "experimentation"
/ torture, as ongoing heresy "trials" and executions etc. is more of a
distant precedent -- lots of reformation-era atrocities in Prussia,
Austria-Hungary to research through

there's a lot of critical attention to this area now, and an interesting
relationship to women's suffrage, i.e., there is some indication that
women interested in women's rights first viewed slavery as a more
important evil to work against, and then, vivisection (which has some
interesting echoes with hysteria and women's health and "beauty
treatments"); you will probably find some interesting things about
vegetarianism... possibly even Hitler's...

New Experiments: Mary Burger on Telling Time

Burger writes: ?Narrative exists in the tension between disbelief and its
suspension. The seduction of narrative is that it creates an experience of
events in time, but that we are aware, in the midst of this experience, that
what we are experiencing is a representation. Narrative is not a window onto
the world, a transcription of an interior monologue, or a faithful account of
things as they happened, though it may assume any of these guises or others.
As participants in narrative, we have the power and the pleasure of being in
more than one place at one time?or, of being at more than one time in one
place?. Is narrative an engagement with events, or an enactment of events? Is
our understanding of time, of events taking place in time, separable from our
use of narrative to represent events in time? Or, are all of our
understandings of time ultimately instances of narrative??

Mary Burger is the author of Sonny (Leon Works) and a co-editor of Biting the
Error: Writers Explore Narrative (Coach House Books). She edits Second Story
Books, featuring works of experimental narrative. An Apparent Event , an
anthology of Second Story chapbooks, will be published in 2006.

There is a difference between words (thoughts) and deeds, between burning an
effigy and a body -though perhaps eliminating this distinction is a modern
poetic idea.

Over the weekend I got a chance to go to the Dada show at the National
Gallery of Art in DC (see http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/index.shtm). It's
an extraordinary show, and I'd recommend that any of you who can make it out
to see the show, do so! The show starts with the Zurich room, and there's a
pig/soldier hanging from the ceiling. Ian, you mentioned the connection
between Dada, Nazis & concentration camps... The Dada show highlights how
those visionary artists, musicians & poets created works which opposed
growing threats--mismanagement of technology, the military, and so on. The
Georg Grosz watercolors and lithographs are amazing & capture the horror of
what Grosz saw was happening in Germany. Many of those images painted during
and right after WWI hint at the tone in Germany that would led to the Nazis
taking over twenty or so years later.

The show has excellent films (such as one by Hans Richter) and audio
recordings (mostly from Sub Rosa's catalog, I think). Hannah Hoch's Dada
Dolls are remarkable. The Hannover room, which focuses mostly on Kurt
Schwitters, was my favorite part of the show. It's something else to hear
recordings of Schwitters' poetry while looking at his collages and other
artworks. Marcel Duchamp's "Rotary Glass Plates (Precision Optics)" is
amazing -- you can see it spin in its glass case and then you can go around
to the next room and see it spin from the other side.

There is a difference between words (thoughts) and deeds, between burning an

Ian,
Interesting thought! =20

Do I understand your supposition: that perhaps the mess of WWI and the =
presence of the Dadaist ideology/philosophy throughout Europe (if it can =
be called a philosophy) set the stage for the incredibly inhumane =
treatment of fellow humans by the Nazis some 20 years later.  =20

It's been a long time since I read any causes of WWII, but my aging =
memory cells seem to recall that one of the principal causes of WWII =
were the settlements upon Germany by the allies following WWI. =20

Might I infer then that there was similarly a cause and effect =
relationship between an art movement  of WWI and the inhumane activities =
by a select number of  Germans during WWII?   Might J. Mengles have been =
a Dadaist? Hmmmmmm....=20

I'll not dismiss your premise categorically, but I must say it's a =
stretch for me. =20

ian,
nazism and dada are  surely related, but i think you've got the genealogy
wrong. one didn't  father the other; they're step-siblings, or perhaps more like
cousins.  both were largely resultant of the thoughtless slaughter and
horrific suffering of wwi, sure. even so, their means of reaction to the  inhumanity
of the times differed so greatly that it's difficult to  argue a case for
causation. i mean, hitler generally despised modern  art...jewish, degenerate,
bourgeois, too difficult ;)...and dada's advocates  were socialists, commies,
anarchists, and subversives of various shades and  stripes.
also, it didn't really  happen in the "same national identity." dada was more
european than it was  exclusively german. french and swiss figures are no
less important than those of  german descent.
my 2  cents.

Octavia Butler, 1947-2006: Sci-fi writer a gifted pioneer in white, male
domain

By JOHN MARSHALL
P-I BOOK CRITIC

Her father was a shoeshine man who died when she was a child, her mother
was a maid who brought her along on jobs, yet Octavia Butler rose from
these humble beginnings to become one of the country's leading writers -
a female African American pioneer in the white, male domain of science
fiction.

Butler, 58, died after falling and striking her head Friday on a walkway
outside her home in Lake Forest Park. The reclusive writer, who moved to
Seattle in 1999 from her native Southern California, was a giant in
stature (she was 6 feet tall by age 15) and in accomplishment.


Joshua Trujillo / P-I
Octavia Butler was one of the Northwest's most prominent science fiction
writers.
She remains the only science fiction writer to receive one of the
vaunted "genius grants" from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation, a hard-earned $295,000 windfall in 1995 that followed years
of poverty and personal struggles with shyness and self-doubt.

"People may call these 'genius grants,' " Butler said in a 2004
interview with the Seattle P-I, "but nobody made me take an IQ test
before I got mine. I knew I'm no genius."

Butler's most popular work is "Kindred," a time-travel novel in which a
black woman from 1976 Southern California is transported back to the
violent days of slavery before the Civil War. The 1979 novel became a
popular staple of school and college courses and now has more than a
quarter million copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so
much in Butler's solitary life.

"Kindred" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of whom could not
understand how a science fiction novel could be set on a plantation in
the antebellum South. Butler stuck to her social justice vision - "I
think people really need to think what it's like to have all of society
arrayed against you" - and finally found a publisher who paid her a
$5,000 advance for "Kindred."

"I was living on my writing," Butler said, "and you could live on $5,000
back then. You could live, but not well. I got along by buying food I
didn't really like but was nourishing: beans, potatoes. A 10-pound sack
of potatoes lasts a long time."

Steven Barnes, another African American writer, knew Butler during her
early writing days in Southern California and later in the Washington
when he and his writer wife, Tananarive Due, lived for a time in
Longview before returning to Los Angeles. Barnes saw Butler's confidence
grow along with her reputation.

"Octavia was one of the purest writers I know," Barnes recalled Sunday.
"She put everything she had into her work - she was extraordinarily
committed to the craft. Yet, despite her shyness, she was also an open,
generous and humane human being. I miss her so much already."

Due added, "It is a cliche to say that she was too good a soul, but it's
true. What she really conveyed in her writing was the deep pain she felt
about the injustices around her. All of it was a metaphor for war,
poverty, power struggles and discrimination. All of that hurt her very
deeply, but her gift was that she could use words for the pain and make
the world better."

Due believed that Butler came to feel deeply at home in the Northwest
after she relocated here with 300 boxes of books. The anonymity of her
life in Seattle suited both her artistic devotion and temperament ("I
always felt a deep loneliness in her," Barnes said). But Butler did
become a frequent participant in readings and writers' conferences,
especially Clarion West, which played a crucial role in her own start.
She also served on the advisory board of Seattle's Science Fiction
Museum and Hall of Fame.

A few friends did get to see the relaxed Butler away from her infrequent
moments in the limelight, including Leslie Howle, who took her to see
the recent version of "King Kong." Howle describes the writer as "one of
the most fun people to be around, with an acerbic sense of humor and a
keen observer of human nature."

Butler was a confirmed non-driver who would chat with other bus
passengers or with neighbors who gave her rides when she trudged home
with bags of groceries, as neighbor Terry Morgan did.

"The first time I picked her up, she took me into her house and
autographed a copy of one of her books," Morgan said. "That was a great
'thank you,' especially since I am an African American and we felt a
common bond. But it was also obvious to me that writing was her life."

The MacArthur grant brought increasing visibility to Butler and allowed
her to buy her first house, where she tended to her ailing mother until
her death. (Butler's survivors are two elderly aunts and many cousins in
Southern California.)

But the MacArthur grant also brought daunting pressure. Three years
later, Butler published "Parable of Talents," winner of one of her two
Nebula Awards in science fiction. Then years passed without another new
novel, as projects in Seattle "petered out." Characters and ideas went
nowhere and her blood pressure medication left her drowsy and depressed.

The frustrated artist - who first turned to writing at 12 after the
sci-fi movie, "Devil Girl from Mars," convinced her that she could write
something better - battled worries that "maybe I cannot write anymore."

But at long last, an unlikely vampire novel rekindled her creative fires
and brought a burgeoning joy to her craft.

"I can't say I've had much fun in the last few years, what with my
version of writer's block," a relieved Butler recalled in 2004. "Writing
has been as difficult for me as for people who don't like to write and
as little fun. But now the well is filling up again with this vampire
novel."

Butler's death means that "Fledgling," published last fall to
enthusiastic praise, will likely stand as her final novel, to the great
disappointment to Butler's many fans and friends who expected more work.

"The only consolation in losing Octavia so soon," stressed Due, "is that
she must have known her place in history."

IN MEMORY OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE: DR. HUEY NEWTON, PH.D.
============================================================
[Col. Writ. 2/11/06] Copyright '06 Mumia Abu-Jamal

It is somehow fitting that February, the shortest month, has been
designated Black History Month. For whatever Black folks have gotten
from this country, it was given grudgingly, through gritted teeth, if
at all.

It was in February, 1942, when Huey P. Newton was born, in Oak Grove,
Louisiana, the youngest of seven children. He was named after
Louisiana Governor, Huey Long, a man regarded as a Populist.

But Huey's family would leave the state, and settle in Oakland,
California, where Huey would make his own name.

He was the co-founder, with Bobby Seale, of the Black Panther Party
[for Self-Defense], which rose to become of the most advanced Black
revolutionary organizations of the 1960s and '70s.

It grew into a national organization, with 44 chapters and branches
all across America; from West, to Midwest; from Boston, to Baton Rouge.

Huey, although poorly educated in Oakland schools, would push himself
to learn about the world around him, and through the Party, would teach
an entire generation about a world bubbling with revolutionary
discontent.

The Party, inspired by Black freedom struggles in the Deep South,
tried to put into practice the revolutionary teachings of Malcolm X, who
preached self-defense. Because it was always growing and changing,
party members studied his writings, as well as the works of China's Mao
Tse-Tung, Cuba's 'Che' Guevara, and the writings of Franz Fanon, who
helped in Algeria's revolution against France.

Huey's revolutionary influence would help the Party grow into the tens
of thousands; but, his growing paranoia, fed by the FBI, would also
cause the Party to down-size, as Panthers came from as far away as
Philadelphia, to help the Party during its electoral phase, when Seale
ran for Oakland's mayor, and other leading people ran for city council
seats.

Given his revolutionary ideas, and his uncompromising opposition to
the capitalist State, don't expect any U.S. Postal Service commemorative
stamps anytime soon. Nor will you ever see any U.S. presidents attend
any of his memorials.

Huey would be just fine with that. His life's work, the Party, was
designed to give a voice to the poor and oppressed, not the well-to-do
nor the high-born!

He wasn't a civil rights activist -- he was a revolutionary, who
wanted to totally transform American social reality.

His life, and his ignoble death, at the hands of a drug dealer, is
detailed in half a dozen books (including one of my own), but he
remains
a symbol of resistance to racist police terror, and the determination
of
a people to defend themselves.

That his name and his life isn't better known is a tribute to the very
forces that he fought against, and that the Party fought against. The
Black bourgeoisie and the rulers, who wanted Black youth to be as
uninformed about the centuries-long Black Freedom struggle as
possible.

Perhaps, if he were alive today, and 64 years old, he would be baffled
at how bleak and sour Black life has become for millions of his
people. But, maybe not.

He was a man of unusual brilliance, who saw deeply into how societies
work. His books, like 'Revolutionary Suicide' (1973), 'To Die for the
People' (1973), 'War Against the Panthers' (1996), and the
compilation, 'The Huey P. Newton Reader' (2002) betray the workings of a
first-rate
mind on a wide range of social and political issues.

He may not be remembered by the rulers or the rich, but he will not be
forgotten by the poor and the impoverished.

He will be remembered because the same ugly reality facing his
generation face Black young people today, and history exists to teach
us of our present.

He was 24 years old when he made a vast, and deep, contribution to
Black freedom and dignity. He didn't bow, and he didn't beg.

He stood up, and fought back, and urged others to stand with him.
Thousands did so.

They will do so again.

i have to say i'm shocked by this.  dada, like surrealism, was a bottom-up
uprising against the institutionalization--of art, life, the university,
criticism...--which enabled the horror of ww1 to take place.  that they
didn't succeed in shifting the wheels of the warmaking machine doesn't
mean they were responsible for the atrocities that followed.  as far as i
can make out, they didn't want to allow "business as usual" to succeed the
slaughters of the war.  gabe

I agree with Murat, longer readings create an entirely different voice on the material spun out, it is why I like to read lengthy. And the expectations are longer in the midwest, for every University reading I have given out here 40-45 minutes is the norm. There is a rush in reading to a few hundred people in an isolated college for two plus hours with one break and only losing a handful of people. But then again, maybe reading a one word poem would be nice next time.

No doubt Mr VanHeusen would also understand Galileo's experimentation
as having brought about the Spanish Inquisition?

"Galileo may have devised these experiments for two reasons. They were
initiated during a time in Galileo's life when he was interested in the
nature of falling bodies. Some students will recall the story of Galileo's
claim that in a vacuum a cannonball and a feather, both dropped from the
same height, would hit the floor at the same time. With the observational
data available at that time, you can imagine the reception that idea
received! In fact, Galileo was brought before the Spanish Inquisition and
forced to say his ideas were wrong, then put under house arrest in his
villa. In any case, one reason for these particular experiments may have
been to provide evidence for Galileo's restricted inertial concept. While he
had not formally declared that motion once imparted would remain uniform in
speed, this experiment could provide such evidence. Another reason may have
been to study the independent composition of two different motions
(horizontal, imparted velocity and vertical velocity due to gravity)."

Dear Geoffrey Gatza,

I will be in NYC and Western Mass during 18 March -
early April, and then am returning to China till June,
whereby I'll return to those Tibetan refugee filled
hill stations on other side of Himalayas (in India).
I'd love to read somewhere in Buffalo, as that's where
RC used to teach and read. You offered to assist me in
finding a place to read and, so, here's the query: Can
you? I'll take a bus and get there, drinks on me, lots
of stories, and plenty of good and bad news!

Forgive my inconsistency, as it's usually the drink.
Too, 8 years away from 'polite society' Stateside.

Alex

linking dada's experiments with the nazi's reminds me not so much of a

The whole issue of Dada as a precursor to Fascism is extremely silly
(it originated precisely as a protest against WW1) -- though at the
same time it's worth noting that Ezra Pound was on the fringes of
Paris Dada (see his "Kongo Roux" visual poem) and was friends with
Francis Picabia and (interestingly) Surrealist Rene Crevel, and the
Italian Julius Evola, who had a connection with the movement, became
an ideological inspiration of the far-right movement in his country
and elsewhere.  Plus, Hugo Ball, one of Dada's founders, was not above
anti-Semitic remarks in his "Critique of German Intelligence."

But German Dadaism, the most overtly revolutionary wing of the
movement, was uncompromisingly anti-Fascist (true, the Herzfeld
brothers became Stalinists later in life).  As for Marcel Janco's
founding an artists colony in Israel called Ein Hod, there has been
some controversy among the descendants of, shall we say, the original
residents (those  Mr. Nudel describes in soemwhat avian or
entomological terms as "scrabbling") who were displaced from the area
so that M. Janco could build his swimming pool (with all the prodigal
use of scarce water resources that implies).

Lurching out of lurk for a moment...am reading an interesting book
called "Conversations: The Autobiography of Surrealism" (Editions
Gallimard, 1969, Tr: Mark Polizzoti) in which Andre Breton discusses
the link between Dada and surrealism, the post WW1 context of Dada
and its eventual breakdown. Breton, himself, broke with Dada in 1924
due in part to what he refers to as Dada's isolationist practices and
farcical public demonstrations. He got more involved in automatic
writing, Freudian analysis and eventually, surrealism.

The most back-channeled response I've ever gotten from
a post on Buffalo List.  Yeah well, hmm, if I'm still alive
in another 20 years I'll do a sit-in.

I'm sure by then the cosmetic industry will be much MUCH
freakier than it is today.  To the point that I'm sure those
of us doing the sit-in LOVE-IN smooching by the zapping
of whatever it is that's zapping the wrinkles out of them
we'll be the only authentic oldies around.

Maybe by then age will be so hidden there will be a new
campaign to Out the old folks.  I'll maintain the website
for the group, and of course the website will take existing
photos and age them so we can see what folks would
look like if they were natural.

thanks for bringing up all these things....

One thing that hasn't been mentioned in this discussion
is the question of what is often called FAILING EYESIGHT--

Ya know, while some say 'rage rage against the dying of the light,"
maybe part of the issue isn't just the cosmetic industry
but the equally UNNATURAL insistence on 20/20 vision as a standard
with age, maybe there's a quite natural "logic" to "failing eyesight"
and that, if embraced, cosmetics would also become more superfluous....
(hope this doesn't sound like blaming dada for hitler....)

Friends,



This Thursday's reading will be one of the highlights of the season. Not
only will William Fuller and John Tipton be in the house, but their
publisher, Devin Johnston, will emcee. I hope there will be time for a bit
of Q&A afterward. Please try to attend!

William Fuller is the author of Sadly (Flood Editions, 2003), byt (O Books,
1989), The Sugar Borders (O Books, 1993) and Aether (GAZ, 1998), and others.
The Chicago Tribune has referred to Fuller's "dense, elliptical meditations"
with "luminous images that consistently marry the cerebral and the sensual."
His new book, Watchword, will be published by Flood Editions in June of
2006.  He lives in Winnetka, Illinois.



John Tipton had an itinerant childhood in Indiana, Florida, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, and Illinois. After a three-year stint in the U.S. Army, he
attended the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill and earned an AB in
philosophy. His first book-length collection of poetry, Surfaces, was
published by Flood Editions in 2004. He currently lives in Chicago where he
curates the Chicago Poetry Project, a series of readings at the Chicago
Public Library. He has recently completed a translation of "Ajax" by
Sophocles.





Flood Editions titles will be made available for purchase at the reading, at

alex--
this vision of the poetry world repulses me.
my poetry world often encompasses politeness, friendliness, all else you
refute.
the less-"significant" poets in life sometimes are so much more memorable
after death, the "great" sometimes are forgotten.
chicken littles, prostrate, denuded. (castration complex?)
i strongly suspect "our best" would be very different from poet to  poet.
and who cares anyway?
licking your chops for what?
best, shmest.
for me, poetry is enough.

grateful to be aware of a different poetry world--

There's a vaccuum. With Creeley's death, something big
was  lost. Tone. I hear people quoting the words of
second-string ballplayers.  All those chicken littles
don't understand they's prostrate yesterday  and
denuded 1 hr ago. You are a reading away from nobody.
Best some of  us start licking our chops. This aint no
democracy, and it aint polite, and  it friendly, nor
liberal, nor open minded, but rather is  the
understanding that there needs to be a place that
represents our  best.

>>
>> ''She stands alone for what she did,'' Howle said. ''She was such a

>> and a light in that way.''
>>
>> Jane Jewell, executive director of the Science Fiction and Fantasy
>> Writers=3D
> =3D20

>>
>> Butler began writing at age 10, and told Howle she embraced science=3D20

>> Seattle science fiction author Octavia Butler dies at 58
>> Sunday, February 26, 2006
>>
>> By JOHN MARSHALL
>> P-I BOOK CRITIC
>>
>> Her father was a shoeshine man who died when she was a
>> child, her mother was a maid who brought her along on jobs,
>> yet Octavia Butler rose from these humble beginnings to
>> become one of the country's leading writers - a female
>> African American pioneer in the white, male domain of
>> science fiction.
>>
>> Butler, 58, died after falling and striking her head Friday
>> on a walkway outside her home in Lake Forest Park. The
>> reclusive writer, who moved to Seattle in 1999 from her
>> native Southern California, was a giant in stature (she
>> reached 6 foot by age 15) and in accomplishment.
>>
>> She remains the only science fiction writer to receive one
>> of the vaunted "genius grants" from the John D. and
>> Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, a hard-earned $295,000
>> windfall in 1995 that followed years of poverty and personal
>> struggles with shyness and self-doubt.
>>
>> "People may call these 'genius grants,' " Butler said in a
>> 2004 interview with the Seattle P-I, "but nobody made me
>> take an IQ test before I got mine. I knew I'm no genius."
>>
>> Butler's most popular work is "Kindred," a time-travel novel
>> in which a black woman from 1976 Southern California is
>> transported back to the violent days of slavery before the
>> Civil War. The 1979 novel became a popular staple of school
>> and college courses and now has more than a quarter million
>> copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so much
>> in Butler's solitary life.
>>
>> "Kindred" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of
>> whom could not understand how a science fiction novel could
>> be set on a plantation in the antebellum South. Butler stuck
>> to her social justice vision - "I think people really need
>> to think what it's like to have all of society arrayed
>> against you" - and finally found a publisher who paid her a
>> $5,000 advance for "Kindred."
>>
>> "I was living on my writing," Butler said, "and you could
>> live on $5,000 back then. You could live, but not well. I
>> got along by buying food I didn't really like but was
>> nourishing: beans, potatoes. A 10-pound sack of potatoes
>> lasts a long time."
>>
>> Steven Barnes, another African American writer, knew Butler
>> during her early writing days in Southern California and
>> later in the Washington when he and his writer wife,
>> Tananarive Due, lived for a time in Longview before
>> returning to Los Angeles. Barnes saw Butler's confidence
>> grow along with her reputation.
>>
>> "Octavia was one of the purest writers I know," Barnes
>> recalled Sunday. "She put everything she had into her work -
>> she was extraordinarily committed to the craft. Yet, despite
>> her shyness, she was also an open, generous and humane human
>> being. I miss her so much already."
>>
>> Due added, "It is a clich=3DE9 to say that she was too good a
>> soul, but it's true. What she really conveyed in her writing
>> was the deep pain she felt about the injustices around her.
>> All of it was a metaphor for war, poverty, power struggles
>> and discrimination. All of that hurt her very deeply, but
>> her gift was that she could use words for the pain and make
>> the world better."
>>
>> Due believed that Butler came to feel deeply at home in the
>> Northwest after she relocated here with 300 boxes of books.
>> The anonymity of her life in Seattle suited both her
>> artistic devotion and temperament ("I always felt a deep
>> loneliness in her," Barnes said). But Butler did become a
>> frequent participant in readings and writers' conferences,
>> especially Clarion West, which played a crucial role in her
>> own start. She also served on the advisory board of Seattle's
>> Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.
>>
>> A few friends did get to see the relaxed Butler away from
>> her infrequent moments in the limelight, including Leslie
>> Howle, who took her to see the recent version of "King
>> Kong." Howle describes the writer as "one of the most fun
>> people to be around, with an acerbic sense of humor and a
>> keen observer of human nature."
>>
>> Butler was a confirmed non-driver who would chat with other
>> bus passengers or with neighbors who gave her rides when she
>> trudged home with bags of groceries, as Terry Morgan did.
>>
>> "The first time I picked her up, she took me into her house
>> and autographed a copy of one of her books," Morgan said.
>> "That was a great 'thank you,' especially since I am an
>> African American and we felt a common bond. But it was also
>> obvious to me that writing was her life."
>>
>> The MacArthur grant brought increasing visibility to Butler
>> and allowed her to buy her first house, where she tended to
>> her ailing mother until her death. (Butler's own survivors
>> are two elderly aunts and many cousins in Southern
>> California.)

>>>
>>> "People may call these 'genius grants,' " Butler said in a
>>> 2004 interview with the Seattle P-I, "but nobody made me
>>> take an IQ test before I got mine. I knew I'm no genius."
>>>
>>> Butler's most popular work is "Kindred," a time-travel novel
>>> in which a black woman from 1976 Southern California is
>>> transported back to the violent days of slavery before the
>>> Civil War. The 1979 novel became a popular staple of school
>>> and college courses and now has more than a quarter million
>>> copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so much
>>> in Butler's solitary life.
>>>
>>> "Kindred" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of
>>> whom could not understand how a science fiction novel could
>>> be set on a plantation in the antebellum South. Butler stuck
>>> to her social justice vision - "I think people really need
>>> to think what it's like to have all of society arrayed
>>> against you" - and finally found a publisher who paid her a
>>> $5,000 advance for "Kindred."
>>>
>>> "I was living on my writing," Butler said, "and you could
>>> live on $5,000 back then. You could live, but not well. I
>>> got along by buying food I didn't really like but was
>>> nourishing: beans, potatoes. A 10-pound sack of potatoes
>>> lasts a long time."
>>>
>>> Steven Barnes, another African American writer, knew Butler
>>> during her early writing days in Southern California and
>>> later in the Washington when he and his writer wife,
>>> Tananarive Due, lived for a time in Longview before
>>> returning to Los Angeles. Barnes saw Butler's confidence
>>> grow along with her reputation.
>>>
>>> "Octavia was one of the purest writers I know," Barnes
>>> recalled Sunday. "She put everything she had into her work -
>>> she was extraordinarily committed to the craft. Yet, despite
>>> her shyness, she was also an open, generous and humane human
>>> being. I miss her so much already."
>>>
>>> Due added, "It is a clich=3DE9 to say that she was too good a
>>> soul, but it's true. What she really conveyed in her writing
>>> was the deep pain she felt about the injustices around her.
>>> All of it was a metaphor for war, poverty, power struggles
>>> and discrimination. All of that hurt her very deeply, but
>>> her gift was that she could use words for the pain and make
>>> the world better."
>>>
>>> Due believed that Butler came to feel deeply at home in the
>>> Northwest after she relocated here with 300 boxes of books.
>>> The anonymity of her life in Seattle suited both her
>>> artistic devotion and temperament ("I always felt a deep
>>> loneliness in her," Barnes said). But Butler did become a
>>> frequent participant in readings and writers' conferences,
>>> especially Clarion West, which played a crucial role in her
>>> own start. She also served on the advisory board of Seattle's
>>> Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.
>>>
>>> A few friends did get to see the relaxed Butler away from
>>> her infrequent moments in the limelight, including Leslie
>>> Howle, who took her to see the recent version of "King
>>> Kong." Howle describes the writer as "one of the most fun
>>> people to be around, with an acerbic sense of humor and a
>>> keen observer of human nature."
>>>
>>> Butler was a confirmed non-driver who would chat with other
>>> bus passengers or with neighbors who gave her rides when she
>>> trudged home with bags of groceries, as Terry Morgan did.
>>>
>>> "The first time I picked her up, she took me into her house
>>> and autographed a copy of one of her books," Morgan said.
>>> "That was a great 'thank you,' especially since I am an
>>> African American and we felt a common bond. But it was also
>>> obvious to me that writing was her life."
>>>
>>> The MacArthur grant brought increasing visibility to Butler
>>> and allowed her to buy her first house, where she tended to
>>> her ailing mother until her death. (Butler's own survivors
>>> are two elderly aunts and many cousins in Southern
>>> California.)
>>>
>>> But the MacArthur grant also brought daunting pressure.

Friends,



This Thursday's reading will be one of the highlights of the season. Not
only will William Fuller and John Tipton be in the house, but their
publisher, Devin Johnston, will emcee. I hope there will be time for a bit
of Q&A afterward. Please try to attend!

William Fuller is the author of Sadly (Flood Editions, 2003), byt (O Books,
1989), The Sugar Borders (O Books, 1993) and Aether (GAZ, 1998), and others.
The Chicago Tribune has referred to Fuller's "dense, elliptical meditations"
with "luminous images that consistently marry the cerebral and the sensual."
His new book, Watchword, will be published by Flood Editions in June of
2006.  He lives in Winnetka, Illinois.



John Tipton had an itinerant childhood in Indiana, Florida, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, and Illinois. After a three-year stint in the U.S. Army, he
attended the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill and earned an AB in
philosophy. His first book-length collection of poetry, Surfaces, was
published by Flood Editions in 2004. He currently lives in Chicago where he
curates the Chicago Poetry Project, a series of readings at the Chicago
Public Library. He has recently completed a translation of "Ajax" by
Sophocles.





Flood Editions titles will be made available for purchase at the reading, at
a discount. Please pass this message along to anyone who might be
interested!

Best does not matter.

Often the poet with the best marketing and the most friends gets published
sooner than the truly talented poet.

Look at Kazim Ali who had to wait how many years to get a book out? In terms
of Politeness and Friendliness I would love to see people be polite, civil
and engaged and also free to speak the truth if a book or poem needs to be
critiqued why not?

alex--
this vision of the poetry world repulses me.
my poetry world often encompasses politeness, friendliness, all else you
refute.
the less-"significant" poets in life sometimes are so much more memorable
after death, the "great" sometimes are forgotten.
chicken littles, prostrate, denuded. (castration complex?) i strongly
suspect "our best" would be very different from poet to  poet.
and who cares anyway?
licking your chops for what?
best, shmest.
for me, poetry is enough.

There's a vaccuum. With Creeley's death, something big was  lost. Tone. I
hear people quoting the words of second-string ballplayers.  All those
chicken littles don't understand they's prostrate yesterday  and denuded 1
hr ago. You are a reading away from nobody.
Best some of  us start licking our chops. This aint no democracy, and it
aint polite, and  it friendly, nor liberal, nor open minded, but rather is
the understanding that there needs to be a place that represents our  best.

Well said.

I've noticed that this issue seems to resurface on the list
in various guises around academy awards time every year.

Nothing gets me more depressed than endless
paeans to "the best."

Hopefully Jon Stuart will surface some of the ridiculous aspects
of this sort of thing on Sunday.

Octavia Butler, 1947-2006: Sci-fi writer a gifted pioneer in white, male
domain


Butler's most popular work is "Kindred," a time-travel novel in which a
black woman from 1976 Southern California is transported back to the
violent days of slavery before the Civil War. The 1979 novel became a
popular staple of school and college courses and now has more than a
quarter million copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so
much in Butler's solitary life.

Octavia Butler, 1947-2006: Sci-fi writer a gifted pioneer in white, male
domain

By JOHN MARSHALL
P-I BOOK CRITIC

Her father was a shoeshine man who died when she was a child, her mother
was a maid who brought her along on jobs, yet Octavia Butler rose from
these humble beginnings to become one of the country's leading writers -
a female African American pioneer in the white, male domain of science
fiction.

Butler, 58, died after falling and striking her head Friday on a walkway
outside her home in Lake Forest Park. The reclusive writer, who moved to
Seattle in 1999 from her native Southern California, was a giant in
stature (she was 6 feet tall by age 15) and in accomplishment.


Joshua Trujillo / P-I
Octavia Butler was one of the Northwest's most prominent science fiction
writers.
She remains the only science fiction writer to receive one of the
vaunted "genius grants" from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation, a hard-earned $295,000 windfall in 1995 that followed years
of poverty and personal struggles with shyness and self-doubt.

"People may call these 'genius grants,' " Butler said in a 2004
interview with the Seattle P-I, "but nobody made me take an IQ test
before I got mine. I knew I'm no genius."

Butler's most popular work is "Kindred," a time-travel novel in which a
black woman from 1976 Southern California is transported back to the
violent days of slavery before the Civil War. The 1979 novel became a
popular staple of school and college courses and now has more than a
quarter million copies in print, but its birth was agonizing, like so
much in Butler's solitary life.

"Kindred" was repeatedly rejected by publishers, many of whom could not
understand how a science fiction novel could be set on a plantation in
the antebellum South. Butler stuck to her social justice vision - "I
think people really need to think what it's like to have all of society
arrayed against you" - and finally found a publisher who paid her a
$5,000 advance for "Kindred."

"I was living on my writing," Butler said, "and you could live on $5,000
back then. You could live, but not well. I got along by buying food I
didn't really like but was nourishing: beans, potatoes. A 10-pound sack
of potatoes lasts a long time."

Steven Barnes, another African American writer, knew Butler during her
early writing days in Southern California and later in the Washington
when he and his writer wife, Tananarive Due, lived for a time in
Longview before returning to Los Angeles. Barnes saw Butler's confidence
grow along with her reputation.

"Octavia was one of the purest writers I know," Barnes recalled Sunday.
"She put everything she had into her work - she was extraordinarily
committed to the craft. Yet, despite her shyness, she was also an open,
generous and humane human being. I miss her so much already."

Due added, "It is a cliche to say that she was too good a soul, but it's
true. What she really conveyed in her writing was the deep pain she felt
about the injustices around her. All of it was a metaphor for war,
poverty, power struggles and discrimination. All of that hurt her very
deeply, but her gift was that she could use words for the pain and make
the world better."

Due believed that Butler came to feel deeply at home in the Northwest
after she relocated here with 300 boxes of books. The anonymity of her
life in Seattle suited both her artistic devotion and temperament ("I
always felt a deep loneliness in her," Barnes said). But Butler did
become a frequent participant in readings and writers' conferences,
especially Clarion West, which played a crucial role in her own start.
She also served on the advisory board of Seattle's Science Fiction
Museum and Hall of Fame.

A few friends did get to see the relaxed Butler away from her infrequent
moments in the limelight, including Leslie Howle, who took her to see
the recent version of "King Kong." Howle describes the writer as "one of
the most fun people to be around, with an acerbic sense of humor and a
keen observer of human nature."

Butler was a confirmed non-driver who would chat with other bus
passengers or with neighbors who gave her rides when she trudged home
with bags of groceries, as neighbor Terry Morgan did.

"The first time I picked her up, she took me into her house and
autographed a copy of one of her books," Morgan said. "That was a great
'thank you,' especially since I am an African American and we felt a
common bond. But it was also obvious to me that writing was her life."

The MacArthur grant brought increasing visibility to Butler and allowed
her to buy her first house, where she tended to her ailing mother until
her death. (Butler's survivors are two elderly aunts and many cousins in
Southern California.)

But the MacArthur grant also brought daunting pressure. Three years
later, Butler published "Parable of Talents," winner of one of her two
Nebula Awards in science fiction. Then years passed without another new
novel, as projects in Seattle "petered out." Characters and ideas went
nowhere and her blood pressure medication left her drowsy and depressed.

The frustrated artist - who first turned to writing at 12 after the
sci-fi movie, "Devil Girl from Mars," convinced her that she could write
something better - battled worries that "maybe I cannot write anymore."

But at long last, an unlikely vampire novel rekindled her creative fires
and brought a burgeoning joy to her craft.

"I can't say I've had much fun in the last few years, what with my
version of writer's block," a relieved Butler recalled in 2004. "Writing
has been as difficult for me as for people who don't like to write and
as little fun. But now the well is filling up again with this vampire
novel."

Butler's death means that "Fledgling," published last fall to
enthusiastic praise, will likely stand as her final novel, to the great
disappointment to Butler's many fans and friends who expected more work.

"The only consolation in losing Octavia so soon," stressed Due, "is that
she must have known her place in history."

Dana Franklin, a modern day African-American woman, is ripped violently
and suddenly back in time to an era in which freedom and human dignity
were often determined by the color of one's skin. In order to save her
family, she must find a way to survive amidst the horrors of slavery in
America's pre-Civil War South.

Award-winning actors Alfre Woodard, Lynn Whitfield and Ruby Dee star in
this audio drama adaptation of Octavia E. Butler's landmark science
fiction novel. This ambitious and moving four-part Seeing Ear Theatre
miniseries premieres in conjunction with Black History Month exclusively

We have a "the Tap Room" in Providence too.  I thought maybe you were up =
here organizing readings, Aaron.  Chris asked about worst readings =
recently.  I don't know about worst but I have been conscious sometimes =
that the poems didn't work well with the venue.  This can be a little =
scary, i.e., say if your poems don't perform very well in the sort of =
venue you're comfortable in, e.g., beautiful high-ceilinged rooms with =
chandeliers in well-kept colleges, and instead want to perform in low-down =
basement bars where the curator passes around a tin can & delivers $42.37 =
to you at the end of the night --- the sort of venue you yourself are a =
little uneasy in but your poems are beginning to insist upon?  Has that =
sort of separation of poem & poet happened to you guys?

Mussolini had some sort of affiliation with Italian Futurism. And some
people within Italian Futurism (which is different from Russian Futurism)
were quite enamored of the machine and had high hopes concerning
technological progress and the place of art and artists in a new society.
Which turned out eventually to be Mussolini's Italy, perhaps eventually to
their dismay. But I have never read of Dada being so overtly related to
fascism. Then again, I'm not a scholar on the matter.

Regardless of whether poet innovators and their inventions are initially
allied with the forces of darkness, their insights will be exploited. I'm
under the impression that the typographic innovations of both Dada and
Futurism were (relatively) quickly exploited in newspapers and magazines,
for instance. Perhaps the same can be said, as you seem to imply, concerning
their approach to sound poetry and politicians' approaches to public
performance.

But no connection between innovators/inventions and those who use the
inventions is required for invention to be exploited. All that is required
to exploit an insight in an understanding of its relevance to one's purpose.

And that the Nazis experimented on people and the artists experimented with
language etc is among the most tenuous of connections, it seems to me.

And as for concrete causing a retreat of the spoken word, boring it back
onto the page, that seems unlikely to me. The relations, for instance,
between visual poetry and sound poetry are obvious, and the vectors of
experimental work such as concrete point outward from the page into other
media and arts; not retreat, but advance through all the dimensions of
language.

One of my favorite Allan Ginsberg works is his setting, and singing,
of Blake's Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, which I
learned by heart when the record came out in 1969.

Thanks to the Allen Ginsberg Trust (http://www.allenginsberg.org),
and Bob Rosenthal, PennSound is pleased to make these recordings available:

As you will see, we have linked the songs to the illuminated texts.

Correction: That last posting for the Discrete Series should have listed the
date for this event as March 3.

Sorry for the confusion.

That's fantastic news. I've always wanted access to the complete
recordings. I did hear him perform
Some of them, and have one or two selections from records albums--any
excuse I have to play the Nurse's Song in the classroom I take. And I
agree, they are among my favourite Ginsberg things of all time.
