Subject:      Support the VERSeFest '13 : Indiegogo campaign!

VERSeFest 13, Ottawa's annual international poetry festival, starts on 12
March. We need your help to make the festival even better than last year!

VERSeFest is Ottawas annual international poetry festival.  It is managed
by a collective of Ottawa poetry groups called VERSe Ottawa.  The festival
is going into its third year and has been a great artistic success.  Last
year's festival brought spoken word poets of the calibre of C.R. Avery and
Ursula Rucker, and written word poets such as Philip Levine and Rae
Armantrout.  We're looking forward to VERSeFest 13, which will feature
poets from Australia, Ireland and the Netherlands.  The festival promises
to be even better than its predecessors.  But we need your help.

Staging an international poetry festival is a much more expensive
operation than keeping it Canadian.  Travel costs are very much higher, as
you might imagine; even the costs of accommodation and hospitality rise
above those for Canadian nationals.  We have sought and obtained some
funding from several Canadian funding agencies, but it isn't enough to
offset costs.

We need $5,000 to break even on VERSeFest 13.  If we don't manage to raise
that amount, we will have to start cancelling international and Canadian
poets.  We need $2,500 to bring two Irish and three Dutch poets to Ottawa,
and we need $1,500 to bring Canadian poets from western Canada.  A further
$1,000 will go toward accommodations and hospitality for other festival
participants.

Your contributions will go directly to funding the artists appearances.
VERSeFest is run completely by volunteers, so 100% of every donation goes
toward making the festival happen.  Please give what you can.

http://www.indiegogo.com/versefest/x/2291088

You can help even if you cant contribute financially.  Please pass the
word about our campaign to friends and acquaintances.  Make some noise
about VERSeFest and Indiegogo.  Use the Indiegogo share tools to get the
word out.

Thank you!

1. COLLECTED POEMS, JOSEPH CERAVOLO, (Wesleyan University Press, 2013). The=
 late Joseph Ceravolo (1934-1988) has only posthumously begun receiving his=
 due as a contemporary Master. One of the many postwar Greats largely resid=
ent in one of the nation's two elite coastal literary enclaves--Ceravolo li=
ved and wrote in and around New York City for most of his career--Ceravolo,=
 like many avant-garde geniuses until recently excluded from institution-dr=
iven public canonization, has been the beneficiary of the renewed interest =
in late twentieth century experimental writing produced by the Program Era,=
 which interest also explains the historic expansion in independent literar=
y publishing over the same time period. (It is worth noting, too, that Cera=
volo was one of the nation's early-adopter creative writing students, havin=
g studied under the illustrious Kenneth Koch at The New School in the 1950s=
, years before even two terminal-degree graduate creative writing programs =
dotted the American landscape.) The poet's distinctive style consists of th=
e sort of raw ellipticism that children, so better attuned than their elder=
s to the associative rangings of the mind, produce naturally and in great v=
olume. If there is a precursor to the current tendency, among younger poets=
, to produce verse that feels more emotionally exacting than it semanticall=
y has any right to be, that is gleefully intuitive rather than bleakly meth=
odical, it is Ceravolo.=20

The late Koch once implied that Ceravolo's writing was, in some form or ano=
ther, a mystical enterprise, and others have associated it more directly wi=
th the Dadaism and Surrealism of the early-twentieth century European avant=
-garde. However well-intentioned this praise--and in the vernacular of the =
shrewd, simultaneously anti- and pro-canonmaking doublespeak of the America=
n avant-garde, any praise that seeks to deduce or manufacture a nexus betwe=
en tradition and an individual talent is at least nominally well-intentione=
d--it misses the mark. What Ceravolo (a shy family man from New Jersey in h=
is personal life) reveals in his work is that the natural processes of the =
human mind, channeled reflexively and lovingly through the prism of receive=
d language, are glorious and magical in situ--it does not require readers' =
imagination or whimsy to make them so. To call a thing mystical is to (ofte=
n unfairly) position it as an irreducible and irreplicable eccentricity; it=
 is no slight to Ceravolo to say that his distinctive writing style does no=
t so much denominate a distinctive thinking style as constitute a revelatio=
n and celebration of what are already, in fact, universal phenomena.=20

The literary-arts pedagogy of the poet Charles Bernstein, referred to by th=
e Philadelphia-dwelling author and educator as "creative wreading" (an amal=
gam of "creative writing" and "creative reading") encourages writers and re=
aders alike to locate and reside in those elements of a poem that appear qu=
ote-unquote "wrong," cause consternation, disrupt expectations, and produce=
 what Bernstein terms a "non-absorptive" (that is, difficult to parse using=
 received expectations of/for language) reading experience. The theory behi=
nd such readings is not merely that these eddies of strangeness are the mos=
t interesting bits in the texts in which they appear, though this is presum=
ptively true under the pedagogy, but also that they constitute more authent=
ic representations of the false starts and misfires of the brain that in fa=
ct plague (or, as you like, bless) each one of us daily. Bernstein's point =
is one Ceravolo long ago internalized and exhibited in his body of work. In=
deed, while there is much talk today of "voice" and "authenticity" in poetr=
y, in fact "voice"--as Collected Poems reveals--is merely an elective const=
ruction traceably comprised of semi-discrete principles like grammar, dicti=
on, tone, syntax, parataxis, juxtaposition, ethos, logos, and pathos, and a=
uthenticity is always to be found in compositional process rather than prod=
uct. In other words, we needn't force these things; we merely need attune o=
urselves to "hear" our native skill-set and then determine how and why and =
where this psychic know-how corresponds to anything operative in the world.=
=20

Ceravolo is, in this view, as authentic and vocally distinctive a poet as w=
e have, despite the fact that his poems often cannot be read or heard the w=
ay everyday speech is heard or processed--and that no one but Ceravolo coul=
d know or say whether the poet had expressed his sentiments "authentically"=
 (that is, in fidelity to the form and nature of their source stimuli withi=
n and without the poet himself). Scholars may coo over the prospect of addi=
ng Ceravolo's voice to the already robust gallery of personalities associat=
ed with the so-called "New York School"; the rest of us will find in the po=
etry a sensitivity to instinctive association that is no more particular to=
 New York City than a French baguette, no more exclusive to the aesthetic s=
ensibilities of the New York School poets (who, after all, are far more cre=
dibly associated biographically than artistically) than the line or stanza =
was to the Romantics.

The best American poetry--and Ceravolo contributes substantially to the sto=
ck of verse deserving of this honorific--can often be read as an additive e=
quation in which only the first and resultant terms are available to the re=
ader; the middle terms, the ones added to the first to produce the final re=
sult, are usually elided. And it is in these absent terms that we measure t=
he literary and historical significance of an individual author. Whatever h=
is borrowings from the American, British, and Continental literary traditio=
n, Ceravolo stands apart as an American literary icon of nearly unparallele=
d achievement. That the American avant-garde was lamenting his "disappeared=
" status (as to the "public" canon) not twenty years ago, and that he has n=
ow received posthumous publication of his collected works from one of the m=
ost august university presses in the nation, is yet another sign, as if any=
 more were needed, that the antagonistic rhetoric of culturally-entrenched =
avant-garde poet-scholars (which heaps equal piles of self-aggrandizing cal=
umny on The New Criticism; the philological and historicist English Literat=
ure scholarship the New Criticism displaced; the Official Verse Culture eng=
endered and sponsored by The New Criticism; the Creative Writing Movement t=
he New Criticism abhorred and was vanquished by; and any attempts at a New =
Avant-Garde among those never lip-bitingly apprenticed to the Old) was, is,=
 and will continue to be--its slickly professional claims of victimhood not=
withstanding--the most powerful canonizing force in American letters.=20

Ceravolo transcends the canon--both the institutionally-approved and the in=
creasingly robust alternative versions--because in his life he occupied the=
 sort of real social spaces poets inhabit and alter irrevocably, and in his=
 verse he occupied the sort of real psychic spaces each one of us inhabits =
but often finds unaccountably difficult (lacking Ceravolo's genius) to reif=
y on the page. Ceravolo's verse is at once classical and fresh, tender and =
profound, succinct and expansive, tantalizingly parseable yet divinely inef=
fable. It would take a lifetime of expert reading to fully appreciate this =
lifetime of superlative writing; with the long-awaited publication of a col=
lected Ceravolo, America's contemporary poetry readers now have the opportu=
nity to do their part.=20

Dear Stephen,

Could you please share with the list the process by which you arrived at
the name Smell My Metal Knees for your promised journal?  It sounds like
a specialty magazine to me.  Were you angry when you invented the name?
Frustrated?  It doesn't sound warm or fuzzy, or "efficient" as
one-syllable names like "Fence" "Chain" "Grid" or other well-known
and highly respected venues sound.  Or were you inspired by science
fiction, or is the title based in a hidden autobiographical detail, as,
for instance, I could theoretically invent a magazine named "Rub My
Metal Shoulder," and be entirely accurate, since my shoulder does
indeed set off security alarms at airports. (This is a matter of
record.) In short--Have you undergone knee replacement and taken this
way to hint darkly at the fact?  Or is there some other effect you wish
to produce by this interesting title?

Every best wish,

Jess

Much sadness.  This was written for Anselm when he was hospitalized in
the summer of 2003


EVERYTHING TRANSLATES

for Anselm

To hear the fan go

to imagine air

filling whatever space

is before it, hot interior

of a cabin, half-helix

of the ear where sound tickles.

Cage shuts himself

in a still, sealed room

to hear his blood pound.

No purity like that
for the translator letting

the world's noise enter,

an intruder banging on the door.

At least, half of the pounding

gets past the tympanum,

at least half of that reaches

to the heart which adds

that pounding to its own.

 appearances by Cocteau, Heidegger, Madame Bovary, and a few essential othe=
rs. True to the Orphic agenda, sound, made overtly and gorgeously lyric, be=
comes the dominant character, increasingly swept up into a dynamically chor=
eographed typography. It=E2=80=99s a book of big ideas and big feeling, yet=

fyi:  for anybody interested in Robinson Jeffers, my own bit in the latest
Otoliths is "Poems Floated from the Hearth" a kind of an extended
commentary on Jeffers, poets of the SF Renaissance, and Rexroth as seen
through a poem of Kevin Opstedal's and focusing upon a recent critical
book: Jeffers and the American Sublime by Zaller (stanford U press.  My

What is poetry today? What has changed? How do we teach poetry and get stud=
ents to transform their passion for performance into meaningful analysis? T=

r near the end of your graduate studies in this field, and have an interest=
, please read the attached =93Dear Colleague=94 letter with much more detai=

gmented with cameo appearances by Cocteau, Heidegger, Madame Bovary, and a =
few essential others. True to the Orphic agenda, sound, made overtly and go=

Dear Poetics List:

I'm happy to announce NYU's Summer Intensive in Creative Writing -- June
16-June 28th. This year's guest writers are Roxana Robinson (fiction),
Chase Twiichlell (Poetry) and Michael Thomas (nonfiction). During this two
week workshop participants work with the guest writers and in the mornings
work improvisationally in workshops I conduct along with my colleague April
Krassner.  We work with a variety of constraints -- Oulipean and others. We
invent them.

The program grants 4 undergraduate credits and is also open to postgraduate
students.  I'd appreciate it if you spread the word to students and others.
This is a genuinely experimental program that focuses on writing, not on
career.

The McGhee Division is NYU's college for nontraditional students.

Please direct interested parties to me:

Ruth Danon
Clinical Professor of Creative and Expository Writing
McGhee Division, New York University
rd2@nyu.edu

I'd be most grateful.

So, I take it, we were in the ball park.  Couldn't forward the pix, but
maybe you could, Stephen.  My name is Jesse

Jessie,

the words that form the 'title' of the journal I proposed were the
first things that came to mind on viewing the attached photograph. Altho
I, too, have loads of metal in my hip and ankle, this was so secondary
to that instant that I didn't even think of 'that' until maybe an
hour later. In a way, it is a re-working of the more ordinal 'kiss my
ass,' which the look on the robot's face seems to be suggesting, and
the robot's 'encouraging' hand on the back of the workman's head
seems also suggestively erotic, as if, instead of 'kiss my ass' the
alternate could easily be 'suck my cock,' and, given that it is the
almost 'robotic,' non-empathetic stasis of things novel that are
suggesting this, I thought also, as to the novelty of the poem, that
things 'natural' might usefully be suggested, sexually, in particular,
by way of contrasting the poem's 'novel' (metallic) demands with
'natural' urges (kissing, say, knees, or actually 'getting down on
one's knees') that are always resistent to yet ever-concupiscent in
the dialectic. And of course, there are also 'alchemical' overtones. I
was actually attempting to point toward work that was 'dialogical'
rather than a gathering of pseudo-factual historicity. I hope this
answers sufficeintly your query, and

my best to you.

Looking for Oneself: Contributions to the Study of Charles Olson is a =
website anthology of Ralph Maud's scholarly journal Minutes of the =
Charles Olson Society. The website is back online at a new address, =
charlesolson.org. Charles Olson (1910-1970) was a prolific poet and =
scholar with a revolutionary agenda whose outline can be discerned in =
his seminal manifesto "Projective Verse" (1950). Projective poetics =
found its fullest expression in Olson's The Maximus Poems. Ralph Maud, =
emeritus professor of English at Simon Fraser University, is a dedicated =
Olson scholar with eight books of and about Olson and 66 issues of the =
journal under his belt. Charlesolson.org is a stimulating selection of =
memoirs, essays, transcriptions, reviews and guides to scholarship, with =
supporting material and an interactive news section designed for the =
website. Olson is not for everyone. To a few he is a primary thinker for =
our time. "I would be an historian as Herodotus was, looking/for oneself =
for the evidence of/what is said." ("Letter 23," The Maximus Poems by =
Charles Olson, copyright 1983, the Regents of the University of =
California.)

Subject:      The Metaphor of the Gun in American Poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm very interested in the metaphor of the gun as reflected in American
poetry.  I'm quite aware of My Life had Stood--A Loaded Gun by Emily
Dickinson, and the Currier and Ives shooting contest in Song of Myself,
but more titles, and more contemporary manifestations in poetry, and
especially linguistically innovative poetry would be of interest.

Hi,

If anyone is aware of any texts that address interconnections (poetic or otherwise) between Robinson Jeffers and the Beat movement, I'd love to hear about them.

Thanks much,
Sarah

Subject:      The Making of Americans and The Making of Earthlings--Gurdjieff's
              Parody of Stein
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As one who has read two nearly impossible books to read in their
entirety: Stein's Making of Americans and Gurdjieff's Beezelbub's
Tales To His Grandson, and who is now engaged in a little Stein project
on Facebook at the moment, not so much to produce product, but to
experience process, I would like to point out distinct similarities that
exist in the repetitive stylings and written orality exhibited in
structure and content (as per Ong and others), in the "intentional
difficulties and layerings of complexities" including the repetitive,
hypnotic use of gerunds (in the original language and in the
translations of Gurdjieff's work) in the so-called esoteric text of a
Master of the occult and the widely applauded and highly regarded
masterpiece of Gertrude Stein.  Similar catch phrases--"more and
more," "slowly developing," etc., can be found in both texts, and may
very well be a product of a battle of egos between Gurdjieff, a
self-styled (charlatan) genius, and Stein, a self-styled (genuine)
genius--both of whom were connected via "The Rope"--a group of wealthy
writers who were Stein's friends, and also followers of Gurdjieff--a
gentleman not particularly liked by Stein.  The Making of Americans was
surely known to Gurdjieff via The Rope, well before it was published in
the Contact edition of 1926, and was probably the inspiration behind the
writing of Beezlebub's Tales--said to have taken place during
Gurdjieff's recovery from a car accident in 1925 and given oral
readings in the years following by his students.  No doubt oral readings
of The Making of Americans were also taking place among Stein's own
friends and followers, so we can almost see the shadows of a competition
that may have escaped the biographers of Stein and Gurdjieff up to the
present moment, with Stein merely telling of the making of Americans,
while Gurdjieff laid bare the arcane mechanisms of earthlings told from
the repetitive, and sometimes nostalgic (!) point of view of Aliens
speeding on a space ship.  When can almost hear Gurdjieff's "Ha, take
that Gertrude Stein," or the esoteric equivalent of it, whatever that
may be, when we lay both books on the desk before us and position them
side by side.  Jess

Hold On To Your Hat
Interviews with Bern Porter edited by mIEKAL aND

http://xexoxial.org/is/hold_on_to_your_hat/by/bern_porter

2013. 8x10, 221 pages
ISBN-10: 1-936687-07-0 | ISBN-13: 978-11936687-07-7

This is the long-awaited collection of interviews & photos spanning 25
years in the life of Bern Porter wherein he reveals the secrets of
forming the Institute for Advanced Thinking, growing up in Maine,
observing the nature of plasma and the universe and how to design the
perfect shoe and bake the perfect onion, as well as sharing anecdotes
about famous personages from history that he may or may not have ever
met and explaining why found poetry is the literature of the future.

"I am the inventor of Found Art. This was a tremendous development for
me. I was born without anything and therefore had no money for an
artist's tools such as easels, paints, brushes, etc. So, at the age of
four, I invented Found Art. I would go to the Post Office wastebasket
and go through it, pulling out things that in some way would interest
me. I'd find printed words, word gems, and combinations of words that
were poems in themselves. With a found poem, I would go through the
wastebasket, take scissors and glue and put it together. Cut and
reassemble it. I am the inventor of the whole philosophy of Found
Art."

Thanks to Cort Bledsoe for his beautifully-written review of Looms for
Bookslut:

http://www.bookslut.com/poetry/2013_02_019866.php

Cheers!
Camille

Excerpts from reviews:

Looms is a wonderful continuation of Martin=92s previous collection, Sonnet=
s,
in which she explored similar themes as well as playing with the sonnet
form. Martin has proven herself to be a solid poet with an ear for language
and an inquisitive mind, delving into the big questions we all face. In
this collection, Martin has woven a rich tapestry of poems that are well
worth perusing.
=97Cort Bledsoe for Bookslut

There is such an expansiveness to Martin=92s Looms. The poems exist in that
magical place where words, images and ideas collide, creating connections
that previously had never been.
=97rob mclennan

[Looms] has a very painterly, noir feel, alienated and penumbral, taut yet
expansive. Impressive and addictive.

'Smell My Metal Knees' as title was inspired by a photograph of a workman w=
ho seems to be working on one of the legs of a robot=2C which has its hand =
on the back of the workman's head=2C seeming to draw him closer=2C so as to=
 seem both sexually suggestive=2C as well as having something to do with th=
e power of 'novelty' to draw from nature its sinews and somehow 'idealize' =
them=2C thus=2C the robotic asking 'smell my metal knees' seemed an encoura=
gement toward Apollonic 'form' as well as an expression of desire=2C and an=
 insult=2C of sorts=2C as well=2C having=2C as it does=2C have overtones of=
 'kiss my ass.'
=20
One pertinent question related to 'smell my metal knees' would have to do w=
ith ways in which to slow the continuous extractive powers that have been s=
o heavily capitalized at this point=2C as to nearly seem 'the whole picture=
.'
=20
The intent of the magazine=2C as it were=2C would thus having something to =
do with the continuously comedic=2C taken=2C of course=2C in an outre yet d=
eadly serious way.  Since there has been so little response thus far=2C my =
sense - suspected always but now somewhat more confirmed - is that there is=
 little out there that is either continuously comedic=2C outre or deadly se=
rious.  Of course=2C I am entirely willing to be shown the errors of my way=
s=2C and the distortion of my beliefs.  I had thought that so being 'done t=
o' would make an interesting read.  I would like only to mix with=2C and mi=
x it up with=2C the Dead=2C who=2C in my understanding=2C basically can be =
reached only by email=2C or such associated lists as this one=2C thus=2C my=
 initial address.

Martin Edmond's *Eternities* is at once memoir, belle lettrist in a kind of
Modernist French tradition, lyric prose poetry, literary criticism. He is a
chronicler of lost and discarded sacred things, people, places=97Tempe
Velodrome, the Manzil Room, the Wet Taxis playing at the Britannia Hotel.
The writing frequently builds a pathos that often leads to grieving,
grieving for lost youth and ruined possibilities. The paradox is that the
romantic desire for the ideal can be realized in dreaming. Edmond is so
authentic you can believe every anecdote he tells, partly because he puts
himself and the reader at the scene of real crimes and with novelist=92s
skills re-enacts their immediate horror. Meticulous research underpins the
mythic dreaming and the constant resurgence (via mechanisms of memory,
portents-reading, and hallucination) of the uncanny, seeping, if you like,
out to the detritus of past time. The intertextual transcends the dull
mechanics of postmodern technique, emerging epically as the Koran, the
Tora, Aztec lore and old Testament parable populated with
hithertouncelebrated gypsies, thieves, dream-chasing hippies, and
murderers. The
book rolls with humanity, a secularized laughter and magic. Not theological
at all, but as powerful as re-incarnation and pagan idol worship; such
profound depth to even the most innocuous recollections. Perhaps it is
Edmond=92s expat origins, a New Zealander who has made Sydney crueler,
kinder, more exotic and more magical than it ever could be on its own: *. .
. in those moments some ineffable translation happens, some occult
adjustment of soul, some realignment of possibilities, after which he is
profoundly changed. And all else too. It is as the book says=97the redeemed
world will be the same but not as this is. It=92s theology without god. It=
=92s
nothing. Everything.* =97*Adam Aitken*



Martin Edmond=92s bohemian travels documented within these prose pieces are
eternities made manifest in run-down flats, movie sets and, along with
other jobs, toiling on the night shift at the post office among fellow
poets, painters, musicians and other variously assembled creatures of the
night. Here is a writer with abundant gifts. With a novelist=92s eye for
detail and a poet=92s perfect pitch Martin Edmond lives the life of the
writer who takes ecstatic possession of every living moment. Within these
pages the writer asks, =91can music banish a curse?=92 You bet it can. =97*=
Richard
Lopez*

Maneri who passed away in August, 2009. Open to all, bring your
instrument or your voice, a story, a poem or just your ears and some
appreciation for Joe.

Joe Maneri was little known to many mainstream music lovers but to those

enough to have heard some of his recorded music, he has been named a

missed.

spiritual journey and is a moving statement of love, patience and
friendship in its purest form.

Sounds great until you get to this part:

& then you realize that what it is is crass exploitation, sweat-shop labor

It's interesting that while Henry Miller did connect with the Beats--or
they with him, I can't recall reading of any of the Beats or even the
tangentially Beat writers going to visit him.  Maybe William Everson
did, since he was such a fan of Jeffers-like narratives, and a producer
of the same.  Once again, Rexroth--if you want to count him as a Beat
probably did encounter him, as he encountered Ina Coolbrith Clark Ashton
Smith and the other first gen San. Fran. writers this side of Jack
London and George Sterling, but by god I don't recall any written
Rexroth memories of an actual Jeffers visit.  Jeffers was still alive
and kicking--though he wasn't writing much by the time the Beats really
got going, and I wonder how much he would have had in common with what
they were up to anyway.  He strikes me as someone who didn't get into
fast cars, drinking all night, and all of that stuff.  Jeffers didn't
have much to do with Williams either come to think about it, and
Williams was key to the Beats.  Interesting question.  Now what the
critics have said about influences, maybe Snyder and Welch with their
version of ecopoetics, etc.  Maybe.  Jess

As you may know we are running a scholarship campaign through Indiegogo =
to help students in financial need attend classes. To date we have =
raised enough to fund either four students for a Master Class (with =
either Eileen Myles or Charles Bernstein) or two students for a full =
8-week course (from our regular course offerings). Our goal is to be =
able to fund ten students for a Master Class or five students for an =
8-week course. The campaign ends February 22nd. We=92re almost there.=20

Can you help? Just $10 will make a difference.

Are recent demographic stats available?  When I edited John Gardner's
fiction/poetry journal MSS. in the mid-to-late 80s, four or five years  after he
had crashed his motorcycle in Pennsylvania and died, subscriptions fell
from 2,000 to 167, a fact I knew, since I automated the subscriber list and
sent  reminders and shipped issues and coordinated printing and screened
submissions.  Gardner's widow (not precisely a widow, since he had been
divorced for a week) kept the number of subscribers at 2,000 in her  listings.

Victor E. Reichert (1897-1990) was rabbi of the Rockdale Avenue Temple in C=
incinnati, Ohio, from 1938 to 1962 and shared a long friendship with the Am=
erican poet Robert Frost (1874-1963). In 1946 Reichert invited Frost to pre=
sent a sermon, and in 1960 he was instrumental in awarding Frost an honorar=
y Doctorate at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Victor Re=
ichert was an avid Frost collector, and his collection passed to his son Dr=
. Jonathan Reichert, Professor Emeritus from the UB Department of Physics, =
who donated it to the Poetry Collection. The Reichert Frost Collection feat=
ures many signed and inscribed publications by Frost, a Frost manuscript, l=
etters, photographs, audio recordings, and ephemera, as well as many Frost-=
related items from other critics.



The donation of this collection was recently featured on NPR's Morning Edit=
ion on the 50th anniversary of Frost's death:

Subject: The Metaphor of the Gun in American Poetry

I'm very interested in the metaphor of the gun as reflected in American
poetry.  I'm quite aware of My Life had Stood--A Loaded Gun by Emily
Dickinson, and the Currier and Ives shooting contest in Song of Myself,
but more titles, and more contemporary manifestations in poetry, and
especially linguistically innovative poetry would be of interest.

I now have a new (first) website!
Stephen Vincent: Artist, Poet and Maker of Books
It includes a good visual survey of my Haptic artwork, including  accordion fold
books and drawings. Of  specific interest here may be  a selection of 10 works I
made while listening to poets  reading from their work, primarily in the Bay
Area (tho it is a national cast - Frank Sherlock, CA Conrad, Fanny Howe, Beverly
Dahlen among others). I have made over 50 of these over the last several years.
Yes, I admit it, readings have been an addiction!
Also is a bibliography of my poetry books, including hot links to ebooks at
 faux and Shearsman. And a link to my dormant blog archive, which I am
threatening to wake up with new entries. (Back to the blogs, rumor is that
Facebook is about to bomb from user fatigue).
If you are - for many are far flung chance - in the Bay Area this weekend, I
will have a table (#48) at Codex, the international book fair for artist and
hand crafted books. It will be in Richmond on the Marina. They have a web
site: http://www.codexfoundation. org/2013/2013.html

Which - the international part -  does remind me that I will be a presenter this
June in Glasgow at the Ekphrasis Conference I will appreciate your interest and
feedback. To build a good website, I discovered, is no small thing.

hi Sarah,

don't know if you saw my post but in the latest Otoliths I have a longish
review piece (
http://the-otolith.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/patrick-james-dunagan.html) that
covers Jeffers relationship to "the beats" in so far that it mentions
Whalen, Welch, Snyder, Kyger, and Spicer--- also Rexroth---- who is the
sorta lynchpin/hangup (w/ a bit of grouchiness   that brings them to
Jeffers----- also William Everson is a central Jeffers disciple  ifya
haven't read his seminal study Archetype West I'd heavily encourage you to
do that along with his interviews and 2 critical volumes on Jeffers .... I
do cite a number of critical pieces in the bit, tho it doesn't have a works
cited, I tried to include the titles of the essays when doing so and of
course I name the author, so googling will pull up the complete citation---
I'm happy to help tho if needed (backchannel

cheers,

Patrick

Murat, Well, It seems this could be the perfect journal for the
Drive-Thru School of American Poetry, like Origin was for Black
Mountain.  In fact, Steve's description nails it.

Or better ye, Murat,--the Drive-By School of American Poetics.  This
could be literary history in the making.  Remember, you saw it here
first.

Jeffers' wife raced cars in Southern California, but this is before 1913.
 They were pretty well known in Carrmel for in-home musical evenings
earlier in their time there.

There also seems to have been a Krishnamurti/Theosophy connection.

Thanks for the article, Patrick.

Hi All,

Bill (Everson)'s connection to Jeffers is described at length in my dad's
biography "The Life of Brother Antoninus (written by Lee Barltett).
Although I have never hear Bill called a Beat Poet. He was very loosely
associated with San Fran. Renaissance (although him and Duncan didn't get
along too well, always). Jennifer

My dad edited tons of Bill's stuff. The other one I have here is Naked
Heart (that's essays by UNM Press) and the Veritable Years (which largely
poetry). There is tons of other stuff but don't have in my mind...

I went to Bill's house as a teenager (it was called Kingfisher Flat) it was
wonderful in the Santa Cruz mountains. Bill had pretty severe Parkinsons by
then, but I was lucky to meet him (as an "adult).

Utopic Monster Theory is a polydesirous bricolage of text-movement explorin=
g 21st century cultural work. The performance defines and attempts to under=
stand why artists=E2=80=99 creative labor is undervalued. Source material a=
nd inspiration are derived from: Antony & the Johnsons, Joseph Beuys, the B=
lack Panther Party, Bleach anime series, Family Guy TV show, the Internal R=
evenue Service, Andrew Joron, John Lennon, Bernadette Mayer, Herman Melvill=
e, Thomas More, Eric Satie, Mary Shelly, and Hannah Weiner.

Honey Pot Performance will present an excerpt of their newest project, The =
Price Point of Living, which illuminates stories of everyday citizens strug=
gling to find a sense of direction, purpose, and value in the wake of an un=
certain labor market. At its core, the work explores the abstract question =
=E2=80=9CWhat is the value of living?=E2=80=9D =20

J'SUN HOWARD is a dance artist/writer whose choreography has appeared in mu=
ltiple venues including Links Hall, Northwestern University, Sonotheque, Li=
ncoln Square Theatre, Insight Arts/Center for New Possibilities, Epiphany C=
hurch, and was commissioned for Chicago Academy School for the Arts student=
s. He was selected to be a LinkUp Residency Artist at Links Hall and in 201=
0 was granted the Julius Margolin Scholarship =E2=80=9CYouth In Labor Award=
=E2=80=9D to protest at the School of Americas. J=E2=80=99Sun has performed=
 for many Chicago choreographers, most extensively with Darrell Jones. His =
literary work can be seen in journals Chicago IRL, The Garland Court Review=
, and Storyglossia.

JENNIFER KARMIN's multidisciplinary projects have been presented at festiva=
ls, artist-run spaces, and on city streets across the U.S., Japan, Kenya, a=
nd Europe. These collaborative pieces include 4000 Words 4000 Dead, Revolut=
ionary Optimism, Walking Poem, and Unnatural Acts. She is the author of the=
 text-sound epic Aaaaaaaaaaalice and her poetry was recently published in t=
he anthology I=E2=80=99ll Drown My Book: Conceptual Writing by Women. Jenni=
fer teaches in the Creative Writing program at Columbia College and at Trum=
an College, where she works with immigrants as a community educator. Since =
2005, she has curated the Red Rover Series.

HONEY POT PERFORMANCE is a woman-focused creative collaborative community
comprising five core members: Meida McNeal, Felicia Holman, Abra Johnson,
Boogie McClarin, and Aisha Jean-Baptiste. They draw upon a central notion f=
ound in performance studies, black feminist discourse and sociology: non
Western, everyday popular and/or folk forms of cultural performance are
valuable sites of knowledge production and cultural capital for
subjectivities that often exist outside of mainstream communities.=20

IRA S. MURFIN is a writer, theatre artist, and doctoral candidate in
Northwestern University=E2=80=99s Interdisciplinary PhD in Theatre & Drama.=

I had a dream that J. Robert Oppenheimer appeared on What's My Line, and
when everyone had their masks on, and the great genius had signed in and
was grimly but gamely seated, the lights went out, and only the host,
the producers, the renowned but remorseful intellect who would never win
a Nobel prize for anything, and the live T.V. audience, the mothers,
fathers, boys and girls watching at home, and all the ships watching at
sea, as well as the makers of Serutan (which is Nature's backwards),
knew the difference.

Speaking of smelling metal knees, I read a nice piece today by one =
Rebecca Solnit in the *London Review of Books* which painted a rather =
unflattering portrait of my old town; I thought I might ask Bay Area =
poets to respond.

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n03/rebecca-solnit/diary

Here's a relevant paragraph in case the link asks you to subscribe or =
something:

"A Latino who has been an important cultural figure for forty years is =
being evicted while his wife undergoes chemotherapy. One of San =
Francisco's most distinguished poets, a recent candidate for the city's =
poet laureate, is being evicted after 35 years in his apartment and his =
whole adult life here: whether he will claw his way onto a much humbler =
perch or be exiled to another town remains to be seen, as does the fate =
of a city that poets can't afford. His building, full of renters for =
most or all of the past century, including a notable documentary =
filmmaker, will be turned into flats for sale. A few miles away, friends =
of friends were evicted after twenty years in their home by two Google =
attorneys, a gay couple who moved into two separate units in order to =
maximi[z]e their owner-move-in rights. Rental prices rose between 10 and =
135 per cent over the past year in San Francisco's various =
neighbo[o]rhoods, though thanks to rent control a lot of San Franciscans =
were paying far below market rates even before the boom -- which makes =
adjusting to the new market rate even harder. Two much-loved used =
bookstores are also being evicted by landlords looking for more money; =
16 restaurants opened last year in their vicinity. On the waterfront, =
Larry Ellison, the owner of Oracle and the world's sixth richest man, =
has been allowed to take control of three city piers for 75 years in =
return for fixing them up in time for the 2013 America's Cup; he will =
evict dozens of small waterfront businesses as part of the deal."

I mean, on the day when pitchers and catchers report, I'm reconsidering =
being a Giants fan. Cleveland Indians anyone?

Steve Benson is thinking about how to read. He recently finished a set of
memoirs called *The Grand Piano*, co-authored with ten friends. At his last
New York reading, in March 2012, he did a lot of shouting and talking and
walked around in semi-darkness while ice melted on the loft=92s ceiling.


Teresa Carmody is the author of the story collection *Requiem* (Les Figues
Press, 2005) and the chapbooks *I Can Feel* (Insert Press, 2011) and *Your
Spiritual Suit of Armor by Katherine Anne* (Woodland Editions, 2009). She
is cofounder and co-director (with Vanessa Place) of Les Figues Press and
teaches at California Institute of the Arts.

Subject:      poetry writing workshop in jackson heights, queens
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi All,

could you please forward this to interested parties?   Thanks, Lisa Jarnot


In the autumn I ran a workshop with the theme "poet's notebooks" and
it went really well. I'm running part 2 of the class on mondays
6-8:30 from Feb 25 to April 29 at my apartment in Jackson Heights,
Queens. I have 4 students enrolled and am looking for 3 more.

Cost is $300 for new students, $275 for returning
students. I want to run the class as a theater performance of sorts.
There will be five topics that we'll focus on in notebook writing:


Architecture
Food
State dept (current international affairs)
Language
Meteorology


And we will spend two weeks on each topic. The goal is to write
obsessively in the notebook about the topic in an "as if" mode.
(during these two weeks I AM an architect or I AM fluent in Japanese,
or I AM a state dept official.)  I'm thinking of the workshop meetings
as a kind of salon, where we come in, have a glass of wine, (or tea),
and talk about our discoveries, read from our notebooks, and spin off
into in-class writing exercises inspired by the information we've
gathered.

I can't imagine any connection between Jeffers and the Beats
except in readers' minds.

You've gotten a lot of good ideas recently, but I've several more =
suggestions for you.

Tim Hunt edited the five-volume Collected Poetry (Jeffers) and is =
certainly one of the pre-eminant Jeffers scholars living.  He also =
recently published--or is about to publish--a book on Kerouac and if =
anyone knows the ready connections between Jeffers and the beats, it is =
likely him.  You can connect with Tim via his web-site:  =
http://www.tahunt.com/ =20
I know Tim very well and I am sure he would be delighted to talk with =
you.

Bob Brophy is another pre-eminent Jeffers scholar and I know he knows a =
great deal about Jeffers and the beats.  I am hesitant to put people's =
e-mail addresses out on list-servs, but if you wish to back-channel me, =
I can connect you with Bob.  He is another good friend and I'm sure he =
would be glad to share what he knows.

The Robinson Jeffers Association web-site has all the back issues of the =
RJ Newsletter on-line, as well as many volumes of Jeffers Studies:  =
http://www.robinsonjeffersassociation.org/

The RJA also maintains a list-serv and I am certain if you posed your =
query to that list-serv you would get a ton of feedback, ideas, and =
directions:   <rjeffers@mm.isu.edu>

As I'm sure you know, the beats were far more interested in Jeffers than =
he was of them.  Of course they hardly overlapped, RJ dying in 1962.  =
But the Beat Museum in San Francisco, for example, displays a bust of =
Jeffers, good indication that he was meaningful to them.  I am certain =
there is some scholarship on RJ and the beats out there; the connection =
is not tenuous.

I am a long-time Jeffers scholar and member of RJA; feel free to drop my =
name when/if you contact any of the people I've mentioned here.

One quick note on the post below: Jeffers was absolutely into "fast cars =
and drinking all night" as the first two volumes of the Collected =
Letters amply demonstrates.  Life and times at Tor House were absolutely =

punning and knowing, theatre and theory" (Charles Bernstein), "a tour =20=

de force of linguistic doublespeak" (Globe and Mail), and "opens up =20
the possibilities of reading" (Vancouver Courier). She is co-founding =20=

Twentieth
Gil McElroy
$4

	Apollinaire

	Youre
	in Europe. Youre
	tired, & youre
	reading poetry all day. Youre
	very pompous
	& still confessing a
	hole here, a world
	there, a heart, a
	wretched heart.

	Goodbye
	life. Wherever you go Im sick of hearing
	me.
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	Apollinare is the best example: undemanding Apollinaire,
	inevitable Apollinaire, Apollinare with all the answers. You saw
	yourself in Apollinaire, Apollinaire in your eyes. Look behind me,
	Apollinaire, while I mourn.

it is pretty bad.  and what Solnit reports is accurate so far as I have
some knowledge of who she speaks. (She gave a rather grandstanding bit in
regards to all this @ the 3 hour multi-speaker Jay Defeo event the other
Sat @ SFMoma.)  There's also Kevin Killian's bit:
http://www.sfbg.com/2012/10/16/sf-stories-kevin-killian  Kind of beating
her to the punch at least for local readers.
However, as I ribbed Kevin a little, his claim: "we counted and realized
that only three poets under the age of forty remain in San Francisco." is
rather silly. I personally know at least 6 closely--- no matter how you
wanna break down what makes a "poet" a poet. & i checked with Kevin and he
was only counting one of mine, I think. and he didn't really know where the
others lived.  But everybody else lives in the East Bay it's true, , have
lost at least 3 or more "young poets" in the last couple years and nearly
just lost another, but luckily he's now just living closer to me,  and
that's where all the hip house readings are for the most part. I stay in
the city myself.  As for the Giants--- the new park is really very nice.
I'd much prefer they start to lose tho and tickets become cheaper and more
available and eventually the whole stadium just becomes a public park of
some kind. Open all the time.

Greetings!

We are writing to invite you to learn more about an exciting three

ry=94
*

**

*Application Deadline: March 4, 2013*



What *is* poetry today? What has changed? How do we teach poetry and get
students to transform their passion for performance into meaningful
analysis? The Institute seeks to strengthen the connections between
foundational and contemporary forms of poetry, between the practice of
poetry and today=92s global society, and between the words and sounds and t=
he
spirit of black poetry that refuses to be denied.



If you are a current college or university teacher of American literature
or near the end of your graduate studies in this field, and have an
interest, please read the attached =93Dear Colleague=94 letter with much mo=

Thanks for checking out the article, Catherine.

Una Jeffers, his wife, did lead a very interesting life--- I also wrote up
the latest vol of letters awhile ago:
http://criticalflame.org/nonfiction/0912_dunagan.htm
it's somewhat worthwhile & a lovely looking book--- if VERY long---
the Krishnamurti/Theosophy connection pops up there in so far that Una
reports on some of the visits they had ---
she wrote most of the Jeffers correspondence.
There's also an awesome pic in the book of Una with Langston Hughes outside
by some rocks accompanied by a couple bottles of something or other

Risk-Shapers: Sharon Dolin and Peter Covino: Reading & Conversation
Book Culture, Thursday, Feb. 28th, 7pm, Free and Open to the Public

Join us for two award-winning poets who will read from their new books =
and discuss the wellsprings of their work. What drives them to write? =
Both risk-takers in form and subject matter, how do they think about the =
ethical issues associated with writing about sexuality, abuse, mental =
illness? Both poets will also talk about the various poetries, both at =
home and abroad, that inform their work. Boundary-crossers in =
aesthetics, language, and culture, these Sharon and Peter will also =
answer questions from the audience.

If you're a teacher of poetry, this is a great event to bring your =
students to.

Hi,

Beecher's magazine is now accepting entries for the annual contest, which c=
loses on March 31. The poetry judge is Lyn Hejinian. Perhaps you or someone=
 you know would like to enter.

Only $12 for the entry fee (which looks like a bargain, these days) for $20=
0 + publication in #3 (and copies). Beecher's is still pretty young, so the=
 odds of making the first cut are still pretty reasonable, methinks.

Just wanted to mention the Stein Making of Repeating Loving Being

happy detournes of the day for one and all.  We're now featuring film
clips of luminaries etc.,singers, etc., animals etc.,discussing, etc.,
debating, etc.,dancing, reading, guessing detourning--which is the
beauty point of the whole thing.

For instance

the closest direct contact that I've been able to find regarding Jeffers
and the Beats was Kenneth Rexroth's1957 review of Radcliffe Squire=92s *The
Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers*, titled =93In Defense of Jeffers,=94  where =
he
says lots of asinine things, and then  in *The Selected Letters of Robinson
Jeffers*, when writing to Radcliffe Squires who had forwarded him Rexroth=
=92s
review, Jeffers showed little interest in Rexroth=92s =93silly article=94 w=
hich
=93is not disturbing but merely obvious=94 [the quotes are from Jeffers'
letter].

Dear poetics readers=2C
In 2007=2C Joshua Marie Wilkinson and I started Letter Machine Editions as =
a nonprofit publisher of new books and chapbooks. We've released works by S=
awako Nakayasu=2C Farid Matuk=2C Anselm Berrigan=2C Andrea Rexilius=2C Pete=
r Gizzi=2C John Yau=2C Travis Nichols=2C Juliana Leslie=2C and Sara Veglahn=
.  Fred Moten's new book is coming out later in the year.
Right now=2C we are wrapping up the proofs of our two most ambitious titles=
 to date:
Eddie Berrigan's Can It!=2C an aesthetic memoir of sorts that features inte=
rviews=2C absurdist prose=2C travelogues=2Cetc. It's a book that's balanced=
 between several tragedies in order to figure out how to proceed as both an=
 artist and=2C really=2C as a person.=20
and
Aaron Kunin's Grace Period: notebooks 1998-2007. This book is going to slay=
 you. I was lucky enough to publish a small excerpt as a chapbook years ago=
=2C and that was awarded the inaugural Essay Prize. You can read an excerpt=
 here: http://www.essayprize.org/winners_kunin_essay1.php
We've decided to do something a little different here in terms of funding=
=3B actually=2C to return to a century-old model of subscription for these =
titles. We are well aware that you get a lot of requests to donate funds to=
 small presses like ours=3B we get them too. Really=2C it's a subscription =
to these books we're offering at a deep discount. Our hope is that we can r=
aise enough money to cover the printing costs and get them to readers who'd=
 be moved by them.=20
$35 gets you both of our new titles=2C shipping included.
Right now=2C we're just $2=2C000 away from our goal=2C but there's only abo=
ut ten days left in our campaign=2C after which the Kunin book will retail =
for $25 and the Berrigan for $20.=20
Support us if you can by subscribing here.
Infinite thanks--Josh & Noah

Not to beat a dead horse, but...there are now two volumes of the =
COMPLETE LETTERS of Robinson and Una Jeffers out from Stanford--a HUGE =
improvement over the old Selected.  Volume three should be out within a =
year.  James Karman has done a masterful job with the letters, and we =
now have a much clearer idea of what daily life was like for the Jeffers =
family.

Again, Jeffers was not a person who sought out the literary lime-light, =
but I do believe that the Beats were quite fond of him.  As for the zero =
mentions of other poets in the Selected, that is likely an omission by =
Ridgeway as to her own notions of "selection."  Jeffers is often =
mistaken as an Emily Dickinson type, but in fact he had a wide circle of =
friends and a constant stream of visitors to Tor House.  The Tor House =
website says: "Many influential literary and cultural celebrities were =
guests of the Jeffers family.  Among them were Sinclair Lewis, Edna St. =
Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, Charles Lindbergh, George Gershwin and =
Charlie Chaplin.  Later visitors have included William Everson, Robert =
Bly, Czeslow Milosz and Edward Abbey."
Additionally, James Karman's biography of RJ provides an exhaustive list =
of visitors that is virtually a who's-who of mid-twentieth century =
writers, artists, and celebrities!

I am well aware that none of those listed above are Beats; as I said, =
they were more interested in him than he in they, especially given that =
he was quite at the end of his life when they arrived on the scene.  But =
I just wanted to clarify that the Selected Letters is not a very =
good--i.e., informative--source, that the Collected Letters is =
authoritative, and that Jeffers did interact with a great many of the =
writers, artists, actors, and celebrities of his day.

At 11:00 a.m. EST, in room 518 of LaQuinta Inn, Orlando, Florida, USA, I
found the right word at the right time for the right place for a 25 year
old poem that I've been attempting to finish.  Now, I'm happy to
announce, it's finished and it's one of my best.  I'll celebrate with
a long walk in the heat and maybe some chili mac at Steak 'n Shake.

And so it goes,

P.S. the word was "schist."

Subject:      Announcing the VERSeOttawa Hall of Honour: William Hawkins and
              Greg Frankson

VERSeOttawa works constantly towards supporting poetry and the poetry
community in Ottawa, but we are not the first to do this. There have been
many important people who have helped create, shape and support this
artform that we love and the community that has built up around it.

It is with this in mind that VERSeOttawa has decided to create the
VERSeOttawa Hall of Honour. It is our way of recognizing the important
contributions made to the Ottawa poetry community, whether through poetry
itself or other methods of support (or, as is often the case, both). Each
year a nomination committee will choose two worthy inductees whose work
will be honoured that year, and into the future.

An induction ceremony will be conducted as part of VERSeFest. This year
that will take place on March 17th.

The nomination committee this year has chosen two people to be the first
inducted in to the VERSeFest Hall of Honour.

We are proud to recognize William Hawkins and Greg Ritallin Frankson

****************

As a poet, William Hawkins was nationally-known and regarded as Ottawas
best and certainly most dangerous poet from 1964 to 1974. He published a
number of books, including the infamous Ottawa Poems, published by Nelson
Balls weed/flower. Hawkins appeared in the anthology New Wave Canada,
edited by Raymond Souster as the last publication by Contact Press.

As an organizer/host, Hawkins ran Ottawas infamous coffeehouse Le Hibou
through the 1960s with his wife. He hosted performances by Gordon
Lightfoot, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell and dozens, if not hundreds of others.

He was an advocate, writer and large presence during a period of Ottawa
poetry that had very few of any of those; he was also a writer actively
reading, writing and publishing, and connecting to a community far wider
than that of the immediate city.

You can read more about him at his website, here:
http://www.wmhawkins.com/content/poetry.html

************************

Greg Frankson debuted as Ritallin in Ottawa in 2003. In 2004 he
represented Ottawa at the Wordlympics (now known as the Canadian Festival
of Spoken Word), and did so again in 2006. In addition to being a
full-time professional artist, Greg recently was on the team that won the
2012 Canadian Slam Championships (though now representing Toronto).

Immediately following the Wordlympics in 2004, Greg co-founded Capital
Slam, now one of the longest running monthly slam series in the country.
He ran Capital Slam and the Capital Poetry Collective for 2 years where he
created the template for a stable, supportive, inspiring slam series. He
also founded the Bill Brown 1-2-3 series.

Before moving to Toronto, Greg co-founded the Ottawa Youth Poetry Slam.
Creating this environment for young poets to come and share their work was
a crucial step in the evolution of the spoken word poetry scene in Ottawa.
The poets coming out of the slam have received great accolades, but even
more important is the fact that it is a place where all youth can have a
voice and share their art.

So while Gregs work was crucial to help create the current Ottawa spoken
word scene, through the Youth Slam his work is just as crucial to the
future of the scene as well.

_____________________________________


=93Being And Event,=94 by Alain Badiou, was published in 2007 by Continuum
in London.  It is, indeed, a monumental book.  In my opinion, it
restores the dignity and elegance of mathematics to continental
philosophy.

Although =93Being And Event=94 is a challenging read, the rewards of the
book greatly outweigh the difficulties encountered. And as far as
philosophy is concerned, this book presents a fresh approach to
ontology, one which goes considerably beyond the limitations of the
Heideggerian edifice.

Based largely on the achievements of set theory, =93Being And Event=94
argues for an open ontology, one wherein truth can rupture seemingly
static conceptual and social situations ... thus bringing about
changes of universal significance.

But nevertheless, what has drawn me most inescapably to =93Being And
Event=94 is that Badiou has included in the very interstices of the book
chapters on poets, from Parmenides to Mallarm=E9 and beyond, their
poetries, and perceptive anyalyses of poetic works, and ALL combined
in the very processes of mathematics and philosophy.

The poetry chapters are not mere fluff, as with most mathematicians,
scientists, and philosophers, but are integrated within the very
structure and the fundamental arguments of the book.

Badiou, like Herodotus, seems to remember a time when poetry had not
yet divided itself out from mathematics.

Indeed, if there is a philosopher/mathematician for poets today, and a
philosopher poet for the day, surely it would be Alain Badiou.

I agree. There are plenty of nonprofit, arts foundations and presses and un=
iversity groups that desperately need unpaid volunteers.  It's very offensi=
ve. Maybe restaurants will follow suit? Wanted waiters and managers, unpaid=
 gigs, but OH what great experience. Or insurance or banks?  Great unpaid o=
pportunity to garner valuable work experience. A ten year unpaid internship=
.

Dear List,

I think E.D. must have been hot.  At least, the rumors about she and
sister Vinnie ran to that effect--that though they did not marry, they
were  frolicsome in company--perhaps a tad on the wild side for their
time and place.  Though these words may sound somewhat flip, they're
well documented in Sewell.  And of course, the poetry attests, that
though ED was one who could pray well (in the proper Kierkegaardean
sense with the eye of intellect trained on the eye of faith, maugre the
bridge of the nose) she could play well too.  Amen to that.

I remember the poetry readings at the Baltimore Theater Project back in
the early 70's, and in particular one evening when Lucille Clifton
arrived, a bit after everyone else was seated on cushions on the bare
floor.  I remember the sense of grace and dignity she carried about with
her, and a kind of silence that surrounded her poems when she read
them--not the silence of steel as in a bell encompassing a
clapper--shrill and cutting to the ear, but a warm silence--and--if you
will--a welcoming silence.

I would also like to point out that as I scanned the list of
"world-class poets," picked to celebrate the work of Lucille Clifton,
I thought of the American sports teams that award themselves "world
championships" without leaving American soil.  Let's change that
"thirteen world-class poets" to "thirteen American-class poets."
Isn't that enough?

Jess

It does worry me greatly. Students in journalism and communication
degrees at UTS (University of Technology, Sydney) are expected to
undertake unpaid internships as a part of their degrees, if they have
any hope of getting a job.

What worries me even more is that teaching staff actively support the
idea of unpaid labour from under grad students, in the hope that they
may gey a job... sounds like blackmail to me. And shame on the
communication degree at UTS. (I feel sorrow and regret to be a graduate
of this degree...)

Re:
> enquiry into rise of unpaid internships ..

To follow this up a little more:

The degree in Communication at the University of Technology, Sydney, has
been considered one of the few leading art degrees, internationally.

Now that teaching staff at UTS have come out in active support of unpaid
internships, which is another word for slave labour, it should follow
that this degree should be treated with the utmost suspicion and
graduates from this degree, should they apply for a position, be treated
as low on the want to hire rank, unless you were after a position which
supports slave labour. (This affects me since I now lose status and
advantage that such an elite degree should offer. Basically, I lose money.)

I mean, who would seriously consider employing someone from an
institution  that advocates slavery? Why pay the bucks when you can get
it for free.

Subject:      Readings near Bangor Maine in early April?
MIME-Version: 1.0

I have just learned that I will be presenting at Maine's "Quality Counts
2013 medical conference in Augusta April 3rd.  Will probably be staying
near Bangor, however.  Are there any poetry venues for early April?
Bearing in mind it is National Poetry Month?  and Stonecoast is nearby?
I would love to meet a poet or two.  A little late for a reading to be
scheduled, I fear.  But perhaps something for the future?

See Sporkworld.org/Deed for more about me and my background.

Thanks for any advice.  Please backchannel.

Best,
Martha

The Worst, by Rebecca Farivar

When I focus I can feel--
honestly feel--what it's like
to burn alive. No one wants
to hear about it. I imagine
at a certain point you must
pass out. But before that
think this is the worst case.
Everyone keeps telling me
to see a therapist. They just don't
want to talk. There are so many
ways you could burn. Most likely
in a car wreck. That's why I feel
it most when driving, and then
I need to breath, calm down,
think of peaceful things
like noodles.

The Derelict Narrative: An Account of In/Words

David Emery offers a companion piece to rob mclennan's Open Book profile
and Peter Gibbon's personal memoir about In/Words, an Ottawa-based
literary collective  now in its teens.  AngelHousePress admires this
persistent adolescent for its sense of community, the variety of
publishing activities it has taken on & its sense of creative whimsy &
mayhem. In/Words is our bratty older brother & we couldn't be more
pleased to see it celebrated & remembered.

please go to angelhousepress.com & click on essays.

remember we are always looking for essays, manifestos, rants,
interviews, reviews, statements on your creative practice or anything
else that might contribute to the ongoing conversation about the
creative arts. please send work my way for consideration, along with a
bio & author photo.

Dear All;

As "Writing Home" continued to reveal itself,  it needed to be
re-thought, redesigned, and somewhat rewritten, including its introduction:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Home/Intro.htm

The next notice will be at #20, the project's conclusion.

As always, thank you so much for receiving this work.

Your feedback is always welcome.

-Joel

Tag, I'm it!

Having been tagged by my friend, partner, & esteemed fellow-poet Marc Vince=
nz, it's my day to play the poetry-interview-pyramid game, "The Next Big Th=
ing!" Today's book is "How to Be Another," coming out soon from =C8erven=E1=
 Barva Press. And don't miss next week's interviews on MadHat Lit from the =
legendary Terese Svoboda, Norma Cole, Sheila Murphy and Gloria Mindock. (ww=
w.madhatlit.com).

What is the working title of the book?

"How to Be Another."

Where did the idea come from for the book?

I was experimenting with a range of variations on the prose poem, from more=
-or-less abstract, aporetic verbal collages, to meditations, to parables an=
d tales, when I realized they had a certain thematic through-line, namely, =
empathy - its necessity as well as its ultimate unattainability. Hence the =
title, "How to Be Another." What's more, I realized my dissimilar approache=
s could be understood as different ways to elucidate, illustrate, or convey=
 that thematic through-line. So I divided the collection into four sections=
: "i.e.," "e.g.," "Rx," and "vis."

What genre does your book fall under?

Prose poetry.

What actors would you choose to play the part of your characters in a movie=
 rendition?

Most of the parts are for CGI-animated impossibilities. But there are also =
ordinary humans in these tales! Chandler Riggs (who plays Carl in The Walki=
ng Dead) would be great for "The Kiss." Elisabeth Moss (who plays Peggy in =
Mad Men) would be amazing in a number of these pieces. "Half-Life" requires=
 a wolf-like white dog, very much like my Samoyed, Loki - although I rather=
 doubt he has any real interest in acting!

What is the one sentence synopsis of your book?

"Between anything & the real thing, jaws snap."

How long did it take you to write the first draft of the manuscript?

Three or four years, give or take a few.

Who or what inspired you to write this book?

Borges, Cortazar, Rimbaud, Mallarme, Russell Edson, Wittgenstein, to name a=
 few. Discovering the breadth of potential for the short prose form mined b=
y these great writers felt like a homecoming for one impulse of my writing =
self.

What else about your book might pique the reader's interest?

Among its cabinet of oddities are boys who "flap their wings and pray for r=
ain," a rebellious moon, intransigent scallops, a dog who can deep sea dive=
, "clouds which act like railroads, taking anything anywhere," a recriminat=
ory moth, and a man whose life is an art exhibit.

Will your book be self-published or represented by an agency?

It will be published by =C8erven=E1 Barva Press later this year.

My tagged writers for next Wednesday are:

Terese Svoboda, "Dogs Are Not Cats" (MadHat Press, 2013)
Norma Cole, "Distraction"
Sheila Murphy, "American Ghazals"
Gloria Mindock, "Screaming for Paul"

Hi all,

My name is Ben Falandays and I am a fourth year undergrad at the University
of Delaware. I'm currently in the process of writing a thesis concerning
the shifting practices of creation and consumption in poetry that come with
the digital media.

As a part of my research, I'm conducting a survey to get some concrete data
about the way that contemporary poets are using media to create, publish,
and read poetry. You can access the survey here:

https://delaware.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4Mjj1q6xudIWRwx

If you are a poet yourself, or have access to a community of poets with
which you could share this survey, your help would be greatly appreciated.
It only takes a few minutes, but you will be making a contribution to our
understanding of how shifts in media affect the world of poetry!

Best,
Ben

Dear List,

I think E.D. must have been hot.  At least, the rumors about she and
sister Vinnie ran to that effect--that though they did not marry, they
were  frolicsome in company--perhaps a tad on the wild side for their
time and place.  Though these words may sound somewhat flip, they're
well documented in Sewell.  And of course, the poetry attests, that
though ED was one who could pray well (in the proper Kierkegaardean
sense with the eye of intellect trained on the eye of faith, maugre the
bridge of the nose) she could play well too.  Amen to that.

It's not bad here.  It hasn't been too terribly hot.  The birds, as
always, are good--watched a nice little grebe wading through mossy water
then suddenly dipping its head for a treat.  I had a good time holding
forth about poetry and the perverse to students at Rollins College where
the presiding muse is Carol Frost.  It may be that some of us will go to
see Scott Momaday--a poet I've long admired who lives here abouts.

Needless to say if any Orlando poets would like to see this devil in the
flesh I'm good for a coffee.  Back-channel is perfectly fine.
