RAE ARMANTROUT and MARJORIE WELISH
RAE ARMANTROUT is the author of Veil: New and Selected Poems just recently
out from the Wesleyan Poetry Series. Veil includes work from seven previous
collections. Commenting on Veil, Publishers Weekly notes: "Those who haven'=
t
discovered the superb poems of Necromance and Made to Seem will find their
unsettling vignettes utterly compelling, alert to the vagest shades of
postmodern subjecthood." Armantrout's other books include: Precedence,
Extremities and True, her 1998 autobiographical work.

MARJORIE WELISH's books include The Windows Flew Open from Burning Deck
Press, The Annotated "Here" and Selected Poems (selected as a finalist for
the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize) from Coffee House Press, Begetting
Textile from Equipage, and a book of art criticism, Signifying Art: Essays
on Art after 1960 from Cambridge University Press. Her art criticism has
been featured in Bomb and Artforum. [8:00 pm]

y

JOS=C9 F=C9REZ KURI, MARSHALL REESE, ELLEN ZWEIG, TERRY WINTERS, PIERRE JORIS,
JASON WEISS, ONDI MCMASTER, and GERARD PAS. The anthology is edited by JASO=
N
WEISS, a Brooklyn-based writer, who is the author of Writing at Risk:

Home: A Century of Latin American Writers in Paris, forthcoming from
Routledge in 2002. He is the translator of Luisa Futoransky's The Duration
of the Voyage: Selected Poems (Junction, 1997) and Marcel Cohen's Mirrors
(Green Integer, 1998). [10:30 pm]

DECEMBER 10, MONDAY
SUZANNE WISE and REBECCA WEE
SUZANNE WISE is the author of the poetry collection The Kingdom of the
Subjunctive (Alice James Books, 2000). Her writing also appears in American
Poetry: The Next Generation (Carnegie Mellon, 2000). "I love Suzanne Wise's
poems because they're droll and cavalier, magnificent and terrified all at
once. With all the invisible poise of Masculinity-which she doesn't care to
possess-she manages to flip responsibility governing her poems so that
what's secretly driving them feels like everyone's problem. And that seems
like a grand success. As if a vast and almost patriotic distress signal wer=
e
being sent out." -Eileen Myles

REBECCA WEE's poems have been published in The Iowa Review, Ploughshares,
The Senora Review, The Mid-American Review, and others. She received her MF=
A
in poetry in 1992 from George Mason University and worked as an editorial
assistant to poet Carolyn Forche on her 1993 Norton anthology, Against
Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness. Her first book, Uncertain
Grace, published in May 2001 by Copper Canyon Press, won the 2000 Hayden
Carruth Award for New and Emerging Poets. She teaches creative writing at
Augustana College in Rock Island, IL. [8:00 pm]

Discussion Statistics, UBPoetics E-mail List
November 2001 vs. November 1998


November 1998
number of e-mails: 984
number of threads*: 174
average length of thread, adjusted to remove outliers: 3.6 e-mails
discussion, as % share of total list e-mail: 67
percent of list posts that were advertisements, announcements, job postings,
or responses to such postings: 7.5 (based on random sample of 211 e-mails)


November 2001
number of e-mails: 404
number of threads*: 38
average length of thread, adjusted to remove outliers: 2.5 e-mails
discussion, as % share of total list e-mail: 29
number of advertisements, announcements, job postings, or responses to such
postings: 65 (based on a random sample of 149 e-mails)

*-threads with more than one e-mail



In three years, according to a simple sample, e-mail volume on the UBPoetics
list has dropped to less than half of what it was. As a percentage of
volume, the length of discussion has not only become shorter in three years
by a third, overall, it seems discussion makes up about 3/5 LESS of a part
of the list now than it did 3 years ago.  Most remarkably, advertising has
increased from less than one tenth of the list to a whopping two-thirds.

Is this list trending perilously towards becoming nothing but a television
that airs only advertising, a tower of Babel, where communication has
evaporated, a place where solipsism meets marketing and substance
evaporates?  Is this what we the avant-garde and progressive poets critics
and arbiters of "the new" turned out to be?  A bunch of people who listen
only to ourselves and who have only something to say when it's time to sell
it?

Does anyone have any suggestions for the list moderators on how to rescue
this list from its downward spiral?  Does the drastic change of this list
over the last three years have anything to do with post moderation?  Or is
it just the way things go?  I'm not implying that moderation means
discussion is thrown out in favor of ads, or even that it is somehow wrong
or inappropriate.  What I AM saying is that it appears that members are
behaving differently on the UBPoetics forum--once upon a time members used
to discuss, argue, bicker even.  However the pains of communication, there
was regular and sometimes even thorough discussion.  Now for the most part
everyone just ignores one another as they click their way to promote their
latest books or readings?  Maybe those who like discussion quit and were
replaced by promoters?  WHAT HAPPENED?

A reason for discussion, perhaps, is the evolution of the use of medium
itself, its relation to poetry, criticism, analysis, and its cultural
significance?

Is this worth even me spending an hour counting things, an apparently
pedantic exercise destined the annoy the *$@% out of some of you?



Best,

Subject:      Spencer Holst (1926-2001)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  8bit

Spencer Holst died on Thanksgiving at St. Vincent's Catholic Medical
Center in lower Manhattan. The cause of death was complications of
emphysema and apparent stroke. He was 75.

His unique writings — his inventions, "Spencer Holst stories" — have
influenced and been praised by two generations of writers. His books
include On Demons [1970, with Beate Wheeler], The Language of Cats &
Other Stories [1971], Spencer Holst Stories [1976, a New York Times
"notable book"], Something to Read to Someone & Sixteen Drawings [1980,
with Beate Wheeler], Prose for Dancing [1983], The Zebra Storyteller
[1993] and Brilliant Silence [2000], the latter four still available
from Station Hill/Barrytown, Ltd. [A couple of examples included at the
end here.] Audiographics has published tapes of his readings and plans
CD collections in the future.

Spencer Holst was also an extraordinary and prolific painter in later
years and exhibited regularly with the painter Beate Wheeler, his wife.
(A painting is currently on exhibit at the Westbeth Gallery in
Manhattan.)

Spencer Holst's work gained a reputation first from the animated
readings he gave during four decades in New York cafés, and since the
1960s he has appeared widely in magazines and anthologies. He curiously
straddled very different audiences and literary milieus, mostly
published by small magazines and independent publishers but also
appearing in the popular press (e.g., The Language of Cats was a mass
market paperback).  His many devoted readers regarded him as
under-recognized, yet he received a number of awards, including, for
Spencer Holst Stories, the Hilda and Richard Rosenthal Foundation Award
in 1977 from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He
also received an award from the Foundation for Performing Arts. His work
has been translated into other languages, including Swedish, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. The charm and imaginative accessibility of his work
made one wish that his stories become universally known — it would have
to be good for the world.

He once said of himself: "In the geography of literature I have always
felt my work to be equidistant between two writers, each born in Ohio —
Hart Crane and James Thurber, but my wife says don't be silly, your
stories are halfway between Hans Christian Andersen and Franz Kafka." Or
Borges, greatly admired by Spencer and with whom he had a long
correspondence. Yet, according to his sister, Mary-Ella Holst, in the
1950s he identified with the Beats.

Spencer Holst's work was not obviously "experimental" yet he was a
storyteller who challenged narrative in many ways, sometimes reducing
story to a single sentence, as if the drama of unfolding syntax embodied
a secret of story itself.  "The bubbling Babylonian tablet came clean in
the bath of acid."  He made an art in which language has consequences,
both in ways we prefer to ignore and on levels we have yet to
acknowledge or understand.  "When she raises one eyebrow, and one
nostril rises into half a sneer, and one eye closes to a slit — watch
it!."  He felt he had invented a new kind of "very, very short story";
others felt the art he cultivated was liminal to performance and magic,
in all of its senses.  "My Reader, if you should suddenly discover that
you have this very vase in your hands, handle it with care and a certain
circumspection."  One never heard him refer to himself as a poet, but
that non-view would be hard to sustain. "I am stuck in this chair in
front of my typewriter like a fly on flypaper."

Quite different poets/writers have praised his work, including John
Cage, Jackson Mac Low, Francine Prose, Muriel Rukeyser, John Hollander,
Diane Wakoski, Donald Newlove, W.S. Merwin, Allen Ginsberg and Jerome
Rothenberg. [Quotes at the end.] A New York Times reviewer called him
"the most skilled fairy-tale artificer of our times." In one edition of
The Norton Anthology of the Short Story, his stories were the first and
the last entries. His work is increasingly taught in schools and
universities.

[The following account combines information from his family with the
only unpaid obituary so far — in The Toledo Blade — which was based on a
conversation with Mary-Ella Holst.]

Born July 7th, 1926 in Detroit, Michigan, he grew up in Rossford and
Toledo, Ohio, where his father, Lawrence Spencer "Doc" Holst, was for
many years a reporter and sports columnist (specializing in the Detroit
Tigers) for The Toledo Blade and the former Toledo Times.

At 16 he dropped out of Scott High School and ran to New York to be a
poet. He returned to Toledo but never finished school. He served in the
army at the end of World War II, remaining stateside, and worked a short
stint in the library of The Toledo Blade. Then, in 1957, he returned to
New York, determined to be a writer.  He married Beate Wheeler, an
artist as impecunious as he, and in 1970 they became charter tenants of
Westbeth, the artists’ residence on the lower West Side, where rents are
charged according to a resident’s ability to pay. There, where he lived
until his death, he played chess (frequently with John Cage during the
years he too lived there), wrote his short stories, gave readings,
painted and regularly exhibited, often with Beate Wheeler.

For money, which always was short, he did readings in bars, churches,
cafés and other paying venues across New York, as well as colleges and
universities. "He was a wonderful reader and storyteller," his sister
Mary-Ella said. "He could mesmerize an audience." And in an interesting
bit of cultural speculation, the Washington Post wrote in an article
about him in 1975: "In New York City, as in other great and expensive
cities of the world, there is a secret network of friends who conspire
to live just the way they want, quietly and gently on practically
nothing, without the system ever knowing."

Perhaps his best-know short-story collection is The Language of Cats
(incorporated in The Zebra Storyteller), in which, according to The
Saturday Review, "he creates brief but startling visions of men who are
maimed, lost, and lonely, unwarmed by the cold comforts of a scientific
age." Muriel Ruyekser offered a corrective to this view many would agree
with: "At first I thought The Language of Cats was just a book of wry,
marvelous fables.  But as I went further and began to feel entirely
different, I saw that what we have here is a mater of ecstasy."

Surviving are his wife, Beate, and sister, Mary-Ella Holst, of
Manhattan, and son, Sebastian, daughter-in-law, Dawn, and grandchildren
Spencer Robert and Adrianna Beate of Chevy Chase, Maryland.

No funeral was held; his ashes were sent to a family grave site in Ohio.
But there will be a memorial at Westbeth, probably early January, the
date to be announced.

Other comments on Spencer Holst:

"These stories are (or should be) classics; they're not merely
extraordinary, but absolutely unique. Witty, magical, immensely strange,
shimmering with paradox, Spencer Holst's stories oblige us to revise
whatever it was we thought we knew about the possibilities of
storytelling."
                        Francine Prose

"His gift is to a remarkable extent that of a storyteller in the oldest
and simplest sense.  It's not hard to imagine him telling stories on the
street corners of ancient Rome."
                        W.S. Merwin

"His sense of humor and of the macabre have earned him a special place
as wise jester of the vanguard."
                        The New York Times

"These are routines — something like fictions, something like jokes — of
a stand-up tragic.  Transcriptions of a spoken voice, their cadences
linger beyond laughter."
                        John Hollander

"Spencer Holst at his best is a goblin telling a story to an audience of
spellbound magicians.  His stories transform you into a man in an
invisible coat seeing all the secrets of the world."

Spencer Holst stories:


                         Mona Lisa Meets Buddha

    Up in heaven the curtains fluttered, the curtains fluttered, the
curtains fluttered, and the Mona Lisa entered at one end of a small
hall, which was hung with many veils.
     Up in heaven the curtains fluttered, fluttered, fluttered, and the
Buddha entered the hall at the other end.
     They smiled.



                          The Zebra Storyteller

    Once upon a time there was a Siamese cat who pretended to be a lion
and spoke inappropriate Zebraic.
     The language is whinnied by the race of striped horses in Africa.
     Here now: An innocent zebra is walking in a jungle, and approaching
from another direction is the little cat; they meet.
     "Hello there!" says the Siamese cat in perfectly pronounced
Zebraic. "It is certainly a pleasant day, isn't it?  The sun is shining,
the birds are singing, isn't the world a lovely place to live today?"
     The zebra is so astonished at hearing a Siamese cat speaking like a
zebra, why — he's just fit to be tied.
 So the little cat quickly ties him up, kills him, and drags the better
parts of the carcass back to his den.
     The cat successfully hunted zebras many months in this manner,
dining on filet mignon of zebra every night, and from the better hides
he made bow neckties and wide belts after the fashion of the decadent
princes of the Old Siamese court.
     He began boasting to friends he was a lion, and he gave them as
proof the fact that he hunted zebras.
     The delicate noses of the zebras told them that there was really no
lion in the neighborhood.  The zebra deaths caused many to avoid the
region.  Superstitious, they decided the woods were haunted by the ghost
of a lion.
     One day the storyteller of the zebras was ambling, and through his
mind ran plots of stories to amuse the other zebras, when suddenly his
eyes brightened, and he said, "That's it!  I'll tell a story about a
Siamese cat who learns to speak our language!  What an idea!  That'll
make 'em laugh."
     Just then the Siamese cat appeared before him and said, "Hello
there! Pleasant day today, isn't it!"
     The zebra storyteller wasn't fit to be tied at hearing a cat
speaking his language, because he'd been thinking about that very thing.

     He took a good a good look at the cat, and he didn't know why, but
there was something about his looks he didn't like, so he kicked him
with a hoof and killed him.
     That is the function of the storyteller.

 Did=20
Somebody Say Totalitarianism?
Five Interventions in the (Mis)use of a Notion=20
Slavoj =C5=BDi=C5=BEek
Verso, 2001
ISBN 1859847927=20
Alexei Monroe In this book Slavoj =C5=BDi=C5=BEek, the man publishers once d=
escribed=20
as "the colossus of Ljubljana," intensifies the more explicit political=20
trajectory of his recent works. This work is part of the WO ES WAR series=20
which =C5=BDi=C5=BEek edits. The raison d'etre of the series is to demonstra=
te "that=20
the explosive combination of Lacanian psychoanalysis and Marxist tradition=20
denotes a dynamic freedom that enables us to question the very=20
presuppositions of the circuit of Capital."

Such language is a provocative challenge to the "end of history" school of=20
liberal-capitalist thinking and to dumbed-down intellectual and political=20
populism. The statement raises the spectre of a dense, dry text that could=20
easily deter. Yet even when addressing fundamental political problems, =C5=
=BDi=C5=BEek=20
is far from dry and will address his points "by any means necessary" through=
=20
reference to popular film, opera or herbal tea.

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek loves to taunt liberal sensibilities, and in the introductio=
n he=20
recounts the story of an American friend staying in Bucharest after the=20
removal of Ceausescu. The friend complimented the country and the people in=20=
a=20
call to his girlfriend. Immediately after the call was finished, the=20
Securitate officer who monitored it rang to thank him for his kind comments.=
 =C5=BD
i=C5=BEek thrives on such paradox and therefore dedicates the book to the se=
cret=20
policeman in question.

What mass culture can tell us

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek's oeuvre is littered with collisions between high theory and=
 mass=20
culture and he thinks nothing of illustrating a discussion of the work of=20
F.W. Schelling with an analysis of Forrest Gump (in The Indivisible Remainde=
r=20
from 1996). =C5=BDi=C5=BEek is not concerned with the aesthetic value (or la=
ck of) in=20
such films so much as their significances and symbolisms=E2=80=94the ways in=
 which=20
such products can reveal fundamental ideological or psychological processes.

The underlying lesson of this approach may be that significance (as opposed=20
to aesthetic skill or complexity) is everywhere=E2=80=94it does not start an=
d end in=20
the art-house. Each =C5=BDi=C5=BEek text has one extended analysis of a film=
 (in this=20
case Face Off in a section entitled "John Woo as a critic of Levinas" (182)=20
in which he "pulls out all the stops," pushing at the borders of self-parody=
=20
but always remaining persuasive).=20

One of the most striking aspects of this book is its pace. In a stunning=20
section entitled "The Myth of Postmodernity" (29-39), =C5=BDi=C5=BEek cites=20=
amongst=20
others, Cindy Sherman, Spanish film, Casablanca, Kleist's "The Marquise of=20
O," Hegel, Joyce's Ulysses, the film Equus, Stravinsky's "The Rite of=20
Spring," Luther, James Bond, Nietzsche and Heidegger. The pace at which thes=
e=20
eclectic subjects are deployed and analysed is in a way appropriate to the=20
postmodern techno era of reduced attention spans and informational=20
hyper-loading.=20

The accelerated pace does not imply a dilution of content; the complex works=
=20
and references cited hardly suggest dumbing-down. If anything, =C5=BDi=C5=
=BEek's ideas=20
can seem more powerful when concentrated almost to the duration of=20
"blipverts." What's striking is how within a single paragraph =C5=BDi=C5=BEe=
k cuts to=20
the quick of a concept or a work. The accelerated style works because he has=
=20
proved more than capable of extended analysis in the past and it is soon=20
apparent that his mini-analyses don't sacrifice quality for quantity.

This techno-age metaphor suggests another image, that of the hyper-fast DJ=20
mixing and cross-fading diverse samples into fast-moving but dense collages.=
=20
This also highlights the performative nature of his work. =C5=BDi=C5=BEek is=
 as much a=20
showman as many DJs and has a repertoire of crowd-pleasing tricks: the swift=
=20
cross-fade between discussion of a Hollywood blockbuster and German=20
philosophy, or the rewind of a Lacanian motif (or should that be "sample"?).=
=20
Also present in the mix are a fair number of jokes, for instance his=20
discussion of marketing slogans such as "you get 30% free." Here he remarks,=
=20
"in such a situation I am always tempted to say: 'OK then, give me only this=
=20
free 30 per cent'" (43).

"I never knew there was so much in it!"

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek's engagement with mass culture does not amount to rehabilita=
tion, or a=20
simplistic postmodernist "so bad it's good" celebration. His approach=20
suggests that the most trivial (pop) cultural artefact can be theoretically=20
inspiring and through analysis can produce insights its creators may have=20
been completely unaware of or opposed to (particularly in the political=20
sense).

Within =C5=BDi=C5=BEek's Weltanschauung the personal is definitely political=
=E2=80=94the=20
psychological mechanisms underpinning interpersonal relations cannot be=20
isolated from those at the root of political or cultural processes, and his=20
discussions of melancholy or desire integrate fully with persuasive analyses=
=20
ideologies such as anti-Semitism (=C5=BDi=C5=BEek claims the anti-Semitic na=
rrative is=20
a means of accounting for the chaotic nature of reality), nationalism or=20
political and academic correctness. This skill at describing the most=20
esoteric and intangible of psychological and symbolic processes is as=20
indispensable to his analyses of politics as to his work on film.

Conformity and resistance in the academy

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek mounts an attack on a series of dominant concepts that he ar=
gues=20
distort our understanding of totalitarianism and the political field. As in=20
his recent study of Kieslowski (<A HREF=3D"http://www.ce-review.org/01/28/bo=
oks28_monroe">read CER's review</A>) and The Ticklish Subject=20
(1999), there is a broadside against "New Age obscurantists," an "adversary"=
=20
mentioned in his work increasingly often (here he audaciously claims their=20
thinking is "an immanent outgrowth of modern science itself," 215).

He begins by analysing the language used on the box of an American herbal=20
tea, which describes how the antioxidants it contains are used to tame=20
harmful free radicals. In a masterful stroke he uses this as a metaphor for=20
the way in which the notion of totalitarianism is (ab)used to tame radical=20
thought, acting as a Denkverbot=E2=80=94a mechanism for preventing thought:=20
> "the moment one accepts the notion of 'totalitarianism' one is firmly=20
> located within the liberal-democratic horizon." (3)


However, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek is not alone in his critique of totalitarianism. So=
me=20
Anglo-American scholars are also questioning it, if not for ideological=20
reasons then because it is too simplistic a model to describe the realities=20
of the former Eastern bloc (see for example Style and Socialism: Modernity=20
and Material Culture in Post-War Eastern Europe, eds Reid and Crowley,=20
Oxford: Berg, 2000)
Criticising isms
Throughout the book, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek draws attention to what he sees as the=20=
enfeebled=20
state of debate in an academy structured by a series of prohibitions, the=20
violation of which can have dire consequences=E2=80=94he hints at (though he=
 does not=20
provide examples of) papers rejected or jobs refused. Having identified such=
=20
codes, he goes on to challenge them spectacularly:=20
> "The first thing to do, therefore, is fearlessly to violate these liberal=20
> taboos: So what if one is accused of being 'anti-democratic', 'totalitaria=
n'
> =E2=80=A6" (3)


Besides New Agers and liberals, others on his "hitlist" are advocates of=20
feminism, postmodernism and "pseudo-leftist irrationalism" (7). He claims=20
that transgression is now officially encouraged and that "if one wants to=20
identify the hegemonic intellectual trend, one should simply search for the=20
trend that claims to pose an unprecedented threat to the hegemonic power=20
structure" (141).
One of the fascinating aspects of the =C5=BDi=C5=BEek phenomenon is that des=
pite (or=20
perhaps because of) all his provocations he has gained a significant=20
following among those that he attacks in his works. If we consider how he=20
gets away with it=E2=80=94infilitrating centres of bourgeois liberalism such=
 as Radio=20
4's "Start The Week" programme=E2=80=94an interesting possibility arises. As=
 he has=20
said of Laibach, people and ideas coming from "the Balkans"/ex-Yugoslavia ar=
e=20
affected by Western stereotypes of Balkan primitivism.
If, as he claims, contemporary academia is bound by unwritten laws, it is=20
possible that his violation of these is only tolerated because of his=20
"Balkan" status. More indulgence may be offered to him as an exotic=20
"outsider" than to an equally iconoclastic Western thinker, particularly if=20
they were to describe themselves as =C5=BDi=C5=BEek has as a "Stalinist" (a=20
semi-ironic reference to his theoretical dogmatism).=20

Totalitarianism examined

In relation to totalitarianism, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek covers topics such as the ro=
le of the=20
Holocaust in contemporary culture, the Frankfurt School and Western Marxism,=
=20
Havel, the Stalinist show trials and two favoured examples of his: the GDR=20
and the Yugoslav self-management system.=20

Revelling as he does in paradox and irony, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek's analysis of Sta=
lin's=20
purges is particularly striking. He claims that what the purges actually=20
concealed was "a total incapacity to govern the country through 'normal'=20
authority and executive measures" (119) and that the elevation of the leader=
=20
to the status of a genius able to pronounce on any and all subjects had a=20
paralysing effect upon the functioning of country subject to such a cult,=20
also hinting at the corrosive effects of leadership cults in any context.=20=
=C5=BDi=C5=BE
ek points out the irony of the 1938 "meta-purge" (120) in which Yezhov, head=
=20
of the NKVD, was actually charged with killing thousands of innocent=20
Bolsheviks (who =C5=BDi=C5=BEek claims had in a sense betrayed the revolutio=
n by=20
becoming the nomenklatura.)

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek also discusses the work of Shostakovitch, challenging simpli=
stic=20
(liberal) notions of dissidence. He takes particular issue with the=20
oxymoronic concept of covert dissidence, as he says, "the very essence of a=20
dissident act is that it is public" (125). As he has argued elsewhere,=20
maintaining a private inner distance or cynicism towards the system actually=
=20
helps the system and it is those who take an ideology literally that pose a=20
greater threat. He sees Shostakovitch's achievement not in his supposed=20
hidden musical dissidence but in the fact that he articulated his own=20
cowardice and inner conflict in relation to the system and claims that the=20
8th String Quartet=E2=80=94written when he finally joined the party=E2=80=
=94is the music of=20
a broken man.

Subsequently he challenges the liberal understanding of dissidence, drawing=20
out an aspect generally overlooked:=20
> "the very space from which [dissidents] themselves criticized and denounce=
d=20
> the day-to-day terror and misery was opened and sustained by the Communist=
=20
> breakthrough, by its attempt to escape the logic of Capital... when=20
> dissidents like Havel denounced the existing Communist regime on behalf of=
=20
> authentic human solidarity, they (unwittingly, for the most part) spoke=20
> from the place opened up by Communism itself=E2=80=94this is why they tend=
 to be so=20
> disappointed when 'actually existing capitalism' does not meet the high=20
> expectations of their anti-Communist struggle. Perhaps Vaclav Klaus,=20
> Havel's pragmatic double, was right when he dismissed Havel as a=20
> 'socialist'." (130)


At this point some will accuse =C5=BDi=C5=BEek of belittling the victims of=20=
Stalinist=20
systems, yet he argues that Marxists should not be afraid to acknowledge the=
=20
irrationalism of the purges and notes that "the Communist regimes, in their=20
positive content, were mostly a dismal failure, generating terror and misery=
"=20
(130). Such failure was, he claims, judged against the systems' own utopian=20
dreams and for this reason Stalinism even at its worst "exudes an=20
emancipatory potential" (131). Perhaps some residual awareness of this plays=
=20
a part in the current London trend for clothes decorated with the logos of=20
Cuba or the USSR. However unpalatable to some, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek's position co=
mpels him=20
to insist on the lost utopian value even of failed revolutionary projects.=20
From the Balkans to The Matrix
In the closing section, =C5=BDi=C5=BEek identifies the present forms of "the=
 spectre=20
of 'totalitarianism': "evil dictators" such as Milo=C5=A1evic, New Right pop=
ulism=20
in the West and "the digital Big Brother," noting that "soon, our daily live=
s=20
will be registered and controlled to such an extent that the former police=20
state control will look like a childish game: the 'end of privacy'" is in=20
sight (229).
=C5=BDi=C5=BEek gives a detailed commentary on ex-Yugoslavia. He identifies=20=
two=20
"prejudices" that shaped the views of the Western left: that Yugoslav=20
self-management really worked and that small nations like Slovenia and=20
Croatia naturally regress to a proto-Fascist state if left unsupervised.
He goes on to make a key statement, worth quoting in full:=20
> "The ultimate irony of such a nostalgic Leftist longing for the lost=20
> Yugoslavia is that it ends up identifying as the successor of Yugoslavia=20
> the very force that killed it: the Serbia of Milo=C5=A1evic. In the=20

He also notes the way in which the death of Tudman and the (predicted)=20

=C5=BDi=C5=BEek's verdict on the Western interventions (characterised by=20

The Precious Cool Beans

She is singing the anthem for some kooky people.
He strides in as the beautiful one, well-lighted
With the chiseled features we want him for.
It is not late, yet.  She is putting her
Heart into it, the song called "Flip."  An
Occasion piece mired in irrelevance.
We acknowledge her passion, though
The peanut gallery in our souls winces.
The rain outside is green and hits the angled windows
Like clumps of seaweed or the terrifying implements
Used in car washes.  The cleft-chinned, high-cheeked,
Comely one withdraws, playing the Goth.
He feels as if the spirits are ballroom dancing
On his spleen.  It is the fashionable time for
Melancholy, to bathe in the blues like it's a party
For woe.  The raspberries on the plate are
Recuperative this time.  The song "Flip" enters
Its final movement and the anxious crowd fidgets.
"Your prize is sentience, Olivia, presiding over
The precincts of flux."  An unexpected end, but
Welcome, the audience thinks.  A departure from
The libretto derived from a press release!  Relief
Sifts through the people like an unclaimed fragrance;
no,
Not relief but satisfaction.

                                "Will you come and be my love,
Be fruitful, multiply--fructify or bust!--" the
beautiful one asks
The singer.  His question presages such connubial
Bliss the crowd showers them with the aperitif, cool
beans
Including those of the garbanzo variety...

It is a story I know well, I tell the retired
reporters.
I mopped the floors that night.  Slopping up those
Wretched legumes.  How I had loved her!

Folks -- wondering if any of you in the NYC area, particularly in Manhattan
but flexible, might know of a writing and possibly painting space available
during the day, for a few days during the week, for the next 6 months to a
year.  I don't need much space but I need uninterrupted time; if there were
a room in an apt., say, free during business hours 2-5 days a week, that
might be ideal, or some kind of shared studio space.

Thanks so much for any leads!  -- Maureen McLane

Have you read Merrill's _The Changing Light at Sandover_?  I assume so
because if the Ouija board thing.  Merrill's long poem is about contacts
with spirit guides through a Ouija board.  I liked the first book, but I got
sick of the newaginess of later portions of the work, and didn't finish the
rest.  That's probably the wrong word to use as Merrill was not at all a new
age type, but I'm referring to the theology which was made up out of (it
seemed to me) slogans and funny labels for things (for instance God was
called God B for God Biology, which struck me as a shallow borrowing from
the current interest in biology as the cause of everything, and I also found
the term to be too cute.)  I did like other aspects of the work, like the
realistic parts about Merrill and his partner and their friends (dead and
alive) and the characterization of Ephraim, the first spirit who
communicated with Merrill.

In general I like Merrill a lot.  "The Broken Home" is a particular favorite
for personal, not poetic reasons (I was subject to a custody battle as a
child).  But the poem has some great images, like the description of
Merrill's father's ex-wives orbiting in sable around him at the funeral.

As usual when posting here I am in mortal fear of saying something
exceptionally stupid.  This list is intimidating with all its poets...

Millie

I suppose they need the admission fee to fund the prize since University
administrations are unlikely to care.  But I do share Bob's annoyance.  What
jumps out most is the list of former winners.  Name recognition seems to be
an important factor here.  I'm not bitching, just noting -- but I wonder if
this award is any different from so many others in terms of how winners are
selected.  Even in the case of somewhat blind submissions, "adjustments" are
often made before the winner is announced.  I also find unfortunate that some
award competitions keep the judges' identities secret.  Having this
information up front might save a lot of people from wasting a reading fee.
Of course, the secret is meant to guard against just this little thing.  The
Award depends on getting as many entries as possible.  I'll be interested to
see if the winner is someone few recognize or if, once again, a "Sharon Olds
brand name" takes top honors.  Whatever, good luck to all who must take the
plunge.  Best, Bill

no-thing samadhi


you don't see the universe in a grain of sand; you see a grain of sand in
the universe. you may name the grain queen or king, prince or princess,
president or premier; you may give it a proper name, akiko, jonathan; you
accomplish nothing. you see a rug with its weaving and name a particular
loop friend or foe; you understand nothing. names are delusion; they close
around particulars; they define particulars. they close around the world
and structure it; the assume totality in the wildflower, totality in the
grain of sand. they assume the world is all that is the case; there is no
case, no world.

you don't see any-thing. you see the symbolic; you see function. the world
is defined as the sum of its parts. a part is part of the whole. the whole
may be greater than the sum of its parts. the parts can be summed. the
parts can be substituted, rearranged, created, annihilated, transformed.
the whole can be substituted, rearranged, created, annihilated, trans-
formed. the play of symbols is the play of abstract mathesis, the play of
abstract ontology. it is the play of no-thing. it is exact, and exactitude
may be at the service of inexactitude. within the chaotic domain, things
are determined; within the stochastic domain, envelopes are relatively or
roughly determined.

there is no universe in a grain of sand. there is no world in a wild-
flower. there is no grain of sand, no wild-flower. you see everything in a
universe that reflects structure in everything. structure coalesces, coag-
ulates - fields, intensifications, energies, fundamental forces. in the
grain of sand, structure devolves. on the way down, structure devolves.
your body is devolution; your body is coagulation, intensity; your mind,
your antibodies, the raising of your arms, ward off boundary dissolution.
appearance nearly decomposes; the boundaries are of a making. the boundar-
ies are of a dissolution. there is no cessation; there is transformation;
there is asymptotic devolvement. the constriction-coagulation, the cont-
ract of names, is always already forgotten. there is no-thing to forget.
there is no-thing to remember; the universe is neither imaginary nor real.

The San Francisco State University Poetry Center Prize has had many fine
and varied
recipients over the years.   It is no way a "name brand" contest.
Obviously the names are known by the judge who is reading books.  No one
is forced to enter the contest either.

As for a reading fee, the university does not support the prize.

Maxine Chernoff,
Prof of Creative Writing.

Millie. I havent read Changing Light at Sandhover but James Merrill is
certainly a great poet: quite different eg to John Ashbery although the
connections to W
H Auden is explored in  "Remaking it New" by Lyn Keller... I think that's
the book. Merrill writes some beautiful poems and like Auden he was
obviously highly intelligent: some I think have found him too difficult or
possibly deliberately "obscurantist"  but there re many poets that I find
"difficult" (in different ways) but the poetry is so great that one's
bafflement, or possibly one's initial bafflement, could be aprt of the
proces of enjoying...or "eating" the poem. One poem is predicated on the
Cupid and Psyche myth which is in Apuleius's  "The Golden Ass" (a book I'm
currently reading). I think that Merrill revelled in intellectual subtlety,
as did Auden (although the latter's later poems are apparently
"transparent") but he loved words and language and the subtle beauty of
thought: and of course emotion.
  I have a friend who actually reads "Changing Light..." because he either
believes (or wants to because he wants to think he is or can communicate
with a close family member through the "oiuji board" or whatever way)... but
undoubtedly also because it's a major modern poem.  I found it difficult and
simply too vast but I intend to get hold of it again when I have time.
 Look (I know I'm "butting in") but Millie - if I was worried whether all
the accos and poets on the list and people I've criticised or been blasted
by or
all the stupid things I've said or am/are/was/did say saying I'd never do
anything: just express your views: if the Moderator wants to cut it, its up
to him/her (but ingeneral the problem is simply that not enough people are
either humble enough or arrogant enough or self-confident enough or crazy
enough or normal enough to express their thoughts): I have done so, very
often I think...why the hell did I say that? Sometimes I regret it but I
NEVER apologise. What I say I say: get confident and have your say....this
connects to what Patrick Herron is saying bout the lack of discussion which
I think is people (partly, partly its very time consuming) not entering into
real discussions: there was one last year on the Langos etc another centred
around langauage (metaphor and mtonomy) and a few others...I enjoyed jawing
on about what was poetry, how to define it, and so on....but see Patrick's
pennyworth. but dont worrry what other people think: just write. Even send
in some poems. (We all talk crap - its the quality of one's crap that
counts!!) Look, I'm just a tired old book seller and ex- technitian, but I
clash swords with great intellectual and creative giants such as George
Bowering, Pierre Joris, Ron Silliman, Arrielle Greenberg, Joe Brennan, Bill
Austin, Kevin Killian, Wystan Curnow,harry Nudel, Joe Amato, Marjorie
Perloff, and Scott Hamilton. Regards,
Richard.

Subject:      Take 2: Senior Poet Job

dear poetics persons,

below is the slightly revised description of a senior
poet job here at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee.
the difference is that we can now also consider people
with the 'terminal' MFA, not only those with the PHD.
this is a big changing program (60+ graduate students),
that hired me year before last and hired a fiction
writer this past year, in a big changing department with
9 new hires last year.

the only catch is that we're in a hurry: DEC 15 2001
deadline.

thanks,
lisa samuels

Please join us for an event celebrating the beautiful and groundbreaking

"Chax Press consistently affords its committed following the opportunity
to experience vital, energetic works that expand the boundaries of
literature while exemplifying excellence within the chosen forms.  Works
emerging from the Press... display a fusion of linguistic adventure and
integrity, and often brave experiment, that reveals the capacity of writer
and reader alike to locate places heretofore undefined. " Chax Press
authors Todd Baron, David Bromige, Beverly Dahlen, Kathleen Fraser, Lyn
Hejinian, Benjamin Hollander, Myung Mi Kim, Walter Lew, Nathaniel Mackey,
Kit Robinson, Hugh Steinberg, and Elizabeth Treadwell join Chax Press
Director, poet, and book artist Charles Alexander for a celebratory

"SWOON is perfect." -Eileen Myles

"Fabulous, compulsive reading: proof of the ability of love and need and
even writing to trump the crappiness of daily life." -Chris Kraus

"A magnificent achievement, these 300 pages were culled from over 5,000 of
email and hard-mail correspondence generated within a year between two
sharp-minded poets, ranging in genre from mutually consoling letters,
lyricalanguage poetry of a very high order of accomplishment, erotic
fantasy-vignettes, and physical descriptions of place and everyday life. At
every moment, they make for a captivating and illuminating reading
experience." -Maria Damon

"The pleasures of this book are varied, more varied than any book of poems
by a single author in over a decade, but at the center of it is a love that
is as pure as it is theatrical ... SWOON manages to revitalize the art of
romance and romanticism ..." -Chris Stroffolino

Poetry. Correspondence. Beginning in the fall of 1998, the poet Nada Gordon,
then living in Tokyo, and poet/cartoonist Gary Sullivan, who'd moved to New
York the previous year, began a daily correspondence that culminated in
April of 1999 with Gordon's return to the U.S. after 11 years in Japan.
SWOON is documentary, love story, poetry, collaborative essay and auto- (or
duo-) biography all rolled into one. Written almost inadvertently, it
documents the tenacity of love, and shows how it survives - with language as
its host - even in inhospitable conditions.

I "butted in" to something Millie was saying about Merrill and his poem =
"Cahanging Light At Sandhover" which I also found to long and (for me) =
too obscure. But here is one of a series of poems I wrote some time ago, =
apropos of nothing. I started writing a fictitious "converation" (maybe =
I was thinking a bit of Berryman) between a cockroach and the editor of =
the New York Times (which is a bit bizarre because I hardly ever read =
that mag these days and have only been to Manhatten briefly: in fact it =
was my only visit to anywhere  outside NZ apart from Fiji) Anycase I  =
wrote this one which mentions Merrill's poem. Of course the whole =
thing's 'tongue-in -cheek' as they say:

                 COCROACH POEM 27

"Look Roach, you need to take a turn about, stop
worrying about the Exclusion Principle
or James Merrill's  "Changing Light at Sandhover",
Or Ashbery's "Three Poems", or Proust, or  David Jones
Or the Nyquist Diagram as it applies to positive and negative feedback. =
Shove it
into a corner for a while. Go for a massage, get laid."
The Editor's face was quite red, and he was
s-sweating. The room seemed to spin
in opposing directions, as if in a struggle=20
to unknit the quantum quandry. There was=20
a blurr of motion, Roach felt vertiginous. But
he managed to cry out: "What we were we are and what we are we were!"
It was magic - everything seized.
Roach stared fixedly at Ed, whom he called Word Man. "Sometimes
I look up the answers to my poems after I've written them." He quipped =
slyly.
Editor got up, paced, and swore: "Shit!" he expleted. But Roach wanted =
to go on:
"There are eternities of ice,
and they struggle toward morning who wriggle insinuate, twinely now,
and the horse bursting into everything starting again.....
the eternal television adverts: how man is a dot."
Editor said nothing.=20

Bill Etal. I entered a competition for a book publishing and it cost me
US$80. I entered because I thought; well this is a good way to get organised
with some old material I had. In "my bones" I knew that Lyn Heijinian (whom
by the way I admire greatly as a poet) who was the judge wouldnt really like
the style of what I sent: although one never knows. But I also entered in
the vague hope of winning US$1000.00  Now it was (admittedly remotely)
possible even though I am a New Zealander that I  COULD have won. I assume
very many entered and thus we are looking at probabilities etc. No way for
me to know what went on as there has been no info re the comp (they said
they would not return manuscripts). I dont even know who won! Or even if my
work got there! Or any helpful or critical or otheerwise comments: nothing.
Actually it cost me more than US$80 and I cant afford that sort of money
very much.
  But on balance I dont regret it. I dont think I will be entering any more
competitions again in any country as in many cases the results ARE rigged OR
even if not I feel increasingly that I have to be my own self-approver and
judge.
  None of this is to say that some very deserving people dont win prizes.
The story of John Ashbery's "debut" into publishing is interesting: he says
of it in an interview with John Tranter that he was lucky that Auden knew
someone he knew and so on (it was a toss up between him and O'Hara both
great poets).....
  But now I do my own work (if I get time) and give the odd reading and
"publish" mainly by putting stuff on this List. I have to admit I could be
more energetic about publishing or getting into journals but either I'm
"disillusioned " or I'm just bored or I'm struggling to make a few bob I
dont know....but I have my concerns about competitions.
  Take sport: I enjoy a good game or boxing match (watching safely on the
side I mean!) or cricket or whatever and have to admit that I love winning
chess WHEN I win but then the game has to be significant; has to have a
degree of struggle: and/but  poetry is a creative thing and very unjudgeable
I think in general: I think that a creative artist of whatever ilk has to
believe vastly in him/herself. Competitions I will avoid. Regards, and all
the best for Chrsitmas Bill  (and all other List People of whatever
ethnicity or nationality or ilk and regardless of all bitter or non bitter
or stupid or otherwise words spoken on recent political events whichever
way) and so on. Cheers, Richard.

Derrida, Faith and Knowledge, 1994, p 24 -


Like others before, the new 'wars of religion' are unleashed over the
human earth (which is not the world) and struggle even today to control
the sky _with finger and eye_: digital systems and virtually immediate
panoptical visualization, 'air space', telecommunications satellites,
information highways, concentration of capitalistic-mediatic power - in
three words, _digital culture, jet_ and _TV_ without which there could be
no religious manifestation today, for example no voyage or discourse of
the Pope, no organized emanation _<rayonnement>_ of Jewish, Christian, or
Muslim cults, whether 'fundamentalist' or not.

What the Engine Does, of the Anorectic Airliner

The Engine swallows the air; it is the point at which the movement of air
and its dispersion begins. This is an act of devouring, gorging, the
bulimic cycle which collapses as the world is absorbed. It is a
transformation into substance as the Engine appropriates the foundations
of the signifier for itself. What an appropriation! The Engine inscribes
the absorbed world in an exhaust trail. The Engine parallels the photon;
it refuses position as the tokenization of existence; it exists as
movement and collapse. Thus it flies and desires the air. Thus it
appropriates and seduces the air, through an act of violence which retains
its position of flight. For that which would escape it, Engine, cruise
missile, bomb, what is being said but the "I" of the engine, within a
dialectic of seduction?  Seduction in which the Origin is proclaimed, and
that is the metric established as Origin, the location of the phallus. The
cruise missile cocks its head, gives it to the world. It is semen which is
disorganized;  the world burns into paste through an atmosphere of paste,
through an Engine of paste. The world burns, the Engine burns, swells,
disgorges; it is the world returned to vomit.The anorectic airliner
shudders (therefore shudders); the line of flight is re-established. Such
an establishment with markings in the sky! Such a sky that establishes
itself as a graph with mobile coordinates, exhaust that indicates while it
dissipates, is absorbed in the clutter of the air. The tiny Engine! The
presence of Flight! The erection in the sky and the charred earth! It is
the appearance of the microtechnological once again, the bacteriophage
with its consonant and identical units. It is an empty circle. It is the
exhaustion of repetitive expansion.

In answer to your question of "WHAT HAPPENED?" There were two problems
that changed the nature of this list.

One was a group of folks who said innumerable things and were removed or
else decided to ban themselves. This issue was deadened by the
participants, here and elsewhere.

Before this there was a discussion about Dorn in which people said
negative, unsubstantiated claims, when people were well aware of his
health problems. In my travels since this occasion, many have told me of
how they stopped participating, reading, or dropped the list due to this
situation. The diversity of the list viewers changed after this
instance, probably participants as well. I never went back to check.

Two other factors worth mentioning are:

The rise in participation on other lists, which makes sense.

The publication of the poetix book, which was taken by some as an
exclusionary tactic designed to promote certain individuals. This one I
am not sure about as I never had a copy of the book arrive in our box.
From a brief perusal, a few years back, certainly many discussions were
not brought up; however, a certain amount of this is excusable due to
the publication of a finite physical object paired from an enormous
base, and while I suppose it would have been nice to appear, I was well
aware of the list's nature before joining.

Be well

Dear neighbor/Millie,

Thanks for tossing my message-in-a-bottle back into
the waves with your own crying-into-the-wind stuffed
into it.

Yes, I have read Merrill's ~Changing Light.~  I expect
he must've known of my ouija board translation source
too because, well, he was reliably literate (and
aristocratically thin!), so I suspect that I'm
translating an unacknowledged model for ~Sandover.~ (.
. . although I'm being cagey about what I'm working on
because it's by a very well-known author and I don't
want anybody else to "beat me to the punch" on it.)

Don't be afraid of appearing dumb here on the Buffalo
List, Millie. (. . . although Merrill's association
with rhyme-&-meter formalism did station him one foot
in the "conservative" camp of poetry that the List's
"opposed" to.  And we're not supposed to talk abt. him
or like him.  Banned in Buffalo.  Basically, I think
Merrill's extreme personal ~weirdness~ redeems him,
and that his formalism ultimately comes down to a type
of quirkiness, like Gerard Manley Hopkins' (Imagine!
Hopkins was trying to be ~helpful!~ and hoped he was
making things ~clearer~ by putting all those kooky
diacritical marks all over the type) or John
Wheelwright's, some sort of rococo attempt at
self-control that only further "opaques" the writing
by unsuccessfully trying to inhibit and contradict his
driving idiosyncracies: any millionaire who would,
completely un-self-consciously and unapologetically,
write a long poem filled with classical illusions abt.
his ~house keeper~ Urania! is odd enough to be let
through the metal detectors, I think.) Your syntax
betrays your intelligence.

Excellent.  Thanks for the front-side opportunity for discussion, David.

It does seem apparent that "a group" of people either were removed OR left
OR withdrew themselves from discussion.  But why?  Mean things were said and
feelings were hurt, but isn't that a part of fully vested discussion?

I would guess my question here is a polarizing one.  As a born and bred
Yankee who's lived in the Southern US for 12 years, I live this tension,
between speaking one's mind at the risk of offending someone and withdrawing
one's barbed speech at the risk of avoiding full disclosure.  I was raised
to speak my mind come hell or high water, and that does not go over too well
in North Carolina.  It seems always to come down to a choice between
perceived personal barriers and the exhaltation of ideas.

I do believe there's a way short of moderation that can walk the fine line
between these two things.

So I'm hearing that discussion crushed discussion.  Bottom line.  This just
doesn't make sense.  Some people said mean things about Dorn, but there
still was discussion, and lots of it, however flawed or rude.

Now, the poetix book, that's to me a very compelling point.  I do think
there's something about establishing one's literary presence, etc., involved
here.  The fact that this list disintegrated into a place to advertise
reveals this sort of power play in its most unabashed form.  Pure marketing.

Yes there was an attrition to other lists, but again that doesn't explain
*why* people would begin to find the grass greener elsewhere.  Also, someone
backchannelled me to let me know the same sort of thing has happened with
brit-po?  So where are they going?  Maybe it's that people run away from
discussions that hurt their feelings or challenge their opinions?  I can see
that.

I run another list and there is such little discussion on it.  I've tried to
encourage people to post poems to the list, in the hopes that some amount of
critical review (I like this, I don't like that, why do you do that, etc.)
would happen.  The last time I said something negative about someone's poem,
which was on another list entirely, that person who I like very much has not
spoken to me since.  It's very creepy.  Even now I'm hesitant because I feel
like I'm dealing with eggs.  What I'm seeing is that people on every list
are reluctant to discuss.

I beleive I am witnessing poetics discussion dissolve *everywhere* on the
internet though I realize this is only an intuition and I don't have the
data to back it up.

I am reminded by an article by Dana Gioia in the Atlantic many years back
(http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/poetry/gioia/gioia.htm), namely that for
some reason or other (take your pick), regardless of affiliation, criticism
(re: candor) has all but disappeared from the face of poetry.  I honestly
cannot remember the last critical poetry book review I read.  Every book
review I read these days, whether it be about a new formalist or a language
poet, seems to end like a high school newspaper sports article.  That is, it
ends with some kissing little egregious congratulatory note, like some
literary high watermark of achievement has been reached.  Not EVERY book can
be that good (and don't tell me that the ones that aren't so good just never
get published, or that "good" and "bad" are paltry and therefore everythig
is good or that people only review books they love).  Nearly every review I
come across is not unlike the reviews I find in Barnes & Noble circulars,
where the aim is strictly to sell books.  It seems nearly everyone's afraid
to say "I don't like this" or "this is not very good."  I know people can't
possibly love everything they read.  Poeple can't all feel that some amount
of saying "this part is weak" or "I don't like this because..." or "I would
try it this way" is always harmful.  (Are egos that fragile?)  And so when
people who are accustomed to an environment of either constant backslapping
or silence suddenly hear negative commentary, which is part of candid (and
sometimes belligerent) conversation, things break down.  I beleive things
SHOULD NOT break down but get stronger.  But they do break down.  Why?  Was
Gioia right about a general fear of criticism?

I guess I should note that in referring to Gioia's article I don't mean to
affiliate myself with Gioia or all of the ideas set forth in his article.  I
should not have to say that, but I know from experience that things are too
Balkanized in the po-world to be taken otherwise.

When I get rejections or acceptances for publication, the actual amount of
critical insight is always less than a paragraph (with one shining
exception), and usually shorter than a sentence.  It's driving me crazy, and
I cannot escape the feeling that everyone in the Po-world is playing some
sort of game.  I just want better poetry, as unattainable and ill-defined as
that may be.  I want developed opinions and I get instead evasions or other
indications that people are reluctant to engage in critical evaluation.  (As
an aside, someone said I should get an MFA and that way I won't feel this
need anymore, but that comment says quite a bit!  That I have to purchase
criticism, that people are burnt out on negativity after MFA programs, etc.)
I can't help but feel this reluctance is related to what is going on with
this and other e-mail lists.  Maybe discussion itself does destroy
discussion, or rather, it prompts its other, the suspicion or repression of
discussion.  And I cannot help but think of Hannah Arendt's idea about
supervision, surveillance, and the function of perceived personal space,
that surveillance itself makes people less willing to freely participate,
that the right to do this or that becomes meaningless in the face of being
watched.

Patrick--

In answer to your question of "WHAT HAPPENED?" There were two problems
that changed the nature of this list.

One was a group of folks who said innumerable things and were removed or
else decided to ban themselves. This issue was deadened by the
participants, here and elsewhere.

Before this there was a discussion about Dorn in which people said
negative, unsubstantiated claims, when people were well aware of his
health problems. In my travels since this occasion, many have told me of
how they stopped participating, reading, or dropped the list due to this
situation. The diversity of the list viewers changed after this
instance, probably participants as well. I never went back to check.

Two other factors worth mentioning are:

The rise in participation on other lists, which makes sense.

The publication of the poetix book, which was taken by some as an
exclusionary tactic designed to promote certain individuals. This one I
am not sure about as I never had a copy of the book arrive in our box.
>From a brief perusal, a few years back, certainly many discussions were
not brought up; however, a certain amount of this is excusable due to
the publication of a finite physical object paired from an enormous
base, and while I suppose it would have been nice to appear, I was well
aware of the list's nature before joining.

Be well

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for your lovely, Bourdievian numbers.  (Your
on-List silence had been noticeable. I heard you hurt
your shin.  Condolences.  And I was worried that maybe
your silence meant you were cooking up some sort of
mischievous heteronym!  :)  I'm relieved to see you're
putting your time to good use.)  Something seems
muddled with your statistics for advertisements,
though: 7.5 doesn't seem to correspond to 65,
numerically, and you might've done better to stick it
out for an additional count of 62 (= 214 - 149), I
think, especially with randomness, as comparison
between samples of unequal size involve chi-factors or
r or something . . . but otherwise, I find these
numbers neo-Pythagorean in their sense of "beauty is
truth, truth beauty, that is all you know on earth and
all you need to know," and charming.

I felt tempted to do the same myself --- but upping
nutritional supplements of Vitamin Shoppe 1500 MG
Amino Complex to 10 tabs a day seems to have moderated
my counting mania --- and I was more interested in
plotting ~who~ responds to ~whose~ posts and threads,
for more of an analysis of power and
follow-the-leader.

I also find the number of advertisements distressing.
It's like being on one of those servers with pop-up
ads that keep cluttering the screen.  One waste of
time there, for me, is that poetry-dvertisers do not
as a rule mark their subject header with their
location,--- so I waste clicks opening ads for
interesting poets' readings that are then
disappointingly unreachable in far-away States I can't
attend (given the impounding of my private jet), not
that I ever leave the house anyway.  So, (#1) I think
it wld. at least be thoughtful of advertisers to mark
location in subject header, . . . although I can
understand that reputation accumulates through the
redundancy of name, and why anyone wld. be motivated
just to infiltrate Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein
Gertrude Stein at every loophole, "fame"-building.

I've wondered if Christopher W. Alexander or Prof.
Bernstein couldn't somehow "cordon off" or segregate
ads from poetics discussion.  In print, ads are
generally separated to the margins and not
interspersed with "articles."  --- Pedagogically,
insofar as the List is State U. educational outreach,
it's like mixing in Save Fifty Cents coupons with
class notes. --- Electronically, segregation might be
effort, though (develop a co-site/cache), . . . but
maybe not all that much effort: even free servers like
Yahoo provide instantaneous group resources that
poetry-advertisers cld. be given a one-time "warning"
to post to, for those interested to consult, and then
otherwise summarily blocked/deleted (as exploitative,
mercenary, whatever).  I've even considered as public
"penance" taking it upon myself to maintain an on-line
Poetry Calendar such items could be re-directed to and
plotted more helpfully, systematically, the way Sharon
Matling (name?) single-handedly started the NYC Poetry
Calendar as a 2-sided broadsheet that became a
company.

I do strongly agree that it wld. improve readering for
ads to be segregated somehow.


There's something terribly ~American~ in this
anti-social Buy This/Go There panhandling that's done
on-List, by poets (communicators!) who have total
impunity abt. addressing a community only to try to
change peers into audience.  Very lively, daily
discussion (although abt. work of a different "taste"
than the Buff' List's) goes on at PoetryEtc, for
example, which is predominately UK and AU/NZ sign-ons,
who don't seem as thoroughly ~permeated by
mercantilism~ as Americans.

I'm very easily manipulated by advertisements (which
is why I don't watch television or go to the movies,
and have trouble with newspapers and magazines), ---
psychology finds that some types are objectively more
"hypnotizable" by ads/promos! --- and it's distressing
to find my relation to poetry being bent into docile
consumerism: I spend, easily, between a hundred and
two hundred a month on poetry, average, much of it via
SPD or checks to on-List book/journal advertisers.
That's okay but, once upon a time, my naive attachment
to poetry was because an endlessly re-readable enigma
masterpiece and nothing but paper and pen/typewriter
was a ~refuge~ from consumerism.

But it isn't only the alienation that poets are
dousing colleagues with here that bothers me (I find
it tacky if the automatic footer at the bottom of a
poet's discussion post leads to a book of theirs and a
price for where to send for it, too): it's the lack of
~creativity,~ or imagination, or even--- guile! in how
matter-of-factly and mass media-like they style their
"Satisfy Me" commands.  Utopian, I think it's holding
back a potential new ~poetry~ of inventive free market
gamesmanship, a "litvertizing," as it were, where
poetry would grown into being ironically/ambiguously
conjoined with the zeitgeist of
advertisement-seduction.  What were all those names of
friends doing in New York School poetry, if not a
collective stategy of shared advertising and
name-redundancy?  (How ~could~ Bill Berkson be
advertised on-List this week if, in the golden age of
genuine inspired "litvertizing," Frank O'Hara hadn't
paved a reptutation for him by dint of including his
name in O'Hara immortality?) Forgive me if it seems
vain of me to use myself as an example, but it took
much more than an hour to put together and post my
shoddy little

http://www.geocities.com/jeffreyjullich/EUNOIAN.LITTLE.LEXICON.htm
,

with no self-interest in Bok's reputation other than I
genuinely find him to be among the two or three most
remarkable.  It was advertising, though, disinterested
advertising, labor-intensive advertising. And I was
lead to doing that, and to ordering Bok's book and to
hearing him on the ~Cabinet~ CD as a result of Brian
Kim Stefans posting a micro-review that brought out
the nature of ~Eunoia~ in a way I'd previously missed,
and as a result of Christopher W. Alexander bringing
out points about glossolalia that mentioned ~Cabinet.~

Already here, it shows, I'm more concerned
about/focussed on the on-List ~advertisements,~
whereas you're more irked by the absence of discussion
(the latest ~Fence~ takes uniquely unprecedented and
~admirable~ candor in presenting their distributors'
actual print-outs--- with sales figures!
Congratulations, Rebecca/Rebecca-informants while
Rebecca is on her doubtlessly tiring but envigorating
~Manderley~ road show.  The charts should be framed,
it's so good. --- Tragic, hopefully not, that their
optimism was fueled by the "irrational exuberance"
[Greenspan] of the now antediluvian lost "New
Economy," and that recession nihilism may well show
Fence's charts' upward curve to have been sub-sets of
a larger upward slope mania that's been broken by
three airplanes and thousands and thousands of deaths,
"jinxed").

Maybe that's because I see advertising as an
unstoppable semiotic that's really a major vehicle for
graphic artists, designers, actors, models,
epigrammatists, etc., and quite "avant-garde" in its
ingenuities.  And I'm mainly disappointed by how
anemically we pursue marketing and how uncreative and
ascii ads are, on-List.

[mar-/mar-]:

I don't think we're marginalized; I think we're bad at
marketing.

But thanks for your own statistical avant-gardisme,
--- the future is Neo-Pythagorean! --- which I read as
a Herron poetic artefact in and of itself.  Bar charts
would've been nice (Silliman did Armantrout pie charts
in ~A Wild Salience~).

Jeffrey

P.S. The "BICKERING" and fighting that you condone as
the spice of discussion also greatly contributes, I
suspect, to the drop-off in discussion: you have a
thicker hide for and propensity toward it than many.
Poets are sensitive plants, and people of substance
aren't going to risk their vulnerability where at any
moment their "lessers" are given full clearance to
pounce and lash out over imaginary slights.  (But I'm
debilitatingly conflict-avoidant {meek!}.)

Professional academics tend to participate less
seriously in on-List discussion, too.  Perhaps they
see it as "work," or their interlocutors as being
unqualified; they're more "careful," though.  On-List
participation sometimes parallels how long a
batch/klatsch enjoys ~grad student~ status together.
They clam up once they've gotten tenure-track
appointments.

P.P.S. I rented ~Being John Malkovich~ the other night
to see the Emily Dickinson puppet, and the puppeteer's
employer, Lester Inc., reminded me of your
coincidentally named marionette Lester.

I am interested in hearing from people who have favorite contemporary
poems that they teach that are not readily available. Like I teach Alice
Notley's "White Phosphorus" over and over. But the poem isn't really in
print.

I'm asking because I am working on a website that is dedicated to
discussing the teaching of contemporary poetry. I am trying to make what
could be seen as a small web anthology and/or list of poems (depends on
whether I can get permission to reprint or not) that are ideal for
teaching. The website's intended audience is secondary and
post-secondary teachers. I would like to draw attention to often
overlooked poems.

I am also interested in hearing if anyone has any poems that help them
to teach in new ways. Like any particular exercise they might use with a
certain poem. (Again, to return to "White Phosphorus," I use this poem
to demonstrate the multivoiced potential within poetry through an
exercise in performance.)

Appropriate credit will be given. Or if anyone wanted to write something
up, they could have authorship of a particular section.

Please back channel me (spahr@hawaii.edu) with any information. I get
lost on this list.

Thanks for your time.

>Your
on-List silence had been noticeable. I heard you hurt
your shin.  Condolences.

I shattered my ankle and had reconstructive surgery.  I do appreciate your
sympathies.  It's been a very difficult month.  That doesn't explain my
absence, however.

>And I was worried that maybe your silence meant you were cooking up some
sort of mischievous heteronym!  :)

Oh, no no; what you see from me (patrick@proximate.org) is all you will see
here on this list from me, or from any other list you may think of, for that
matter.  From my point of view, heteronymity makes for a poor political
device but a good literary device.  The overlap between politics and
literature is what makes it rich and more complicated than can be expressed
in a simple oppostitional diagram of literary vs. politics.

>Something seems muddled with your statistics for advertisements, though:
7.5 doesn't seem to correspond to 65,

Nothing's muddled with my numbers.  Maybe I should explain what they mean.
7.5 is a percentage.  7.5% of posts from November 1998 were promotional.
67% of posts in November 1998 were part of discussion threads.  65% of posts
from November 2001 were promotional, while only 29% of posts in November
2001 were part of threads.  Promotional email in November 1998 made up only
7.5% of email volume; last month it was fully 65% of list activity.  During
the same period, discussion dropped from 67% of the posts to 29%.  Hope that
helps.

I chose random samples (large) for measuring the percent of prmotional
e-mails.  Finding out what e-mails were promotional required that I read
each post.  You can imagine that reading (and clicking on) 1300+ e-mails,
one at a time, would be way too tedious.  Besides, from a statistical point
of view, it would likely be a waste of time. Every other value measured used
the entirety of data available.

>numerically, and you might've done better to stick it
out for an additional count of 62 (= 214 - 149),

Uh, I see what you mean.  Actually, 149 would have been fine on both
(actually 35 would have been more than sufficient for both), but the added
accuracy of the sample of the larger was something I wasn't going to throw
away or recount.  my arm hurt enough already!  and it provides no
significant deviation problems.  The differences in the numbers in
discussion and promotions are an order of magnitude!  If I carefully mapped
out chi-squared stuff it would not have made a difference.  I wouldn't
submit these results to a scientific journal (as someone might get a little
anal retentive and not see the forest from the trees) but they are strong
enough to make these general statements.

>neo-Pythagorean in their sense of "beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is
all you know on earth and all you need to know," and charming.

Are you going to say that numbers are simply no good, or part of some
antiquated way of thinking?  Some say facts are living turned inside out.
Sure sure, I've heard it before, but it's a cop-out.  "Charming?"  Like the
way a carriage-house is "charming"?  The way a child ties his shoes for the
first time?  I'd rather not be snide!  Let's instead be open and
forthcoming!  Or am I misconstruing your use of "charming"?  How wuould you
take it if I called your analysis "charming"?

>and I was more interested in
plotting ~who~ responds to ~whose~ posts and threads,

follow-the-leader.

I fnd this interesting, and it is perhaps an importantly related issue.
There are certainly issues of power at stake.  (See my coming response to
David Baratier.)  What say you on this?

>I've wondered if Christopher W. Alexander or Prof.
Bernstein couldn't somehow "cordon off" or segregate
ads from poetics discussion.  . . . I do strongly agree

somehow.

Yeah, this seems to be a good idea to me.  This seems to be a moderation
function, one that could be self-moderated.  I've been on plenty of lists
where are are really two lists, one for announcements, and the other for dis
cussion.  It seems to work.  Now, of course, the line between promotion and
discussion is certainly not black and white, but most of the time it's
pretty blatant.

>There's something terribly ~American~ in this

Haven't enough Americans been singled out (and murdered) for their
mercantilism?  My problem isn't nationalistic or economic--mine is with the
function of the list itself.

I see what you mean, that perhaps people of other flags are not so tacky.
Perhaps, but I am always way of the prejudices of supposed "taste" from
those of the Queen's Domain and from that bastion of history (ahem)--Europe.
I see the British as no better authority on taste, despite the contrary
indications.  "Candle in the Wind?"  Ugh.  Vomit.  Tacky people come from
every nation.  And every nation has years and years of history.  I believe
Europeans did a good job of rather systematically erasing the histories of
North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East,
perhaps so that they would be better-positioned on the "we were first"
scale.  (I mean this not as a belligerent point but as a humorous one, one
that should have my friends on the other side of either pond nodding "yes,
yes.")  I mean, yes, we Americans are tacky, but so too is everyone else.
It cannot be avoided!  erasing other cultures for the sake of manufacturing
an illusion of one's own cultural primacy does not reduce the level of
tackiness.  It seems to have an effect to the contrary.  Besides, one of my
favorite places on earth is Canal Street--it's SO tacky!


>But it isn't only the alienation that poets are

because it is a gesture of authority.

Oh I agree with what you imply here, but I think I've heard theories about
proximity from others.  From a literary perspective I find obsessive
Nominalism exclusionary, alienating, and boring.

bucks off this, are ya?  Are you promoting merchandise or free ideas?  I'd
say the latter.

More on this?



>The "BICKERING" and fighting that you condone as
the spice of discussion

Let me explain: I DO tolerate arguments (discussions with difference of
opinion) because they are a mark of emotional investment.  Detatchment is so
boring, and seems so fake, and it is a gesture signifying nothing but some
sort of god-like stature.

On a list I created, a member is allowed to say what he or she wants.  If a
person gets really ad hominem, the post will of course through, but the
person's account is temporarily removed from list activity for a few days,
just so as that person can go and simmer down.  Fighting in the form of
name-calling, threats, etc., is intolerable.  Debate, especially lively
debate where people do seem vested in their positions, is a pretty common
feature of human discussion and IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.
I don't like people calling other people names, but I don't see why people
have to FREAK OUT (either by fighting or by insults or condescentions or
other provocations) when a difference of opinion is voiced.  that I see as a
mark of a closed community, a dying community, a community that can be
revitalized through an awareness of the failures that closed-mindedness
breeds.   Nevertheless, I wasn't born yesterday, so I know the risk of
freedom is that someone will be offended.  I think the risk is worth it.
Let David Duke come to my town to speak.  And I should be allowed to tell
him and his attendees that these ideas of him are bad, unproductive,
ignorant, etc.

>Poets are sensitive plants, and people of substance
aren't going to risk their vulnerability where at any
moment their "lessers" are given full clearance to
pounce and lash out over imaginary slights.

But what about Hugh MacDiarmid's rule - one has to be thin-skinned to be a
writer and thick-skinned to deal with the consequences?  Doesn't that carry
over here?  I agree with you.

>On-List participation sometimes parallels how long a

appointments.

Well, that's sad, isn't it?  Should poets act like slaves?  Isn't that
dangerous to poetry?  Once upon a time poets could either deal with being
poor or keep their day jobs.  Now it's about tenure?  I'm reluctant to
scapegoat academia for this, as people are always more than their
professions.

it is time to face armageddon
prepare for your death
there is not enough time but there is no time for the will or contract
there is no one to leave to
there is no memory
nothing is of account and nothing will be accounted for
there is no emptiness in massive death
the world will return to substance
fires continue to burn beneath the world trade center
we do not recognize ourselves in ash yah yah
our skin already begins to fall
our breath is shorter
all we have left to do is recognize this fundamental truth
we are close to extinction
prepare for this
make peace
resign

I "butted in" to something Millie was saying about Merrill and his poem
"Cahanging Light At Sandhover" which I also found to long and (for me) too
obscure. But here is one of a series of poems I wrote some time ago, apropos
of nothing. I started writing a fictitious "converation" (maybe I was
thinking a bit of Berryman) between a cockroach and the editor of the New
York Times (which is a bit bizarre because I hardly ever read that mag these
days and have only been to Manhatten briefly: in fact it was my only visit
to anywhere  outside NZ apart from Fiji) >>


   Can you have heard somewhere of 'Archy & Mehitabel' ?  Series of books by
poet and newspaper columnist (for the New York Sun) Don Marquis purporting
to be the conversations of Archy, a great poet who was reincarnated as a
cockroach.  Archy left notes and observations which Marquis would find on
his typewriter, which Archy used by jumping from key to key (no uppercase,
of course, since he couldn't use the shift key).  They're sweet books.

Then why don't the people running it (as I support my Runaway Spoon Press)?
Why make the losers of the contest support it?

          Spencer Holst, 75, Writer and
          Teller of Fables, Dies

          By HARVEY SHAPIRO

            Spencer Holst, a writer of fables and a fixture of
            the downtown Manhattan avant-garde scene for
          30 years, died on Nov. 23 at St. Vincent's Hospital in
          Manhattan. He was 75.

          He had been suffering from emphysema and
          apparently died of a stroke, said George Quasha, a co-
          owner of Station Hill/Barrytown, Mr. Holst's
          publisher.

          Mr. Holst gained his reputation partly from his own
          readings of his stories. He was a big-eyed man and
          read the magical tales with an air of constant
          wonderment, as if they had been dropped on his
          doorstep just that morning. They were short and often
          funny stories in which animals mixed with people.

          The poet Hugh Seidman, Mr. Holst's neighbor for 30
          years in Westbeth, the housing complex for artists in
          the West Village, said, "Once you heard him perform
          his classic tales, like `The Frog' or `A Balkan
          Entertainment,' it was impossible to get his voice out
          of your head, impossible not to hear it each time you
          read one of his fables."

          His venues for readings included Westbeth, the
          former club Max's Kansas City, Judson Memorial
          Church and the Village Vanguard.

          His books of stories included "On Demons" (written
          with his wife, the painter Beate Wheeler), "The
          Language of Cats and Other Stories," "Prose for
          Dancing," "The Zebra Storyteller," "Brilliant Silence,"
          and "Spencer Holst Stories," for which he received the
          Hilda and Richard Rosenthal Foundation Award from
          the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
          Letters in 1977.

          His stories are hard to classify. The poet John
          Hollander said: "These are routines — something like
          fictions, something like jokes — of a stand-up tragic.
          Transcriptions of a spoken voice, their cadences linger
          beyond laughter."

          In one of his characteristic stories, "The Frog," a frog
          becomes "addicted to morphine during experiments at
          the federal hospital at Lexington, Ky.," is eventually
          kissed by a beautiful teenager and, of course, becomes
          a prince ("a tall Italian-looking guy"). But the girl
          won't marry her prince because he is a drug addict;
          the narrator wins her.

          Some of his short stories are very short indeed. For
          example, "Mona Lisa Meets Buddha" reads in its
          entirety: "Up in heaven the curtains fluttered, the
          curtains fluttered, and the Mona Lisa entered at one
          end of a small hall, which was hung with many veils.
          Up in heaven the curtains fluttered, fluttered,
          fluttered, and the Buddha entered the hall at the
          other end. They smiled."

          He once said of himself, "In the geography of
          literature I have always felt my work to be
          equidistant between two writers, each born in Ohio —
          Hart Crane and James Thurber — but my wife says
          don't be silly, your stories are halfway between Hans
          Christian Andersen and Franz Kafka."

          Mr. Holst was born in 1926 in Detroit and grew up in
          Ohio, where his father was a sports columnist for The
          Toledo Blade and The Toledo Times. In 1957 he came
          to New York determined to be a writer. He married
          Ms. Wheeler, and in 1970 they became charter
          tenants of Westbeth. He lived there until his death.

          In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister,
          Mary-Ella Holst, of Manhattan; a son, Sebastian, of
          Chevy Chase, Md.; and two grandchildren.

someone he knew and so on (it was a toss up between him and O'Hara both

Absolutely right.  Deserving people win prizes all the time.  The way I heard
the Ashbery Yale Younger Poets Series story is that both Ashbery and O'Hara
were sacked before their manuscripts reached Auden.  Once Auden decided that
none of the finalists presented to him merited the award, someone informed
him that Ashbery and O'Hara had entered but had been weeded out at a lower
level.  Auden then asked to see the manuscripts and ultimately chose Ashbery.
 How much of this is true I have no way of knowing.  And I agree that both A
& O are great poets.  Best, Bill

I find the advertisements for readings to be very helpful.  They list many
events not on the NYC Poetry Calendar.  This things on the calendar seem to
be mostly open readings, many of the "slam" variety in which a poem has to
pack a punch and keep the audience entertained/laughing/indignant at some
societal injustice.

You get absolutely nowhere reading (rather than performing) a Language poem
there:  Most language poems are interesting for the interactions between the
lines or stanzas, where each piece of a poem is seen as a sort of
independent entity which bounces off the other pieces of the poem and
creates linkages between the ideas.  But the individaul pieces of the
language poem are not of the sort needed to keep people laughing; often they
are everyday things, like in Silliman's alpahbet project or
surreal-but-not-funny as in Leslie Scalapino's work or Clark Coolodge's (not
sure if he counts as a language poet, though).

Likewise, a formalist poem also gets no encouragement at these poetry
slams-- formalist poems are too boring for such a setting, and they often
depend on a lot of literary allusions and depend on the reader's knowledge
of the history of poetry.  This is a problem at slams.  I recently got up
and read a surreal poem about Agamemnon, and I felt it necessary to tell who
A. was and how his bitchy wife Clytemnestra bumped him off when he got back
from the war, because by then she had found another guy and didn't want her
husband putting an end to her affair (you can see the tone I felt forced to
adopt...)  you can't depend on a slam audience knowing anything, except the
work of the regulars at the slam...

It is my opinion that slams generate a kind of poetry which is fun to listen
to but which seems very shallow if you read the poems.  I don't have
anything against slam poetry.  It's usually more "fun" to listen to the slam
poems than to listen to poems at a nonslam venue's open readings.  And often
even very good poetry is too hard to appreciate when it is unfamiliar and
you only hear it.  To understand a poem, you have to remember all the
previous lines in the poem, to see how the poem builds meaning or to catch
refernces between the various sections.  Moreover, people actually come to
slam events, which makes you feel good about the state of poetry.  But I
have noticed that trying to please the slam people has been bad for my work.
So I have stopped going to these events.  Unfortunately, I also don't go
often to the readings I see advertised here by poets whose work I admire.
But I'd never even know about these readings without the list.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for your lovely, Bourdievian numbers.  (Your
on-List silence had been noticeable. I heard you hurt
your shin.  Condolences.  And I was worried that maybe
your silence meant you were cooking up some sort of
mischievous heteronym!  :)  I'm relieved to see you're
putting your time to good use.)  Something seems
muddled with your statistics for advertisements,
though: 7.5 doesn't seem to correspond to 65,
numerically, and you might've done better to stick it
out for an additional count of 62 (= 214 - 149), I
think, especially with randomness, as comparison
between samples of unequal size involve chi-factors or
r or something . . . but otherwise, I find these
numbers neo-Pythagorean in their sense of "beauty is
truth, truth beauty, that is all you know on earth and
all you need to know," and charming.

I felt tempted to do the same myself --- but upping
nutritional supplements of Vitamin Shoppe 1500 MG
Amino Complex to 10 tabs a day seems to have moderated
my counting mania --- and I was more interested in
plotting ~who~ responds to ~whose~ posts and threads,
for more of an analysis of power and
follow-the-leader.

I also find the number of advertisements distressing.
It's like being on one of those servers with pop-up
ads that keep cluttering the screen.  One waste of
time there, for me, is that poetry-dvertisers do not
as a rule mark their subject header with their
location,--- so I waste clicks opening ads for
interesting poets' readings that are then
disappointingly unreachable in far-away States I can't
attend (given the impounding of my private jet), not
that I ever leave the house anyway.  So, (#1) I think
it wld. at least be thoughtful of advertisers to mark
location in subject header, . . . although I can
understand that reputation accumulates through the
redundancy of name, and why anyone wld. be motivated
just to infiltrate Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein
Gertrude Stein at every loophole, "fame"-building.

I've wondered if Christopher W. Alexander or Prof.
Bernstein couldn't somehow "cordon off" or segregate
ads from poetics discussion.  In print, ads are
generally separated to the margins and not
interspersed with "articles."  --- Pedagogically,
insofar as the List is State U. educational outreach,
it's like mixing in Save Fifty Cents coupons with
class notes. --- Electronically, segregation might be
effort, though (develop a co-site/cache), . . . but
maybe not all that much effort: even free servers like
Yahoo provide instantaneous group resources that
poetry-advertisers cld. be given a one-time "warning"
to post to, for those interested to consult, and then
otherwise summarily blocked/deleted (as exploitative,
mercenary, whatever).  I've even considered as public
"penance" taking it upon myself to maintain an on-line
Poetry Calendar such items could be re-directed to and
plotted more helpfully, systematically, the way Sharon
Matling (name?) single-handedly started the NYC Poetry
Calendar as a 2-sided broadsheet that became a
company.

I do strongly agree that it wld. improve readering for
ads to be segregated somehow.


There's something terribly ~American~ in this
anti-social Buy This/Go There panhandling that's done
on-List, by poets (communicators!) who have total
impunity abt. addressing a community only to try to
change peers into audience.  Very lively, daily
discussion (although abt. work of a different "taste"
than the Buff' List's) goes on at PoetryEtc, for
example, which is predominately UK and AU/NZ sign-ons,
who don't seem as thoroughly ~permeated by
mercantilism~ as Americans.

I'm very easily manipulated by advertisements (which
is why I don't watch television or go to the movies,
and have trouble with newspapers and magazines), ---
psychology finds that some types are objectively more
"hypnotizable" by ads/promos! --- and it's distressing
to find my relation to poetry being bent into docile
consumerism: I spend, easily, between a hundred and
two hundred a month on poetry, average, much of it via
SPD or checks to on-List book/journal advertisers.
That's okay but, once upon a time, my naive attachment
to poetry was because an endlessly re-readable enigma
masterpiece and nothing but paper and pen/typewriter
was a ~refuge~ from consumerism.

But it isn't only the alienation that poets are
dousing colleagues with here that bothers me (I find
it tacky if the automatic footer at the bottom of a
poet's discussion post leads to a book of theirs and a
price for where to send for it, too): it's the lack of
~creativity,~ or imagination, or even--- guile! in how
matter-of-factly and mass media-like they style their
"Satisfy Me" commands.  Utopian, I think it's holding
back a potential new ~poetry~ of inventive free market
gamesmanship, a "litvertizing," as it were, where
poetry would grown into being ironically/ambiguously
conjoined with the zeitgeist of
advertisement-seduction.  What were all those names of
friends doing in New York School poetry, if not a
collective stategy of shared advertising and
name-redundancy?  (How ~could~ Bill Berkson be
advertised on-List this week if, in the golden age of
genuine inspired "litvertizing," Frank O'Hara hadn't
paved a reptutation for him by dint of including his
name in O'Hara immortality?) Forgive me if it seems
vain of me to use myself as an example, but it took
much more than an hour to put together and post my
shoddy little

http://www.geocities.com/jeffreyjullich/EUNOIAN.LITTLE.LEXICON.htm
,

with no self-interest in Bok's reputation other than I
genuinely find him to be among the two or three most
remarkable.  It was advertising, though, disinterested
advertising, labor-intensive advertising. And I was
lead to doing that, and to ordering Bok's book and to
hearing him on the ~Cabinet~ CD as a result of Brian
Kim Stefans posting a micro-review that brought out
the nature of ~Eunoia~ in a way I'd previously missed,
and as a result of Christopher W. Alexander bringing
out points about glossolalia that mentioned ~Cabinet.~

Already here, it shows, I'm more concerned
about/focussed on the on-List ~advertisements,~
whereas you're more irked by the absence of discussion
(the latest ~Fence~ takes uniquely unprecedented and
~admirable~ candor in presenting their distributors'
actual print-outs--- with sales figures!
Congratulations, Rebecca/Rebecca-informants while
Rebecca is on her doubtlessly tiring but envigorating
~Manderley~ road show.  The charts should be framed,
it's so good. --- Tragic, hopefully not, that their
optimism was fueled by the "irrational exuberance"
[Greenspan] of the now antediluvian lost "New
Economy," and that recession nihilism may well show
Fence's charts' upward curve to have been sub-sets of
a larger upward slope mania that's been broken by
three airplanes and thousands and thousands of deaths,
"jinxed").

Maybe that's because I see advertising as an
unstoppable semiotic that's really a major vehicle for
graphic artists, designers, actors, models,
epigrammatists, etc., and quite "avant-garde" in its
ingenuities.  And I'm mainly disappointed by how
anemically we pursue marketing and how uncreative and
ascii ads are, on-List.

[mar-/mar-]:

I don't think we're marginalized; I think we're bad at
marketing.

But thanks for your own statistical avant-gardisme,
--- the future is Neo-Pythagorean! --- which I read as
a Herron poetic artefact in and of itself.  Bar charts
would've been nice (Silliman did Armantrout pie charts
in ~A Wild Salience~).

P.S. The "BICKERING" and fighting that you condone as
the spice of discussion also greatly contributes, I
suspect, to the drop-off in discussion: you have a
thicker hide for and propensity toward it than many.
Poets are sensitive plants, and people of substance
aren't going to risk their vulnerability where at any
moment their "lessers" are given full clearance to
pounce and lash out over imaginary slights.  (But I'm
debilitatingly conflict-avoidant {meek!}.)

Professional academics tend to participate less
seriously in on-List discussion, too.  Perhaps they
see it as "work," or their interlocutors as being
unqualified; they're more "careful," though.  On-List
participation sometimes parallels how long a
batch/klatsch enjoys ~grad student~ status together.
They clam up once they've gotten tenure-track
appointments.

P.P.S. I rented ~Being John Malkovich~ the other night
to see the Emily Dickinson puppet, and the puppeteer's
employer, Lester Inc., reminded me of your
coincidentally named marionette Lester.

Maybe, Jeffrey, I'm just being ridiculous!  Maybe I'm best served instead
with a little wisdom.  Things are as they are.  Poetry is not in danger, and
neither is the ability or willingness of poets to speak freely with one
another.  There are always open folks in every outfit, camp, and circle,
left, right, ivory, corporate, homeless, landed.  I must always continue to
seek out such company.  I can't just go running around asking everyone else
to be like such-and-such.  Silly silly emotional little me.

Best,
P

>Your
on-List silence had been noticeable. I heard you hurt
your shin.  Condolences.

I shattered my ankle and had reconstructive surgery.  I do appreciate your
sympathies.  It's been a very difficult month.  That doesn't explain my
absence, however.

>And I was worried that maybe your silence meant you were cooking up some
sort of mischievous heteronym!  :)

Oh, no no; what you see from me (patrick@proximate.org) is all you will see
here on this list from me, or from any other list you may think of, for that
matter.  From my point of view, heteronymity makes for a poor political
device but a good literary device.  The overlap between politics and
literature is what makes it rich and more complicated than can be expressed
in a simple oppostitional diagram of literary vs. politics.

>Something seems muddled with your statistics for advertisements, though:
7.5 doesn't seem to correspond to 65,

Nothing's muddled with my numbers.  Maybe I should explain what they mean.
7.5 is a percentage.  7.5% of posts from November 1998 were promotional.
67% of posts in November 1998 were part of discussion threads.  65% of posts
from November 2001 were promotional, while only 29% of posts in November
2001 were part of threads.  Promotional email in November 1998 made up only
7.5% of email volume; last month it was fully 65% of list activity.  During
the same period, discussion dropped from 67% of the posts to 29%.  Hope that
helps.

I chose random samples (large) for measuring the percent of prmotional
e-mails.  Finding out what e-mails were promotional required that I read
each post.  You can imagine that reading (and clicking on) 1300+ e-mails,
one at a time, would be way too tedious.  Besides, from a statistical point
of view, it would likely be a waste of time. Every other value measured used
the entirety of data available.

>numerically, and you might've done better to stick it
out for an additional count of 62 (= 214 - 149),

Uh, I see what you mean.  Actually, 149 would have been fine on both
(actually 35 would have been more than sufficient for both), but the added
accuracy of the sample of the larger was something I wasn't going to throw
away or recount.  my arm hurt enough already!  and it provides no
significant deviation problems.  The differences in the numbers in
discussion and promotions are an order of magnitude!  If I carefully mapped
out chi-squared stuff it would not have made a difference.  I wouldn't
submit these results to a scientific journal (as someone might get a little
anal retentive and not see the forest from the trees) but they are strong
enough to make these general statements.

>neo-Pythagorean in their sense of "beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is
all you know on earth and all you need to know," and charming.

Are you going to say that numbers are simply no good, or part of some
antiquated way of thinking?  Some say facts are living turned inside out.
Sure sure, I've heard it before, but it's a cop-out.  "Charming?"  Like the
way a carriage-house is "charming"?  The way a child ties his shoes for the
first time?  I'd rather not be snide!  Let's instead be open and
forthcoming!  Or am I misconstruing your use of "charming"?  How wuould you
take it if I called your analysis "charming"?

>and I was more interested in
plotting ~who~ responds to ~whose~ posts and threads,
for more of an analysis of power and
follow-the-leader.

I fnd this interesting, and it is perhaps an importantly related issue.
There are certainly issues of power at stake.  (See my coming response to
David Baratier.)  What say you on this?

>I've wondered if Christopher W. Alexander or Prof.
Bernstein couldn't somehow "cordon off" or segregate
ads from poetics discussion.  . . . I do strongly agree
that it wld. improve readering for ads to be segregated
somehow.

Yeah, this seems to be a good idea to me.  This seems to be a moderation
function, one that could be self-moderated.  I've been on plenty of lists
where are are really two lists, one for announcements, and the other for dis
cussion.  It seems to work.  Now, of course, the line between promotion and
discussion is certainly not black and white, but most of the time it's
pretty blatant.

>There's something terribly ~American~ in this
anti-social Buy This/Go There panhandling that's done
on-List, by poets (communicators!) who have total
impunity abt. addressing a community only to try to
change peers into audience.  Very lively, daily
discussion (although abt. work of a different "taste"
than the Buff' List's) goes on at PoetryEtc, for
example, which is predominately UK and AU/NZ sign-ons,
who don't seem as thoroughly ~permeated by
mercantilism~ as Americans.

Haven't enough Americans been singled out (and murdered) for their
mercantilism?  My problem isn't nationalistic or economic--mine is with the
function of the list itself.

I see what you mean, that perhaps people of other flags are not so tacky.
Perhaps, but I am always way of the prejudices of supposed "taste" from
those of the Queen's Domain and from that bastion of history (ahem)--Europe.
I see the British as no better authority on taste, despite the contrary
indications.  "Candle in the Wind?"  Ugh.  Vomit.  Tacky people come from
every nation.  And every nation has years and years of history.  I believe
Europeans did a good job of rather systematically erasing the histories of
North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East,
perhaps so that they would be better-positioned on the "we were first"
scale.  (I mean this not as a belligerent point but as a humorous one, one
that should have my friends on the other side of either pond nodding "yes,
yes.")  I mean, yes, we Americans are tacky, but so too is everyone else.
It cannot be avoided!  erasing other cultures for the sake of manufacturing
an illusion of one's own cultural primacy does not reduce the level of
tackiness.  It seems to have an effect to the contrary.  Besides, one of my
favorite places on earth is Canal Street--it's SO tacky!


>But it isn't only the alienation that poets are
dousing colleagues with here that bothers me (I find
it tacky if the automatic footer at the bottom of a
poet's discussion post leads to a book of theirs and a
price for where to send for it, too): it's the lack of
~creativity,~ or imagination, or even--- guile! in how
matter-of-factly and mass media-like they style their
"Satisfy Me" commands.

Ohm yes yes I do agree.  I dislike it, though, not because it's tacky but
because it is a gesture of authority.

>What were all those names of
friends doing in New York School poetry, if not a
collective stategy of shared advertising and
name-redundancy?

Oh I agree with what you imply here, but I think I've heard theories about
proximity from others.  From a literary perspective I find obsessive
Nominalism exclusionary, alienating, and boring.

with no self-interest in Bok's reputation other than I
genuinely find him to be among the two or three most
remarkable.

I loved this.  yeah it's kinda promotional, but at the same time you were
saying, I LOVED THIS.  This is a gray area thing.  But you're not making any
bucks off this, are ya?  Are you promoting merchandise or free ideas?  I'd
say the latter.

More on this?



>The "BICKERING" and fighting that you condone as
the spice of discussion

Let me explain: I DO tolerate arguments (discussions with difference of
opinion) because they are a mark of emotional investment.  Detatchment is so
boring, and seems so fake, and it is a gesture signifying nothing but some
sort of god-like stature.

On a list I created, a member is allowed to say what he or she wants.  If a
person gets really ad hominem, the post will of course through, but the
person's account is temporarily removed from list activity for a few days,
just so as that person can go and simmer down.  Fighting in the form of
name-calling, threats, etc., is intolerable.  Debate, especially lively
debate where people do seem vested in their positions, is a pretty common
feature of human discussion and IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.
I don't like people calling other people names, but I don't see why people
have to FREAK OUT (either by fighting or by insults or condescentions or
other provocations) when a difference of opinion is voiced.  that I see as a
mark of a closed community, a dying community, a community that can be
revitalized through an awareness of the failures that closed-mindedness
breeds.   Nevertheless, I wasn't born yesterday, so I know the risk of
freedom is that someone will be offended.  I think the risk is worth it.
Let David Duke come to my town to speak.  And I should be allowed to tell
him and his attendees that these ideas of him are bad, unproductive,
ignorant, etc.

>Poets are sensitive plants, and people of substance
aren't going to risk their vulnerability where at any
moment their "lessers" are given full clearance to
pounce and lash out over imaginary slights.

But what about Hugh MacDiarmid's rule - one has to be thin-skinned to be a
writer and thick-skinned to deal with the consequences?  Doesn't that carry
over here?  I agree with you.

>On-List participation sometimes parallels how long a
batch/klatsch enjoys ~grad student~ status together.
They clam up once they've gotten tenure-track
appointments.

Well, that's sad, isn't it?  Should poets act like slaves?  Isn't that
dangerous to poetry?  Once upon a time poets could either deal with being
poor or keep their day jobs.  Now it's about tenure?  I'm reluctant to
scapegoat academia for this, as people are always more than their
professions.

          As all things sigh toward their nigh,
          The Cockroach, who was really a naughty=20
           grubby little genius, rolled off
           his back and spoke insistently to Ed:
           "Editor - Word Man - you know ahat?"
           "What?" The Editor knew Cock from way back:
           "Shakespere's a bad poet: full of his own cliches
           and all that stuff about sans this sans that and=20
           kingdoms for horses and food is the music of all thought:
           it's only clickketety click click click clack clack
           that matters these latter days in this vertical city
           of  8 million souls..."  =20

           The Editor turned laconically to the window
           and the deep truths of the ever busy
           and exhaustively yellow street leapt to his gaze.
           Yes, Roach had a point, after all: `a man is man
           and a woman is a woman', he mused: and if he was to
           run for Mayor he'd have to shake hands=20
           with fuck knows how many plasmic trolls.
           The gulf was uncrossable - all that spittle.
           He turned back to Roach, passing a cigar.
           They smoked in silence. Ensuing. Roach
           was the first to unnumb the ice:
           "We haven'y got a cracker's squeak -
            you know what I did? - I walked Times Square all night -
           and no Joe took any notice - fuck me, and me
           me as big as a goddam skyscraper!!"
           The Editor nodded, and openned his hands:
           "You know Roach, our Love surpasses
            the greatest neon allegory."  =20

ST. MARK'S POETRY PROJECT FRIDAY PRESENTS

understood the quintessence of "being" that signifies the thinker in many
societies as "artist."

If you had any idea how underfunded San Francisco State University is, there
would be no question as to why the Poetry Center has to charge a reading
fee. Yes, it is annoying (and perhaps prohibitive) that poets have to pay a
reading fee, but it's amazing the work that the Poetry Center has done over
the years on a shoestring. And the contest is in no way "brand name." Take a
look at the past winners.

Wild Honey Press is pleased to announce the publication of _Mnemosyne_ by
Alison Croggon.

14x18 cm, 16 pages, 250 gsm "Natural" Strata card cover with colour
illustration, hand sewn with green twist.

The cover illustration is a detail from Jim Andrews' _Garbogawd_ (the
original can be see at http://www.vispo.com).
Anyone who knows Jim's work will know to expect a stunner.

Alison Croggon is an Australian poet, born in 1962. Her books include the
collection _The Blue Gate_and the novel _Navigatio_. She has written  the
libretto for the operas _The Burrow_ and _Gauguin_and is currently  working
on _The White Army. _ Her plays include _The Famine _ and _Samarkand._ She
is a founding editor of _Masthead_ literary magazine.

I know there have been complaints on the list re publishers' hype so I'll
try to restrain myself. The text could be described as a sequence of
meditations on birth. Grounded in experience, memory and intelligence I
found it impossible to resist. I was a member of the Irish Home Birth
Association for years, and, as it happened, delivered my fourth daughter
Beatrice (light work indeed as mother, Louise, and baby do it all) and it
spoke volumes to me. Apart from purely poetical considerations, I
particularly responded to how _natural_ birth is in this poem. No theatrics,
drum beating or eye-in-the-sky pseudo objectivity.

It's $5 / STG3.50.  (p&p free) You can order online at
http://www.wildhoneypress.com/BOOKS/Mnemosyne.html

or just visit to enjoy the cover and some extracts, including the following,
appended below.:

BTW if you're  broke and would still like a copy, bc me and we'll organise
something.

SUZANNE WISE is the author of the poetry collection The Kingdom of the
Subjunctive (Alice James Books, 2000). Her writing also appears in American
Poetry: The Next Generation (Carnegie Mellon, 2000). "I love Suzanne Wise's
poems because they're droll and cavalier, magnificent and terrified all at
once. With all the invisible poise of Masculinity-which she doesn't care to
possess-she manages to flip responsibility governing her poems so that
what's secretly driving them feels like everyone's problem. And that seems
like a grand success. As if a vast and almost patriotic distress signal were
being sent out." -Eileen Myles

REBECCA WEE's poems have been published in The Iowa Review, Ploughshares,
The Senora Review, The Mid-American Review, and others. She received her MFA
in poetry in 1992 from George Mason University and worked as an editorial
assistant to poet Carolyn Forche on her 1993 Norton anthology, Against
Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness. Her first book, Uncertain
Grace, published in May 2001 by Copper Canyon Press, won the 2000 Hayden
Carruth Award for New and Emerging Poets. She teaches creative writing at
Augustana College in Rock Island, IL. [8:00 pm]

This book is not to be confused with the one on the Clinton Administration
or the recent book of fiction (I guess) by Sue Margolis....

"A unique and extremely valuable work of criticism. It is the first work I know
to recognize the gulf between established contemporaries, about whom many of us
write, and other,
usually younger writers, who have much greater claims to be capturing what
might count
as 'contemporaneity.'...Stroffolino has the hearing to pick up these signals
and the eloquence to celebrate the differences they make."---Charles Altieri

"With pomp and punk, Stroffolino here unleashes his sensibility, acumen, and
passionate appreciation onto the variegated lawn of (mostly) contemporary
poetry. His code-mingling, quasi-Boolean rhetoric (whose rhythmic sweep I
experience as a WILD RIDE c.f. Mercutio's "soliloquies") generates unexpected
propositions that newly illuminate the objects of his maverick
attention."--(Nada) Gordon

Hello Everyone:

We are happy to announce some wonderful developments. We have finished th=
e
poetry curriculum which lists the poems that will be read on the mountain=
s
around the world. The poems selected for the Poetry on the Peaks curricul=
um
focus on humanity and its relationship with nature and with each other.
 It features a wide range of poets like So Chong Ju, Gary Snyder, William=

Blake, Oodgeroo Noonucal, Alfonsina Storni, Leopold S=E9dhar Senghor and =
many
others. We have mixed the selection so that Wislawa Szymborska's poem wil=
l
be read on Mt. Bonnell and Mevlana Jeladuddin Rumi's poem will be read on=

Mt. Kilimanjaro and so on.  Our objectives is to create cross-cultural di=
alogue
and understanding, so the poems were selected so that they would be read
on a mountain not associated with the poet's nationality.  A free ebook
anthology edited by William Pitt Root will be available in the summer of
2002 listing all of the poems read on the mountains.

Also, Michael Willoughby with Magnetcom and Mark L. Hall with Ego-East wi=
ll
be helping us with publicity.

Lastly, we will be setting up special readings around the world to focus
on Poetry on the Peaks and increase awareness for each individual reading=
.
 For example, in July 2002 there will be a reading at Hugo House in Seatt=
le
for the Mt. Rainer climb; a reading at Ebenezer Baptist Church (spiritual=

home of Martin Luther King Jr.) in Atlanta and a reading at the New Schoo=
l,
New York City for World Poetry Day.  A press conference is being schedule=
d
at the National Arts Cub for the end of February, 2002.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 212-723-4125 or by email
at devineni@dialoguepoetry.org
More information on Poetry on the Peaks can be found at http://www.dialog=
uepoetry.org/mountain.htm
and the curriculum is available as a PDF file at http://www.dialoguepoetr=
y.org/mountain_ebook.htm

I have been thinking of your comments on the academic poetry - I am not too
sure poetry exists outside of the academy. Most of the people who run the
programs around here have some air of authority as they have been trained in
it. Even a high school teacher who wrote dreadful muck held her head up high
as being in the know. Society doesn't really need poems. I went to the
walmart yesterday and every person there wouldn't look at a poem as anything
other than something to worship and not enjoy. The Golden book of 100 poem
treasuries were on sale in the bargain book bin. This was a crowd of
america, the ones who Pound fled to Europe to escape. These people are who
we write for, are they not? This is all of us, only they look natural in
checkered flannel and grizzly beards. Everyone who I ran across was very
nice and in a holiday cheer. The people who are moved by poems seem to drift
towards the university as it is by law that they teach literature. Not like
basket weaving which is a free elective. The state requires us to be exposed
to poems So the ranking within schools programs which the stage for the
celebrity of Bernstein, Perloff and Sillyman. Not a bad place to be as they
have done exceptional work which can be recognized. But this only fuels the
flames as each person knows what a poem is and that gap of common
understanding is a big problem. We expect current poets to know something
about the art and the theory as to why it works. This deals with your light
hearted holing up on the writing list - its free flowing because we each see
the poem as something different and find our own ends with it. We all have
read "our" poet heroes and come from it acting in a know. Most are in a
university program so to find some way to keep the flame of desire burning
while doing something that has social value. Unfortunately its not pop
music. No one expects Brittany Spears to know why her rhythms works on to
the audience it does or the social implications of her body movements. Etc.
But since it is alive and in the public eye most accept it or not and can
explain why - which is done at walmart.
        what would happen to poetry if the universities gave it up? I am hopeful
that the people would stand up and organize; but they would more likely
contribute to a museum to tame it or maybe a even a black coffin.


        Best, Geoffrey

ATTENZIONE!

EXPERIMENTAL MOOD-ALTERING INTERVIEW REACHES MARKET

NEW YORK, Dec. 5 2001. (AP)

The "Two Kims" announce their latest invention: a low-orbiting digital
way-station for disconsolate malchicks and ruby-toed cowgirls.

Begun as a small project for the How2 website
(www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/), a journal of feminist
poetics, the interview took on a life of its own as the twin forces of LOVE
(amore) and INSURRECTION (pensare) mingled to elaborate an entire
alternative metaphysics for viewing the web.

Part portal, part interview, part settings of Rosenfield's sequence
"Verbali," part curry video-kabob but 100% pure poem, "The Truth Interview"
will make you never read "cyberpoetry" (and certainly not "hypertext"
poetry) the same way again.  It will convince you that wisdom comes in
small, well-aerated aromatic packages with peel-off labels.

The poet/therapist Kim Rosenfield and the poet/web artist Brian Kim Stefans
are now live.  And so is "The Truth Interview."

On Kim Rosenfield's Poetry

Kim Rosenfield's long-awaited Good Morning Midnight is a rollicking expose
of twenty-first century custom, superstition, procedure . . . in what's
known as fashion or culture or any such "industry." This monument is an
archeologically detailed excavation of logic's museum-quality levity.
Rosenfield's swift new evidence of the desperateness of all belief systems
except the most glossy, manages to mock sociology and ritual in the same
well-placed, tender, haute couture blow. You'll find timeless scientific
proverbs, sing-a-long singsongs, practical lists, style pointers,
drastically accurate translations, perfect solutions of all necessarily
fleeting sorts, 3-D reveries, and more, in living, better than Walt Disney
Sensurround. An olfactory must for all time capsules and poetry shoppers
alike.
        --Stacy Doris, Paramour

On The Truth Interview

This is not a site... The "Truth Interview" is a metasite, but not one more
site about websites.  It's something in between the voice and the text, the
author and the reader, poetry and advertisement.  It talks about creation
and it is made of creation.  The symbiosis between Kim Rosenfeld, the poet
and the website "voice", and Brian Stefans, the e-poet, who played here the
role of Editor and Interface Designer, is amazing. Some poems seem to have
been conceived for "the truth inteview" structure and the interface, seem to
be have been designed "on demand".  We will  never know...  But who cares?
This is not a site. It's e-reading.  So, pipe and play.
        -- Giselle Beiguelman, "The Book after the Book" (www.desvirtual.com)

I can't think of two people I'd rather go through the looking-glass with
than Brian Kim Stefans and Kim Rosenfield. Long on content and even longer
on style, 'The Truth' is a vast improvement over most interviews because
both parties know from the outset that it's not so much about where you're
going as how good you look along the way.
        -- Darren Wershler-Henry, the tapeworm foundry and alienated.net

A Just Cause, Not a Just War
Howard Zinn

I believe two moral judgments can be made about the present "war": The September 11 attack constitutes a crime against humanity and cannot be justified, and the bombing of Afghanistan is also a crime, which cannot be justified.

And yet, voices across the political spectrum, including many on the left, have described this as a "just war." One longtime advocate of peace, Richard Falk, wrote in The Nation that this is "the first truly just war since World War II." Robert Kuttner, another consistent supporter of social justice, declared in The American Prospect that only people on the extreme left could believe this is not a just war.

I have puzzled over this. How can a war be truly just when it involves the daily killing of civilians, when it causes hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to leave their homes to escape the bombs, when it may not find those who planned the September 11 attacks, and when it will multiply the ranks of people who are angry enough at this country to become terrorists themselves?

This war amounts to a gross violation of human rights, and it will produce the exact opposite of what is wanted: It will not end terrorism; it will proliferate terrorism.

I believe that the progressive supporters of the war have confused a "just cause" with a "just war."

There are unjust causes, such as the attempt of the United States to establish its power in Vietnam, or to dominate Panama or Grenada, or to subvert the government of Nicaragua. And a cause may be just--getting North Korea to withdraw from South Korea, getting Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, or ending terrorism--but it does not follow that going to war on behalf of that cause, with the inevitable mayhem that follows, is just.

The stories of the effects of our bombing are beginning to come through, in bits and pieces. Just eighteen days into the bombing, The New York Times reported: "American forces have mistakenly hit a residential area in Kabul." Twice, U.S. planes bombed Red Cross warehouses, and a Red Cross spokesman said: "Now we've got 55,000 people without that food or blankets, with nothing at all."

An Afghan elementary school-teacher told a Washington Post reporter at the Pakistan border: "When the bombs fell near my house and my babies started crying, I had no choice but to run away."

A New York Times report: "The Pentagon acknowledged that a Navy F/A-18 dropped a 1,000-pound bomb on Sunday near what officials called a center for the elderly. . . . The United Nations said the building was a military hospital. . . . Several hours later, a Navy F-14 dropped two 500-pound bombs on a residential area northwest of Kabul." A U.N. official told a New York Times reporter that an American bombing raid on the city of Herat had used cluster bombs, which spread deadly "bomblets" over an area of twenty football fields. This, the Times reporter wrote,"was the latest of a growing number of accounts of American bombs going astray and causing civilian casualties."

An A.P. reporter was brought to Karam, a small mountain village hit by American bombs, and saw houses reduced to rubble. "In the hospital in Jalalabad, twenty-five miles to the east, doctors treated what they said were twenty-three victims of bombing at Karam, one a child barely two months old, swathed in bloody bandages," according to the account. "Another child, neighbors said, was in the hospital because the bombing raid had killed her entire family. At least eighteen fresh graves were scattered around the village."

The city of Kandahar, attacked for seventeen straight days, was reported to be a ghost town, with more than half of its 500,000 people fleeing the bombs. The city's electrical grid had been knocked out. The city was deprived of water, since the electrical pumps could not operate. A sixty-year-old farmer told the A.P. reporter, "We left in fear of our lives. Every day and every night, we hear the roaring and roaring of planes, we see the smoke, the fire. . . . I curse them both--the Taliban and America."

A New York Times report from Pakistan two weeks into the bombing campaign told of wounded civilians coming across the border. "Every half-hour or so throughout the day, someone was brought across on a stretcher. . . . Most were bomb victims, missing limbs or punctured by shrapnel. . . . A young boy, his head and one leg wrapped in bloodied bandages, clung to his father's back as the old man trudged back to Afghanistan."

That was only a few weeks into the bombing, and the result had already been to frighten hundreds of thousands of Afghans into abandoning their homes and taking to the dangerous, mine-strewn roads. The "war against terrorism" has become a war against innocent men, women, and children, who are in no way responsible for the terrorist attack on New York.

And yet there are those who say this is a "just war."

Terrorism and war have something in common. They both involve the killing of innocent people to achieve what the killers believe is a good end. I can see an immediate objection to this equation: They (the terrorists) deliberately kill innocent people; we (the war makers) aim at "military targets," and civilians are killed by accident, as "collateral damage."

Is it really an accident when civilians die under our bombs? Even if you grant that the intention is not to kill civilians, if they nevertheless become victims, again and again and again, can that be called an accident? If the deaths of civilians are inevitable in bombing, it may not be deliberate, but it is not an accident, and the bombers cannot be considered innocent. They are committing murder as surely as are the terrorists.

The absurdity of claiming innocence in such cases becomes apparent when the death tolls from "collateral damage" reach figures far greater than the lists of the dead from even the most awful act of terrorism. Thus, the "collateral damage" in the Gulf War caused more people to die--hundreds of thousands, if you include the victims of our sanctions policy--than the very deliberate terrorist attack of September 11. The total of those who have died in Israel from Palestinian terrorist bombs is somewhere under 1,000. The number of dead from "collateral damage" in the bombing of Beirut during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was roughly 6,000.

We must not match the death lists--it is an ugly exercise--as if one atrocity is worse than another. No killing of innocents, whether deliberate or "accidental," can be justified. My argument is that when children die at the hands of terrorists, or--whether intended or not--as a result of bombs dropped from airplanes, terrorism and war become equally unpardonable.

Let's talk about "military targets." The phrase is so loose that President Truman, after the nuclear bomb obliterated the population of Hiroshima, could say: "The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians."

What we are hearing now from our political leaders is, "We are targeting military objectives. We are trying to avoid killing civilians. But that will happen, and we regret it." Shall the American people take moral comfort from the thought that we are bombing only "military targets"?

The reality is that the term "military" covers all sorts of targets that include civilian populations. When our bombers deliberately destroy, as they did in the war against Iraq, the electrical infrastructure, thus making water purification and sewage treatment plants inoperable and leading to epidemic waterborne diseases, the deaths of children and other civilians cannot be called accidental.

Recall that in the midst of the Gulf War, the U.S. military bombed an air raid shelter, killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that.

I suggest that the history of bombing--and no one has bombed more than this nation--is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like "accident," "military targets," and "collateral damage."

Indeed, in both World War II and in Vietnam, the historical record shows that there was a deliberate decision to target civilians in order to destroy the morale of the enemy--hence the firebombing of Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo, the B-52s over Hanoi, the jet bombers over peaceful villages in the Vietnam countryside. When some argue that we can engage in "limited military action" without "an excessive use of force," they are ignoring the history of bombing. The momentum of war rides roughshod over limits.

The moral equation in Afghanistan is clear. Civilian casualties are certain. The outcome is uncertain. No one knows what this bombing will accomplish--whether it will lead to the capture of Osama Bin Laden (perhaps), or the end of the Taliban (possibly), or a democratic Afghanistan (very unlikely), or an end to terrorism (almost certainly not).

And meanwhile, we are terrorizing the population (not the terrorists, they are not easily terrorized). Hundreds of thousands are packing their belongings and their children onto carts and leaving their homes to make dangerous journeys to places they think might be more safe.

Not one human life should be expended in this reckless violence called a "war against terrorism."

We might examine the idea of pacifism in the light of what is going on right now. I have never used the word "pacifist" to describe myself, because it suggests something absolute, and I am suspicious of absolutes. I want to leave openings for unpredictable possibilities. There might be situations (and even such strong pacifists as Gandhi and Martin Luther King believed this) when a small, focused act of violence against a monstrous, immediate evil would be justified.

In war, however, the proportion of means to ends is very, very different. War, by its nature, is unfocused, indiscriminate, and especially in our time when the technology is so murderous, inevitably involves the deaths of large numbers of people and the suffering of even more. Even in the "small wars" (Iran vs. Iraq, the Nigerian war, the Afghan war), a million people die. Even in a "tiny" war like the one we waged in Panama, a thousand or more die.

Scott Simon of NPR wrote a commentary in The Wall Street Journal on October 11 entitled, "Even Pacifists Must Support This War." He tried to use the pacifist acceptance of self-defense, which approves a focused resistance to an immediate attacker, to justify this war, which he claims is "self-defense." But the term "self-defense" does not apply when you drop bombs all over a country and kill lots of people other than your attacker. And it doesn't apply when there is no likelihood that it will achieve its desired end.

Pacifism, which I define as a rejection of war, rests on a very powerful logic. In war, the means--indiscriminate killing--are immediate and certain; the ends, however desirable, are distant and uncertain.

Pacifism does not mean "appeasement." That word is often hurled at those who condemn the present war on Afghanistan, and it is accompanied by references to Churchill, Chamberlain, Munich. World War II analogies are conveniently summoned forth when there is a need to justify a war, however irrelevant to a particular situation. At the suggestion that we withdraw from Vietnam, or not make war on Iraq, the word "appeasement" was bandied about. The glow of the "good war" has repeatedly been used to obscure the nature of all the bad wars we have fought since 1945.

Let's examine that analogy. Czechoslovakia was handed to the voracious Hitler to "appease" him. Germany was an aggressive nation expanding its power, and to help it in its expansion was not wise.

But today we do not face an expansionist power that demands to be appeased. We ourselves are the expansionist power--troops in Saudi Arabia, bombings of Iraq, military bases all over the world, naval vessels on every sea--and that, along with Israel's expansion into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has aroused anger.

It was wrong to give up Czechoslovakia to appease Hitler. It is not wrong to withdraw our military from the Middle East, or for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories, because there is no right to be there. That is not appeasement. That is justice.

Opposing the bombing of Afghanistan does not constitute "giving in to terrorism" or "appeasement." It asks that other means be found than war to solve the problems that confront us. King and Gandhi both believed in action--nonviolent direct action, which is more powerful and certainly more morally defensible than war.

To reject war is not to "turn the other cheek," as pacifism has been caricatured. It is, in the present instance, to act in ways that do not imitate the terrorists.

The United States could have treated the September 11 attack as a horrific criminal act that calls for apprehending the culprits, using every device of intelligence and investigation possible. It could have gone to the United Nations to enlist the aid of other countries in the pursuit and apprehension of the terrorists.

There was also the avenue of negotiations. (And let's not hear: "What? Negotiate with those monsters?" The United States negotiated with--indeed, brought into power and kept in power--some of the most monstrous governments in the world.) Before Bush ordered in the bombers, the Taliban offered to put bin Laden on trial. This was ignored. After ten days of air attacks, when the Taliban called for a halt to the bombing and said they would be willing to talk about handing bin Laden to a third country for trial, the headline the next day in The New York Times read: "President Rejects Offer by Taliban for Negotiations," and Bush was quoted as saying: "When I said no negotiations, I meant no negotiations."

That is the behavior of someone hellbent on war. There were similar rejections of negotiating possibilities at the start of the Korean War, the war in Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the bombing of Yugoslavia. The result was an immense loss of life and incalculable human suffering.

International police work and negotiations were--still are--alternatives to war. But let's not deceive ourselves; even if we succeeded in apprehending bin Laden or, as is unlikely, destroying the entire Al Qaeda network, that would not end the threat of terrorism, which has potential recruits far beyond Al Qaeda.

To get at the roots of terrorism is complicated. Dropping bombs is simple. It is an old response to what everyone acknowledges is a very new situation. At the core of unspeakable and unjustifiable acts of terrorism are justified grievances felt by millions of people who would not themselves engage in terrorism but from whose ranks terrorists spring.

Those grievances are of two kinds: the existence of profound misery-- hunger, illness--in much of the world, contrasted to the wealth and luxury of the West, especially the United States; and the presence of American military power everywhere in the world, propping up oppressive regimes and repeatedly intervening with force to maintain U.S. hegemony.

This suggests actions that not only deal with the long-term problem of terrorism but are in themselves just.

Instead of using two planes a day to drop food on Afghanistan and 100 planes to drop bombs (which have been making it difficult for the trucks of the international agencies to bring in food), use 102 planes to bring food.

Take the money allocated for our huge military machine and use it to combat starvation and disease around the world. One-third of our military budget would annually provide clean water and sanitation facilities for the billion people in the world who have none.

Withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia, because their presence near the holy shrines of Mecca and Medina angers not just bin Laden (we need not care about angering him) but huge numbers of Arabs who are not terrorists.

Stop the cruel sanctions on Iraq, which are killing more than a thousand children every week without doing anything to weaken Saddam Hussein's tyrannical hold over the country.

Insist that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories, something that many Israelis also think is right, and which will make Israel more secure than it is now.

In short, let us pull back from being a military superpower, and become a humanitarian superpower.
Let us be a more modest nation. We will then be more secure. The modest nations of the world don't face the threat of terrorism.

Such a fundamental change in foreign policy is hardly to be expected. It would threaten too many interests: the power of political leaders, the ambitions of the military, the corporations that profit from the nation's enormous military commitments.

Change will come, as at other times in our history, only when American citizens-- becoming better informed, having second thoughts after the first instinctive support for official policy--demand it. That change in citizen opinion, especially if it coincides with a pragmatic decision by the government that its violence isn't working, could bring about a retreat from the military solution.

It might also be a first step in the rethinking of our nation's role in the world. Such a rethinking contains the promise, for Americans, of genuine security, and for people elsewhere, the beginning of hope.

Hello

As many of you may know by now, I have been without e-mail and internet =
access for the past week. Excite@home.com, my former internet provider =
went bankrupt. AT & T Broadband took over, but the transition wasn't =
completed until today.

I'm told that messages sent to me in the past week have been returned. =
Some of you have been expecting to hear from me and I have been =
expecting to hear from you. My new e-mail address is vfrazer@attbi.com.

If you mail me now, I should be able to receive your messages and =
respond to them.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Then why don't the people running it (as I support my Runaway Spoon Press)?

Why make the losers of the contest support it? >>

But of course no one is forced to enter any contest.  That is hardly the
point.  Withholding the names of the judges encourages entries from poets who
might have no chance at all from the getgo.  I, for example, serve as one
judge of a prize administered by my college.  I am clearly the only member of
an otherwise very conservative panel who even considers formally innovative
work.  Visual poets like Bob have no chance at all.  I have urged the prize
administrators to at least publish a disclaimer, or something that might
suggest the kind of poetry most on the panel are looking for.  But noooo . .
. the administrators are well aware that such a statement would limit the
number of submissions and entry fees.  Every time I see an submission from a
language poet, or a visual poet, or Beat poet, or anyone with a distinctive
voice that doesn't sound like it came from the creative workshop factory, I
cringe because I know the tastes of the other judges.  I know such poets, no
matter how good they are, are losers going in.  Why do I continue to serve?
Because at least I'm able to to get a poet who is moderately innovative into
the runner-up category, however rare that success is.  Somebody has to fight
for the unconventional.

In no way did I suggest, or am I suggesting, that prize administrators or
panels do not have the right to follow their tastes.  We all do that.  Nor
did I single out the San Francisco Prize for criticism.  However, if the
judge knows the names of the contestants, or is well known to prefer a
certain kind of writing, then objective evaluation is likely unlikely.
Again, I have no idea if this is the case with the San Francisco Prize which
may be a good bet for alternative writers, a bad one for conventional lyric
poets.  And that may change year by year, depending on the judge.  But
publicizing the judge up front, as some awards do, would provide the sort of
necessary information to potential contestants that would help them exercise
their freedom to submit or not.  No?

Best, Bill

Believe me, as an academic I know very well how underfunded such things are.
And I don't doubt that the Poetry center has done excellent work.  I'm

I so don't agree that poetry doesn't exist outside of
the academy. Most social gatherings I go to (granted I
am Arab and Indian) incorporate poetry of some kind.
Most parties I go to have some or another free-styling
better than most of what's in the Paris Review
anyways.

I worked at a factory (the Motorola factory in Elma,
NY) before (yes) going back to grad school, and I used
to read poems to my co-workers all the time and they
couldn't get enough of it. Philip Levine (well,
obviously) and Mary Oliver were their favorites but
recently I've read Fanny Howe and Rosmarie Waldrop
(the book with all the traffic signals in it--what's
that called?) to some "not-college-educated" friends
and they went nuts for it. One "non-literary" friend
went so nuts for a Jean Valentine poem (one from the
last book) she made me read it into her voice-mail as
a greeting.

People--even Wal Mart shoppers--like poetry. They've
just been tricked. I mean, how and why they've been
tricked is a completely separate question which I
guess everyone has an opinion on.

-------------------------------------------------------

I interpreted the response from Maxine Chernoff ("As
for a reading fee, the university does not support the
prize"), Prof. of Creative Writing, SFSU, differently.

I understood "does not support" to mean: The
University (herewith!) bears no endorsement or
responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the contents
of the winning book, nor for the actions of the
contest promoters (nor their monetary accounts/fees).

I.e., the "San Francisco State University Poetry
Center Prize" (SFSUPC Prize) is to SFSU

as the St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter is to St.
Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery:

a coincidence of name only, going back to proximity of
origin (the kind of relation Ginsberg and Kerouac had
to Columbia). The names "SFSUPC" or "SFSUPC Poetry
Prize" could move elsewhere, out of state, and are not
the property or an expression of the University.

SFSU might not ~like~ what the SFSUPC Prize publishes
(or what the SFSUPC presents).  If the SFSUPC Prize
accepted funding from SFSU, the contest's outcome
might have to be negotiated with the arbiters of SFSU.
 Etc.


The revenues from contest fees are notoriously
unmonitored and unaccounted for; there is not a single
poetry contest that makes the ledgers for its fees
available to the fee-payers who are underwriting the
enterprise (fee-payers shld. be considered benefactors
or ~shareholders~ in the outcome of the prize; an
annual prize shld. make public "annual reports" as to
its income/spending/surplus/debt): fees are routinely
used to syphon in money toward other purposes (pay for
workers unrelated to a prize).  And contests routinely
bring in a ~very large~ fixed number of MSs, between
1,000 and 1,600, as of abt. 5 yrs. ago; so fees of $10
or more produce ~significant~ capital: the practice
hinges on the naivite and inappropriateness of the
majority of MSs submitted.  (Contests for "Modern"
poetry books will still accept, deposit and depend on
the check from the isolated, unworldly, stereotypical
shut-in poet whose MSs is rhymed cat poetry.)

No contest ~"has to~ charge a reading fee".  Reading
fees are expedients to slough off the
audience-building entrepreneurship of seeking private
funding or advertisers and, apparently, to make ~more~
money than needed for the publication itself: the
costs that List editors have quoted for publishing
books are way below what can be expected from fees.
(And no one "has to charge" money for something that
doesn't ~"have to"~ exist.)

It's time that the poetry world grows up abt. this
money thing.

(I appreciate the fine community service William James
Austin is shouldering by consistently posting against
this ever-spreading practice of poetry contest fee
pimping.)

        I once was very against the idea of reading fees. I was and still am poor.
So to send 10 dollars was to not have smokes for a few days. I would even
send in without the cash just to make a point, well more to myself as it was
probably thrown away as soon as they saw my red crayon checks or monopoly
money. I never heard back. But now, I can see why this is important. If it's
a worthwhile journal or zine that you admire and want to be a part of then
seven bucks to be involved is a small price. And working from no budgets is
a pain. So I don't know. For me this is part or the reason I try not to
submit to print journals. Online all the way.

        Best, Geoffrey

If you had any idea how underfunded San Francisco State University is, there
would be no question as to why the Poetry Center has to charge a reading
fee. Yes, it is annoying (and perhaps prohibitive) that poets have to pay a
reading fee, but it's amazing the work that the Poetry Center has done over
the years on a shoestring. And the contest is in no way "brand name." Take a
look at the past winners.

If someone can identify & backchannel the source of this quote from T.S.
Eliot, I would be MUCH in your debt. I'd like to use it in a paper. I need
it soon.

"Perhaps the conditions of modern life (think how large a part is now played
in our sensory life by the internal combustion engine!) have altered our
perceptions of rhythm."

Reading at the Berkeley Art Center

Elizabeth Willis
Robin Tremblay McGaw.
Jono Schneider
and Rob Lipton

Saturday December 8 at 7:30 p.m.
at the Berkeley Art Center
1275 Walnut Street in Live Oak Park,
Berkeley

Food and Drink Served

Also in the gallery is the exhibition "The Whole World's Watching"
featuring photographs of the movements for peace and social change during
the '60s and 70s

Directions: By car, take the University Avenue exit, turn right on to
University Avenue. Continue toward the hills until you reach Shattuck Avenue
just before the campus. Turn left. Continue about a half mile north on
Shattuck until Rose Street. Turn right. Go two blocks to Walnut Street, turn
left. The Art Center is half way up the block on the right hand side in the
park. By foot, take Bart to the Berkeley station. Across the street from the
station is the bus stop at Center and Shattuck. Take the bus running along
Shattuck to Rose. Walk two very short blocks toward the hills on Rose. Turn
left on Walnut and walk half a block to the Art Center.

It sounds more daunting than it is. The Art Center is a mere three blocks
from Black Oak Books in north Berkeley. Join us for some excellent reading
and holiday cheer.

>

> brutal attack on today's thousand-plus march in support of
> death row political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal.
>
> According to one eyewitness account, on behalf of a
> right-wing heckler of the rally, bicycle cops towards the
> back of the march rode into the middle of the crowd,
> dismounted their bikes and, wielding guns and batons,
> started indiscriminately beating, pepper-spraying and
> arresting people.  Guns were pointed at peoples' heads;
> others were thrown against cars.
>
> The crowd was marching from the corner of 13th and Locust,
> where 20 years ago Abu-Jamal was arrested for a crime, the
> shooting of police officer Daniel Faulkner, he says he did
> not commit.  Today at that location protesters viewed the
> videotaped confession of Arnold Beverly, who has publicly
> admitted to killing Officer Faulkner for the mob.
>
> As police drew their billy clubs and guns, protesters
> surrounded the cops to try to protect those being arrested
> and/or attacked and chanted, "Let them go! Let them go!"
> and "Shame! Shame!"  Police attacked some of these
> protesters.
>
> Several IAC members were among those attacked, with some
> being maced and others receiving several blows from police
> batons.  Further eyewitness reports include a woman being
> dragged for at least a block, choking and with her skin
> exposed. One person was taken off in an ambulance.  In one
> incident, an African American reporter photographing the
> events from on top a car was grabbed and pulled to the
> ground; the attack left a dent in the car.
>
> After the attacks, the march proceeded to the final indoor
> rally at Philadelphia's Ethical Society, where more spoke
> out in favor of Mumia's demand for his release based
> primarily on Beverly's confession.  Protesters saw the
> attacks as further efforts on the part of the
> Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police to prevent the
> truth about Mumia's case from emerging.  Those present
> also watched fresh video footage of the police attacks.
> Currently a number of protesters who traveled to
> Philadelphia are staying there to provide legal and
> political support to those who have been falsely
> incarcerated.

Dear Listees,

A friend of mine is writing a reception history of Christopher Smart's work.
I was wondering if anyone might be aware of interest in Smart's poetry on
the part of contemporary poets.  It occurs to me that Smart is sometimes
mentioned as a kind of proto-avant-gardist--for example in Rasula and
McCaffrey's "Imagining Language" (now in paperback and a must-own book,
incidentally).  Smart often gets passing credit for his early free-verse
experimentalism, though that credit has traditionally been attributed as
much to Smart's madness as to his poetic program.  In one sense, it's
possible to read Smart's poetry (much like Hopkins' or Herbert's innovations
on behalf of devotional poetry) as displaying a kind of
anti-nominalism--whereby manipulating poetic form becomes a way of
recovering language from its fallen state.  This to me seems a much more
appealing reading of Smart's poetics than the standard traditional reading
of Smart as anomalous madman.

I'm aware of Thomas Vogler's excellent article on Smart in Sulfur, and Allen
Ingram's work as well.  But I'd greatly appreciate hearing from anyone who
might know of other references to--or appropriations of--Smart's poetics by
contemporary experimentalists.

Hyperion Signs a Best-Selling, if Young, Poet

By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

attie J. T. Stepanek, an 11-year- old with muscular dystrophy who has
written two best-selling books of poetry, has sold Hyperion the right to
publish editions of his two previously published and three forthcoming
volumes of verse.

The contract was negotiated last week by Robert Barnett, a lawyer in
Washington who has negotiated book contracts for President Bill Clinton and
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others.

Hyperion, a division of the Walt Disney Company (news/quote), will pay Mr.
Stepanek an undisclosed advance and split some of the proceeds from the
sales of his books with VSP Books, which has published two previous volumes
of his poems.

VSP, a small publisher based in Alexandria, Va., initially published 200
copies of Mr. Stepanek's first collection, "Heartsongs," earlier this year.
Cheryl Barnes, publisher of VSP, has said she printed the copies to cheer
him up while he was in the hospital, as a favor to his mother, who has an
adult form of muscular dystrophy.

VSP has now printed a total of more than 500,000 copies of Mr. Stepanek's
first collection and a second, called "Journey Through Heartsongs." Mr.
Stepanek appeared on the Jerry Lewis telethon in September and on Oprah
Winfrey's television show in October.

Mr. Stepanek was introduced to Mr. Barnett three weeks ago.

Robert S. Miller, president of Hyperion, said of the contract: "It will be a
substantial advance because the potential was substantial. And it will be
well spent on the enormous cost of Mattie's medical needs."

Hello, all. The Bush administration was unable to show any hard link
between Iraq and the attacks of Sept. 11, so it has declared that the
simple possession of weapons of mass destruction by a "rogue state" is
terrorism. Now, the House International Relations Committee is considering
a resolution that will declare Iraq's refusal to allow weapons inspectors
in an act of "aggression" against the United States (weapons inspectors
were removed by the United States shortly before the December 1998 "Desert
Fox" bombing campaign, and Iraq has not allowed any back in). This is a
clear move to authorize large-scale bombing of Iraq. For those of you
living in the United States, the following action alert has information on
what to do. For everyone else, please do take note. It's not too early to
start thinking about demonstrations.

For more information about Iraq, see http://www.casi.org.uk,
http://www.endthewar.org, or http://www.fair.org/international/iraq.html

In Solidarity,

Crisis Update
PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY
International Affairs Committee Drafting Resolution to Authorize Bombing of
Iraq
Rep. Ron Paul Circulating Congressional Letter in Opposition

Friends - As many of you know, there has been immense pressure building
recently within the Bush Administration, and the media, to make Iraq the
next target in our unending war against terrorism. Now a number of members
of Congress have written a letter urging President Bush to do just that,
and this coming Tuesday the House International Relations Committee will be
drafting a resolution to authorize attacks on Iraq. (Much greater attacks
than what we have been doing already, aimed at overthrowing Saddam
Hussein.) It will, among other things, stipulate that any refusal of Iraq
to grant access to UN inspectors to any site in Iraq will be considered an
"act of aggression against the United States."

Con. Ron Paul of Texas is circulating a letter opposing any attacks on
Iraq. While not a pacifist letter, it does clearly state that there will be
massive loss of life if we do this, that pretty much the rest of the world
opposes us doing this, that even our allies freely acknowledge that there
is no evidence that Iraq had anything to do with the September 11 bombing,
and that taking military action against them would thus go well beyond the
original resolution authorizing use of force in Afghanistan.

Please circulate this message to all your group and personal email
listservs, and urge your group members, colleagues or friends to call their
Representatives immediately (as in Monday and Tuesday) to speak against the
bombing of Iraq, and to urge them to sign on to Rep. Paul's letter. While
all members of Congress are important, the members of the House
International Relations Committee are particularly so, and they are listed
below.

I find ads helpful as well, Millie.  my former concern was that ads now
predominate this list. once upon a time discussion predominated.  i found
the difference in three years to be remarkable, and sad, too.

considering that really only three or four people responded to this stark
insight into this list, i no longer see a point for my concern.  i made my
attempt to see if i could encourage change.  clearly after you me jeffrey
and a couple of backchannelers, it appears there is no point for me to
pursue this.  things are as they are.

bye bye listmates.  it's been real.  see you somewhere else some other day,
perhaps some other list?

I find the advertisements for readings to be very helpful.  They list many
events not on the NYC Poetry Calendar.  This things on the calendar seem to
be mostly open readings, many of the "slam" variety in which a poem has to
pack a punch and keep the audience entertained/laughing/indignant at some
societal injustice.

You get absolutely nowhere reading (rather than performing) a Language poem
there:  Most language poems are interesting for the interactions between the
lines or stanzas, where each piece of a poem is seen as a sort of
independent entity which bounces off the other pieces of the poem and
creates linkages between the ideas.  But the individaul pieces of the
language poem are not of the sort needed to keep people laughing; often they
are everyday things, like in Silliman's alpahbet project or
surreal-but-not-funny as in Leslie Scalapino's work or Clark Coolodge's (not
sure if he counts as a language poet, though).

Likewise, a formalist poem also gets no encouragement at these poetry
slams-- formalist poems are too boring for such a setting, and they often
depend on a lot of literary allusions and depend on the reader's knowledge
of the history of poetry.  This is a problem at slams.  I recently got up
and read a surreal poem about Agamemnon, and I felt it necessary to tell who
A. was and how his bitchy wife Clytemnestra bumped him off when he got back
from the war, because by then she had found another guy and didn't want her
husband putting an end to her affair (you can see the tone I felt forced to
adopt...)  you can't depend on a slam audience knowing anything, except the
work of the regulars at the slam...

It is my opinion that slams generate a kind of poetry which is fun to listen
to but which seems very shallow if you read the poems.  I don't have
anything against slam poetry.  It's usually more "fun" to listen to the slam
poems than to listen to poems at a nonslam venue's open readings.  And often
even very good poetry is too hard to appreciate when it is unfamiliar and
you only hear it.  To understand a poem, you have to remember all the
previous lines in the poem, to see how the poem builds meaning or to catch
refernces between the various sections.  Moreover, people actually come to
slam events, which makes you feel good about the state of poetry.  But I
have noticed that trying to please the slam people has been bad for my work.
So I have stopped going to these events.  Unfortunately, I also don't go
often to the readings I see advertised here by poets whose work I admire.
But I'd never even know about these readings without the list.

Thank you for your lovely, Bourdievian numbers.  (Your
on-List silence had been noticeable. I heard you hurt
your shin.  Condolences.  And I was worried that maybe
your silence meant you were cooking up some sort of
mischievous heteronym!  :)  I'm relieved to see you're
putting your time to good use.)  Something seems
muddled with your statistics for advertisements,
though: 7.5 doesn't seem to correspond to 65,
numerically, and you might've done better to stick it
out for an additional count of 62 (= 214 - 149), I
think, especially with randomness, as comparison
between samples of unequal size involve chi-factors or
r or something . . . but otherwise, I find these
numbers neo-Pythagorean in their sense of "beauty is
truth, truth beauty, that is all you know on earth and
all you need to know," and charming.

I felt tempted to do the same myself --- but upping
nutritional supplements of Vitamin Shoppe 1500 MG
Amino Complex to 10 tabs a day seems to have moderated
my counting mania --- and I was more interested in
plotting ~who~ responds to ~whose~ posts and threads,
for more of an analysis of power and
follow-the-leader.

I also find the number of advertisements distressing.
It's like being on one of those servers with pop-up
ads that keep cluttering the screen.  One waste of
time there, for me, is that poetry-dvertisers do not
as a rule mark their subject header with their
location,--- so I waste clicks opening ads for
interesting poets' readings that are then
disappointingly unreachable in far-away States I can't
attend (given the impounding of my private jet), not
that I ever leave the house anyway.  So, (#1) I think
it wld. at least be thoughtful of advertisers to mark
location in subject header, . . . although I can
understand that reputation accumulates through the
redundancy of name, and why anyone wld. be motivated
just to infiltrate Gertrude Stein Gertrude Stein
Gertrude Stein at every loophole, "fame"-building.

I've wondered if Christopher W. Alexander or Prof.
Bernstein couldn't somehow "cordon off" or segregate
ads from poetics discussion.  In print, ads are
generally separated to the margins and not
interspersed with "articles."  --- Pedagogically,
insofar as the List is State U. educational outreach,
it's like mixing in Save Fifty Cents coupons with
class notes. --- Electronically, segregation might be
effort, though (develop a co-site/cache), . . . but
maybe not all that much effort: even free servers like
Yahoo provide instantaneous group resources that
poetry-advertisers cld. be given a one-time "warning"
to post to, for those interested to consult, and then
otherwise summarily blocked/deleted (as exploitative,
mercenary, whatever).  I've even considered as public
"penance" taking it upon myself to maintain an on-line
Poetry Calendar such items could be re-directed to and
plotted more helpfully, systematically, the way Sharon
Matling (name?) single-handedly started the NYC Poetry
Calendar as a 2-sided broadsheet that became a
company.

I do strongly agree that it wld. improve readering for
ads to be segregated somehow.


There's something terribly ~American~ in this
anti-social Buy This/Go There panhandling that's done
on-List, by poets (communicators!) who have total
impunity abt. addressing a community only to try to
change peers into audience.  Very lively, daily
discussion (although abt. work of a different "taste"
than the Buff' List's) goes on at PoetryEtc, for
example, which is predominately UK and AU/NZ sign-ons,
who don't seem as thoroughly ~permeated by
mercantilism~ as Americans.

I'm very easily manipulated by advertisements (which
is why I don't watch television or go to the movies,
and have trouble with newspapers and magazines), ---
psychology finds that some types are objectively more
"hypnotizable" by ads/promos! --- and it's distressing
to find my relation to poetry being bent into docile
consumerism: I spend, easily, between a hundred and
two hundred a month on poetry, average, much of it via
SPD or checks to on-List book/journal advertisers.
That's okay but, once upon a time, my naive attachment
to poetry was because an endlessly re-readable enigma
masterpiece and nothing but paper and pen/typewriter
was a ~refuge~ from consumerism.

But it isn't only the alienation that poets are
dousing colleagues with here that bothers me (I find
it tacky if the automatic footer at the bottom of a
poet's discussion post leads to a book of theirs and a
price for where to send for it, too): it's the lack of
~creativity,~ or imagination, or even--- guile! in how
matter-of-factly and mass media-like they style their
"Satisfy Me" commands.  Utopian, I think it's holding
back a potential new ~poetry~ of inventive free market
gamesmanship, a "litvertizing," as it were, where
poetry would grown into being ironically/ambiguously
conjoined with the zeitgeist of
advertisement-seduction.  What were all those names of
friends doing in New York School poetry, if not a
collective stategy of shared advertising and
name-redundancy?  (How ~could~ Bill Berkson be
advertised on-List this week if, in the golden age of
genuine inspired "litvertizing," Frank O'Hara hadn't
paved a reptutation for him by dint of including his
name in O'Hara immortality?) Forgive me if it seems
vain of me to use myself as an example, but it took
much more than an hour to put together and post my
shoddy little

http://www.geocities.com/jeffreyjullich/EUNOIAN.LITTLE.LEXICON.htm
,

with no self-interest in Bok's reputation other than I
genuinely find him to be among the two or three most
remarkable.  It was advertising, though, disinterested
advertising, labor-intensive advertising. And I was
lead to doing that, and to ordering Bok's book and to
hearing him on the ~Cabinet~ CD as a result of Brian
Kim Stefans posting a micro-review that brought out
the nature of ~Eunoia~ in a way I'd previously missed,
and as a result of Christopher W. Alexander bringing
out points about glossolalia that mentioned ~Cabinet.~

Already here, it shows, I'm more concerned
about/focussed on the on-List ~advertisements,~
whereas you're more irked by the absence of discussion
(the latest ~Fence~ takes uniquely unprecedented and
~admirable~ candor in presenting their distributors'
actual print-outs--- with sales figures!
Congratulations, Rebecca/Rebecca-informants while
Rebecca is on her doubtlessly tiring but envigorating
~Manderley~ road show.  The charts should be framed,
it's so good. --- Tragic, hopefully not, that their
optimism was fueled by the "irrational exuberance"
[Greenspan] of the now antediluvian lost "New
Economy," and that recession nihilism may well show
Fence's charts' upward curve to have been sub-sets of
a larger upward slope mania that's been broken by
three airplanes and thousands and thousands of deaths,
"jinxed").

Maybe that's because I see advertising as an
unstoppable semiotic that's really a major vehicle for
graphic artists, designers, actors, models,
epigrammatists, etc., and quite "avant-garde" in its
ingenuities.  And I'm mainly disappointed by how
anemically we pursue marketing and how uncreative and
ascii ads are, on-List.

[mar-/mar-]:

I don't think we're marginalized; I think we're bad at
marketing.

But thanks for your own statistical avant-gardisme,
--- the future is Neo-Pythagorean! --- which I read as
a Herron poetic artefact in and of itself.  Bar charts
would've been nice (Silliman did Armantrout pie charts
in ~A Wild Salience~).

Jeffrey

P.S. The "BICKERING" and fighting that you condone as
the spice of discussion also greatly contributes, I
suspect, to the drop-off in discussion: you have a
thicker hide for and propensity toward it than many.
Poets are sensitive plants, and people of substance
aren't going to risk their vulnerability where at any
moment their "lessers" are given full clearance to
pounce and lash out over imaginary slights.  (But I'm
debilitatingly conflict-avoidant {meek!}.)

Professional academics tend to participate less
seriously in on-List discussion, too.  Perhaps they
see it as "work," or their interlocutors as being
unqualified; they're more "careful," though.  On-List
participation sometimes parallels how long a
batch/klatsch enjoys ~grad student~ status together.
They clam up once they've gotten tenure-track
appointments.

P.P.S. I rented ~Being John Malkovich~ the other night
to see the Emily Dickinson puppet, and the puppeteer's
employer, Lester Inc., reminded me of your
coincidentally named marionette Lester.

I know what you mean as one of the losers you reference.  I spent a lot of
time prep[aring a chapbook for the Pavement Saw prize, and I was not
surprised that I didn't win.  I didn't expect to win.  But I was annoyed at
them when I got tha sample chapbook by one of their previous winners; it was
all realistic/spill my thoughts and totally un-innovative. I had done a
chapbook with surreal poems, languagy things, etc., and seeing who won made
me realize that I didn't have a chance from the moment they read the first
poem.

It would be grate if they put in a statement about what the judes like.
they are perfectly free to like what they want to like, but it is annoying
to have no chance at all because you didn't know their style.  I could
actually have put together a chapbook of poems about family issues, poems
about relationships, all in standard MFA program free verse, and I would
have had a better chance (though I assume I still wouldn't have won as I am
a relative beginner in these things...)

But of course no one is forced to enter any contest.  That is hardly the
point.  Withholding the names of the judges encourages entries from poets
who
might have no chance at all from the getgo.  I, for example, serve as one
judge of a prize administered by my college.  I am clearly the only member
of
an otherwise very conservative panel who even considers formally innovative
work.  Visual poets like Bob have no chance at all.  I have urged the prize
administrators to at least publish a disclaimer, or something that might
suggest the kind of poetry most on the panel are looking for.  But noooo . .
. the administrators are well aware that such a statement would limit the
number of submissions and entry fees.  Every time I see an submission from a
language poet, or a visual poet, or Beat poet, or anyone with a distinctive
voice that doesn't sound like it came from the creative workshop factory, I
cringe because I know the tastes of the other judges.  I know such poets, no
matter how good they are, are losers going in.  Why do I continue to serve?
Because at least I'm able to to get a poet who is moderately innovative into
the runner-up category, however rare that success is.  Somebody has to fight
for the unconventional.

In no way did I suggest, or am I suggesting, that prize administrators or
panels do not have the right to follow their tastes.  We all do that.  Nor
did I single out the San Francisco Prize for criticism.  However, if the
judge knows the names of the contestants, or is well known to prefer a
certain kind of writing, then objective evaluation is likely unlikely.
Again, I have no idea if this is the case with the San Francisco Prize which
may be a good bet for alternative writers, a bad one for conventional lyric
poets.  And that may change year by year, depending on the judge.  But
publicizing the judge up front, as some awards do, would provide the sort of
necessary information to potential contestants that would help them exercise
their freedom to submit or not.  No?

Best, Bill

The List Etal. If the US extends its agressive war to Iraq, that's ok, but
remember that Iraq Iran etc are fairly (or relatively scarcely populated): a
nuclear bomb(s) over there might convert some sand into possibly useful
glass: but a (yet to be born!) new generation of physics-minded "terrorists"
freedom-fighters or just plain old religious mad-people, might make the next
"Big One" say 8 strategically  placed nuclear bombs - suggested targets: NY,
Los Angeles, San Fransisco,Washington, Chicago,Disneyland, anywhere in
Texas, and Colorado for Auld Lange Syne - assembled inside the US. And
there's a lot more people in the US, and less sand. (Or failing nukes maybe
hundreds and hundreds of the poetically named "daisy-cutters" that Bush etal
are so fond of).China will then take over the world after obliterating the
Russians and the Japs. New Zealand and Australia will be "burnt" for
grovelling up to the Yanks so I wont survive but then I havent got that long
to go probably so who cares? Richard.

Academic thought yields a different thrill, and wields some other weapons.

As Kathy Lou and I both know as graduates of it, SFSU is underfunded. That
is what she means, what she said. It's a public school, and not a stuffy UC
either.
The Poetry Center is a great institution that in my understanding is only
partially helped by SFSU.
Being housed in an academic setting, to borrow a line from another thread,
makes things strange to view. For example, though CCAC (and formerly New
College) is kind enough to give Small Press Traffic office and venue space,
all of our other expenses (honoraria, publications, publicity, other
overhead, etc) are covered by govt and private funders, and our community.
In this way we remain autonomous, but it is a bit double edged when members
of our dear community assume we are wholly funded by an institution, and
thus don't realize how important it is for them to support us if we are to
continue.
Especially if we are to continue to be autonomous in terms of programming.

Kazim, I'm with you. Recently I was invited to a beach party on Lake Erie,
and we were all asked to bring poetry to welcome in the winter. This has
become an annual event for these folks. I was the only 'poet' there. The rest
of the guests crossed all party lines and a few country ones as well. Poems
by Shel Silverstein to eecummings were read outside around a roaring fire. We
had a blast. I'm not in the academy although I am on this listserve and
neither are most of the writers who write that I know. We make poetry a part
of our everyday lives, and even though I prefer Target to Walmart, I like to
walk through Bloomies every once and while just to see what's going on and
how much it all costs.

Jeffrey--

The Center for the Book Arts is a rare American instituion, the _only_
US publisher of a letter press collection, which opens its doors yearly
to any who wish to submit for the possiblity of having their work appear
in the rarest of editions. There are under 20 active letter press
publishers in the US, 6 I am in personal contact with. Adastra press is
the single place with a *invitational* (not open) consideration of
manuscripts from people whose work they are not familiar with. All of
the other publishers are purely solicited work. As a relative of mine
once said: "a country's worth is measured by their arts, " and, for me,
letter-press is too important a poetry form to allow another press'
dissolution. Understand my bias and commitment also, I distribute one of
Americas finest letter press publishers and will start distributing a
second in 2002.

"(fee-payers shld. be considered benefactors
or ~shareholders~ in the outcome of the prize; an
annual prize shld. make public "annual reports" as to
its income/spending/surplus/debt)"

We give people a book.

"fees are routinely
used to syphon in money toward other purposes (pay for
workers unrelated to a prize)."

Not with us

"And contests routinely
bring in a ~very large~ fixed number of MSs, between
1,000 and 1,600, as of abt. 5 yrs. ago; so fees of $10
or more produce ~significant~ capital:

Not even close to the number.

"the practice
hinges on the naivite and inappropriateness of the
majority of MSs submitted.  (Contests for "Modern"
poetry books will still accept, deposit and depend on
the check from the isolated, unworldly, stereotypical
shut-in poet whose MSs is rhymed cat poetry.)"

These we have hanging on a wall dedicated to poems of this ilk. My
favorite this year was a rhyming poem in the shape of a tea pot about
tea.

Cost for us on the chapbook: $7 entry
$500 prize
2000 envelopes x .34= $680
envelopes, labels, new sealing marker etc $76
Photocopy
2000 x 3, 1000 x1=7000, $140

Total cost: $1396
Entries last year: 203 x7= 1421
which meant we did not have a judge for $250.
and we gave away 110 copies of the chapbook to people who wanted it.

For us, the chapbook prize gives us a chance to publish someone who
would not regularly send to us as well a chance to publish individual
poems from people we are not ordinarily in contact with. We consider
this important.

I believe the blame should be placed correctly: there are many factors
integral to the system, not the publishing community as a whole.
Individual places: yes. One notable example, two years ago P&W wanted
the prize money to be raised to $1000 for chapbook contest
announcements. I refused, so we do a lot of work for the same number of
submissions. We might cut the contest soon, who knows.

It's time that the poetry world grows up abt. this
money thing.

Be well

I am a reader of Smart and am quite taken by his work, particularly and
obviously his poem about Jeffrey his cat.  It is strikingly contemporary
and feline-accurate.  Edward Hirsch has a poem about Smart.

<But publicizing the judge up front, as some awards do, would
provide the sort of necessary information to potential contestants that
would help them exercise their freedom to submit or not.  No?>

The argument you would get from some presses/awards is this: The
final judge is kept secret so that people will not call him or her up and,
well, you know... The problem is that the REAL insiders know who
the judge is, and call up anyway.

Albert Goldbarth told me one time that this happened to him. He, as
judge, was supposed to be kept a secret, but his phone was ringing
constantly with messages from many people who he thought would be
above that sort of thing. Now he stays far away from "prizes". (Too
bad, I know his phone number . . .wink-wink)

Of course, awards aside, the book publication racket is just as bad . . .
with "entry fees" as high as $25.00 now. Some contests get as many as
1,200 entries.  The National Poetry Series . . . the Walt Whitman
Award . . . and these books are getting published on the backs of
writers who the presses don't think are good enough to be published.

I shouldn't have said that, I guess. And I shouldn't say this either: It
cost me $750.00 to get my first book published. And presses don't do
much for thanking those who enter. Mostly I just hear complaints
from them about how hard it is to publish, and how no one wants to
support art these days. So, instead, the "losers" support art these days.

And no, I can't think of a better way to do it.

The nice ones give you something for your entry though: The
Colorado Prize, for instance, gives you a free subscription to The
Colorado Review. Another, I can't remember which it is . . .(The
Journal/OSU Prize maybe?) . . . sends you the winning book . . .

It is also sometimes the case that certain (no doubt worthy artists), who
have yet to receive an award, are set up to win by their friends and
admirers.  Pound and Koch are two such examples.  The reasoning goes
something like this:  "So and so hasn't won a significant award, and deserves
one.  Let's give him ours."  I'm not suggesting this is a commonplace, or
typical of prizes less noted and perhaps more competitive than the Bollingen,
but it happens.  Best, Bill

David:

Thank you.

I don't know what this all refers to, . . . but thank
you.

Letterpress is the loveliest, definitely: I know that
much.

If there were more like what you've tallied here, and
like the distributors' charts that Rebecca Wolff
illustrated the latest Fence with, your elegant
Neo-Pythagoreanism of dollar sign
leadership-by-ledgers would open up a whole new
anti-obscurantist XXIInd century poetics.  It seems
very 2002 of you: nice.

Very convincing.  Sure sold me!  Since you include
your mailing address at the bottom, I'd be happy to
send off  a check to help compensate for

> Entries last year: 203 x7= 1421

minus

> Total cost: $1396

first thing in the morning (if I can just get this
Netscape Programs > Accessories > Calculator to pop up
and stop MR-ing!).

Heck, for a poem about tea shaped like a tea pot, the
sky's the limit! that's what I say.

Please pass this announcement along to anyone you think might be interested;
or, if you're a UA student, please consider applying yourself.

*

Through the UA English Department, two internships to work with the arts
organization POG are available for Spring 2002; one internship is available
for Summer 2002.  Interns receive academic credit.

POG

internships

POG (Poetry Group) is a collective of writers, artists, publishers,
professors, students, and others engaged in promoting the avant-garde art
scene in Tucson.  At present POG’s principal activity is Poetry in Action, a
public art event series committed to crossing boundaries.  Poetry in Action
events, at such sites as Dinnerware Gallery, Orts Dance Theatre, and Las
Artes Studios, typically pair a poet with a visual or musical artist, a
local writer or artist with a visiting one, and a well-known figure with a
younger, emergent one.

POG interns will work on several facets of POG’s programming (mostly for
Poetry in Action), possibly including:
·       contacting visiting poets and other visiting artists and arranging the
details of their visits
·       working with POG members to put together a comfortable visit for our
visiting artists (who are typically in Tucson for 2-3 days)
·       spending some time with visiting artists while they are in Tucson (as part
of our “hosting” activities)
·       helping with site set up and event logistics
·       helping to organize the annual benefit fund-raising dinner
·       working on the bi-annual POG anthology
·       helping to locate possible sources of additional funding for POG (grants,
corporate sponsors)
·       helping to put together publicity materials

During FALL and SPRING semesters POG will likely have two student interns.
One SUMMER internship will also be available.

It’s not necessary for all interns to work on all the above activities.  So
if you’re interested in some of them but not all, it’s still worth applying.

It would be very helpful for at least one intern to possess the following
computer-related skills and requisite technology:
·       ability to receive and send email “attachments” (attached document files)
from home computer (this can’t currently be done from a “u.arizona.edu”
account)
·       ability to work with files in Microsoft Office 2000 format (especially
Word, Excel, and Access)
·       regular internet access
·       ability to do basic layout for fliers and brochures.

Interns are not paid but receive academic credit through the UA English
Department.

I need 19 copies of Lyn Hejinian's *My Life* for a course I'm teaching this
spring at the University of Pennsylvania on "Re-envisioning Personal
Narratives." The Penn Book Center (an independent book seller here) can't
get it, so I called SPD in Berkeley myself and they have *no* copies. Any
suggestions on where to go next?
Many thanks,

Ravi,

You were clearly promoting the wrong kind of books, as you can see from the
forward below.

Sorry to hear about your job.  If you're really desperate for a place, I may
be away at the end of December and in early January.  As you know, my place
is a little too small for a couch, but you'd be welcome to it while I'm out
in Cali.

The Billy Collins piece is guaranteed to entertain you.  He was on the
Newshour last night and I almost did an Elvis to my TV.

Paul

Igor. Actually I like what you've done here. Merrill was a great poet of a
certain style: almost mannerist - an extraordinary brilliance - but not
fundamentally innovative: but then how do we evaluate these things. In a
way: your version or re-appropriation becomes a new poem. A little Williams
perhaps? But I like it: the ending is good: "its impossible to feel" .......
I know ther sense and the meaning of that.  Now I'll look at the original.
Richard.

Igor. Yes: in this case your version is better (well I feel it is)..but its
(the original I mean) still a typical Merrill poem: with some brilliant
images...but not as subtle as some of his others. But possibly editing would
or should involve cutting it entirely ... although its an interesting
"episode"..... rather than re-writing (something I've been known - a bit
arrogantly, something I dont think Id bother with now, or even criticism -
to do when critiquing poets in NZ).  But of the two poems yours is the more
intense as (in this case) the cutting back and the disjunctions etc make it
quite excellent. Regards, Richard.

A Wal-Mart shopper myself, I feel a bit dazed by this phrase: "enact
interiority into the world."  Maybe you can explain it...in terminology I
might understand if I were, say, wandering between cosmetics and
electronics.

I have a feeling that its this sort of articulation that cuts poetry off
from Wal-Mart shoppers -- "a song to catch [my] ritual on"?  is this
American language fissuring or completely falling apart?

On December 15th 2001, from noon to 6pm, in the true spirit
of democracy, Larry Litt will be at White Box to document your
personal opinions, serious to absurd, on the state of homeland
politics, security/insecurity, economics, paranoia, malcontention,
arrogance, and hubris.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHITE BOX presents...

LARRY LITTíS BLAME PROJECT

In Spring 2002 Larry Litt will present a video installation at White Box

featuring opinions from a wide variety of global and native New Yorkers.

The topic: Who or What Is To Blame For The Current State Of
Social And Political Affairs In The Homeland.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like many others believe we have been deliberately and deviously
excluded
from the current Homeland political conversation. Itís time to be
included.

What are you thinking? We the people want to know.

Participants names will not be used.

There is now the distinct possibility of The Blame Project video airing
on
Public Television.

Refreshments will be served.

Reply to be scheduled for a brief recording session.

See you there.
Best,
Larry Litt

Another thing about SFSU is the CW dept sponsors a
book contest for graduate students - alternating
poetry and fiction each year. The winner gets a
perfect bound full length book. It's run through 14
Hills The SFSU Review and is partially supported by
both that magazine and by SFSU student fees through
the university.  All through volunteer labor. I say
this because SFSU does quite a bit to support writing
& I don't like to see it singled out.

It's true that if you don't like the terms of a
contest, don't enter it. It's like saying we all
should agree on how these things are run, which is
ridiculous.

December 12, 2001

Dear Friends of POG:

This is POG’s sixth season of public arts programming.  Over the years we
have brought to Tucson (or co-sponsored) such important writers as Bob
Perelman, David Bromige, Leslie Scalapino, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, Jerry
Rothenberg, Clayton Eshleman, Lydia Davis, Michael Davidson, Erica Hunt,
Juan Felipe Herrera, Norman Fischer, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Rae
Armantrout, David Shapiro, Bernadette Mayer, Juliana Spahr, Bill Luoma, Gil
Ott, Maggie Jaffe, Lyn Hejinian, Diane Glancy, Nora Marks Dauenhauer, Cole
Swensen, Myung Mi Kim, Joe Amato, Hank Lazer, and Jackson Mac Low.  And we
have presented—typically on the same program with such visiting
writers—Arizona writers, musicians, dancers, and visual and dramatic artists
such as Jim Waid, Cynthia Miller, Victor Masayesva, Dan Featherston, A.C.
Huerta, Alex Garza, Ned Schaper, Nancy Solomon, Barbara Penn, Maurice
Grossman, Danny Lopez, the Ge Oidag Village (Big Fields) Traditional
Dancers, Anne Bunker, Barbara Cully, Gwen Ray, Samuel Ace, Eno Washington,
Sharon Wahl, Ted Pope, Jay Vosk, Jesse Seldess, and Dan Buckley.  Both the
range of writers and artists we present and our commitment to cross-over
arts programming make POG a unique and vital presence on the Tucson arts
scene.  Our Fall 2001 program continued this tradition, featuring visiting
poets Peter Gizzi and Mary Rising Higgins and local writers and artists Jon
Anderson, Michael Cherney, Sheila Pitt, and Ann Tracy-Lopez.

Our spring 2002 program is especially exciting.  Along with local visual
artist Chris Morrey we will present visiting writers Robin Blaser, Ron
Silliman, Lisa Jarnot, Benjamin Hollander, and David Matlin.  We also plan
to bring poet Timothy Liu to Tucson, co-sponsoring his appearance at the
Tucson Poetry Festival.

For the Fall 2001- Spring 2002 season POG’s programming expenses are roughly
$8,000.  Approximately $2,000 of this is covered by grants from the Arizona
Commission on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the
Tucson/Pima Arts Counil.  The remaining $6,000 needs to be raised through
event admissions, our annual fundraising dinner, sale of POG-related books
and broadsides, and (to a significant extent) individual and corporate
contributions.

We ask that you consider one of the following ways of supporting POG this
year:

·       purchasing a Season Subscription: $30.  Free admission to all POG events.

·       becoming a POG Sponsor: $50.  For a contribution of $50 or more, you can
become a POG Sponsor.  In exchange you receive a Season Subscription and any
one of the following: a copy of the POG ONE or POG TWO anthology (while
these last), a beautiful POG t-shirt, or an alternate gift still to be
determined

·       becoming a POG Patron: $100.  For a contribution of $100 or more you can
become a POG Patron.  In exchange you receive a Season Subscription and TWO
of the following: POG ONE, POG TWO, a POG t-shirt, or an alternate gift
still to be determined


POG is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.  All contributions
are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you’d like to purchase a Season Subscription or become a POG Sponsor or
POG Patron, you can do so via email by clicking here: mailto:pog@gopog.org
Please tell us whether you wish to be a Subscriber, Sponsor, or Patron.  If

Thank you for your interest in POG programming.

Sincerely,

Tenney Nathanson
President, POG Board of Directors

Hi,

I just received an e-mail attachment today with the heading: Re: Why I was a
bad poet (was: greatness; editors, editing, etc.).  The sender came up as
Noriko Shimoda, but apparently a virus has gotten into her address book and
everyone in her computer has received it--possibly it's spread to POETICS.
This is the 3rd time a virus connected to the "bad poet" thread has
circulated, so if I were you I definitely wouldn't open attachments having
anything to do w/ that aborted conversation.

Best,
Jacques

But Bill. I might critique "capitalism" etc but it doesnt meean that Merrill
with his privliges, money, and many things we dislike (like say Pound or
Wallace Stevens in a different way) about him wasnt a great poet of his
kind; i think that's what is criticised mostly ....sometimes his over
mannerist and near-orgulously ornate complexity of hidden meanings tropes
and references: some of his works are  corruscating.....in a more
"distanced" way he was self-aware - obviously of his gayness so to speak and
the Proustian clossetting of his life, the near suffocation of the soul that
being "priviliged" (is it privilege?) can engender: accusing Merrill of
being too rich is like accusing Mandelstam of being too poor or Trakl too
fond of his sister and too sensitive about the first world war Williams too
arrogantly a male and so on: although I know you're point is the misuse of
privilige. That may be true but  he wouldnt be the first: we are all ( if
only a little bit) editor-grovellors....or at least we show a bit more
deference to those that might publish us: how much more easy to be on good
terms with someone who likes, or says he/she likes ones own work! (Altho to
Millie I'd a say when do you write to order: in other  words what happenned
to "INTEGRITY" that is sourgrapes??! but I have thought of sending in poems
"appropriate" to a certain publication and thus besmirching my soul (my
justification being mammon)...... This all ties in with your (Millie's, my)
comments on book comps and prizes etc Cheers, Richard.

Nice one, Igor!  I've never been a fan of Merrill largely due to his
gerrymandering poetry prizes.  Too rich with too much influence which he
didn't hesitate to exercise.  Scripts For the Pageant is interesting,
though.
 Best, Bill

Wow! You can do that? Write poetry like that? Made-to-order. Wow.

Maybe I'll start a fast-food-poetry contest, dig.


If you backchannel me, I'd like to personally award you a prize.

I solved that problem (altho admittedly only one copy) by photocopying "My
Life" at the Auckland University Library -  "illegal" I know - but I did
purchase "Cell".  There may back issues. Lyn Hejinian herself must be
contactable. Good luck with you courses. Hope all is well, Richard. PS On
ADDALL there is 1 "paper back" (allcopies were wernt they) for about
NZ$11.00 and the rest (3) are about NZ$150.00 (being inscribed or whatever)
so that at least shows that book dealers are aware of her significance if
not otherwise selling them cheaply.  ADDALL includes Abebooks.com, Bilblion,
Justbooks and many others. So one for about US$4.60 plus postage and the
rest ~ US$60.00 plus postage & packaging.

Take of the Continuity Girl


The continuity girl wears a big baggy sweater and carries a clipboard and
Polaroid camera. She walks among the naked actors and actress and takes
notes, whose hand is where, which face is turned towards - and which away
from - the camera. This is amazing. whose finger has a torn nail - whose
breasts already damp - the degree of nipple erection (easy here) - all of
this is carefully noted by the continuity girl. There is sweat running
from a shoulder. The terrorist has his knife to a neck from the left - no,
from the right - side; "R" appears almost by command on the continuity
chart. Is this the numbered scene, the only scene - the continuity girl
knows, takes everything into account. She writes "Alan is gagged tightly,
he is having trouble breathing. If he suffocates, this will be the only
take." She writes "n/g" as the gag is loosened. Azure has been shaved,
head to toe; Azure is constantly shuddering. The continuity girl writes
"Azure moves - lock structure in edit - there is no room for error - there
is nothing but error." The continuity girl notes the bruises and bites on
four, on five, breasts. She notes, "Day 3." She notes, "This is the second
day." It is the goal of the continuity girl to make sure the world is
whole, to make sure it remains contained, coherent, logical beneath the
chaos the rest of us take for granted.

Since the Poetry Center Award is for books that have already been published
it's probably the publisher who pays, not the author. And the publisher is
willing to pay because the award brings some recognition for the book that
the publisher wants. I don't see how anyone is being scammed here. If the
judge happens to be familiar with the author of the winning entry,
well...what credible judge would not be familiar with several writers/books
deserving of the award?

The previous winners have been all over the place.

"seeing who won made me realize that I didn't have a chance from the
moment they read the first poem."

I don't subscribe to one form of poetry.

If you know Pavement Saw's titles they are not of one poetic
affiliation.

For example, this year we published a 92 page poem written 7 languages
by Ivan Arguelles & John M. Bennett on one end & a poet who won the
Larry Levis Poetry prize,  Jeffrey Levine, on the other end.

Did you have a chance? Sure you did.

The Continuity Girl


The continuity girl asserts the fundamental forces of the world. She
writes 5; then 5/under erasure; she writes 4; she exhausts the series. She
adds the cosmological constant, planck's constant; she erases them; she
includes them; she erases them. The slate is a mess. The slate is
unreadable. The slate mimics the world. The slate becomes the world. She
continues to write. She is wearing a baggy sweater and carrying a Polaroid
camera. She carries a great number of accessories: tripod, telephoto,
wide-angle, scanning-transmission electron microscope, interferometer,
neutron telescope. There are a continuous number of scenes; she numbers
them according to the continuum. It is not so difficult to describe the
actors; they are also continuous, and the transformation of props and
objects occurs according to aristotelian logic and fluid morphology. Only
certain quantum leaps give her trouble, but these radical discontinuities
also permit discontinuities within or across scenes, and need not be
annotated. For the rest, everything appears relatively differentiable.
The slate is a mess. The slate is a continuous mess.

CALL FOR SEMINAR AND PANEL PROPOSALS

MSA 4

THE MODERNIST STUDIES ASSOCIATION
FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE

31 October - 3 November, 2002
University of Wisconsin, Madison


The MSA

Founded in 1999, the Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the
study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and
intellectual contexts from the late nineteenth century through the
mid-twentieth. Through its annual conferences and its journal,
Modernism/Modernity, the organization seeks to develop an
international and interdisciplinary forum for exchange among scholars
in this revitalized and rapidly expanding field. For more
information, please see our web site at
http://www.press.jhu.edu/associations/msa.

The fourth annual Modernist Studies Association Conference will be
held at the Monona Terrace Convention Center, a building designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright on the shores of Lake Monona in downtown Madison,
Wisconsin. Sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the
conference will feature plenaries, panels, seminars, poetry readings,
and film screenings related to the study of modernism and modernity.

Calls for seminar and panel proposals follow. Please note that the
deadline for seminar proposals is 15 February 2002, the deadline for
panel proposals 1 May 2002. Please note also that MSA rules do not
allow participants to lead a seminar and present a paper for a panel
at the same conference. Participants may present a panel paper and
participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a seminar.

All who attend the MSA Conference must be members of the organization
with dues paid for 2002.




CALL FOR SEMINAR LEADERS

Deadline: 15 February 2002


SEMINARS

Participation of conferees in seminars is one of the most significant
features of the MSA conference. Seminars are small-group discussion
sessions for which participants write brief "position papers" that
are read and circulated prior to the conference. Seminars generate
lively and valuable exchange during the conference and in some cases
have created a network of scholars who have continued to work
together. Further, the seminar model allows most conferees to seek
financial support from their institutions as they educate themselves
and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.

SEMINAR TOPICS

There are no limits on topics. Past experience has shown that the
more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the
leader, the more useful the discussion has been to people's
individual projects. Seminar topics at the 2001 MSA conference
included "Literary Modernism and Visual Culture," "Modernism and
Masculinity," and "New Approaches to Little Magazines." For a full
listing, see the MSA Web site.

PROPOSING A SEMINAR

Seminar proposals must include the following information. Please
assist us by sending this information in exactly the order given
here. Use as a subject line: MSA 4 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
SEMINAR LEADER].

* The seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address,
phone, fax, and e-mail address
* A brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic
* A current curriculum vitae for the seminar leader

Send seminar proposals by 15 Febrary  2002 to: Elizabeth Evans,
efevans@facstaff.wisc.edu.
Email submission is strongly preferred.

For more information, visit our website:
http://www.press.jhu.edu/associations/msa. Questions not addressed on
the website may be directed to David Chinitz, msa-seminars@luc.edu,
or Douglas Mao, dmao@fas.harvard.edu.

Seminars will be selected in late March. Please note that
participants may not present a paper and lead a seminar at the same
conference. Participants may present a panel paper and participate in
a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a seminar.

LEADING A SEMINAR

The MSA will advertise seminars and register participants. To promote
discussion, the size of seminars is limited to a maximum of 15.
Leaders may, at their option, invite one or two individuals to join
the seminar in some special role. Some leaders will wish to share the
work of reading and responding to papers with the invited
participants; others will simply want to assure a high standard of
discussion by involving scholars whose work they know to be important
for their topic. Please note that invited participants will not be
specially listed as such in the conference program.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to
seminar leaders in May. At that time, leaders should

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and
providing addresses to all participants.
* Set guidelines for the seminar. These might include questions to be
addressed, reading  to be done, and a specified length for the
position papers (normally 5-7 pages).
* Set firm deadlines, no later than mid-September for the actual
exchange of papers.
* Exchange and read papers during the 6-8 weeks before the conference.
* Plan the seminar format. The MSA will provide guidance, but leaders
are, within reasonable limits, free to use the time (two hours) as
they see fit.



CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS

Deadline: 1 May 2002

Proposals for panels must include the following information. Please
assist us by sending this information in exactly the order given
here. Use as a subject line: MSA 4 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
PANEL ORGANIZER].


* Session title
* Session Organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address,
phone, fax, and e-mail address
* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or department,
and contact information
(If you cannot identify a moderator, we will locate one for you.)
*Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,
disciplines or departments, and contact information
*  A 250-word abstract of the panel as a whole.


MSA policy on panels:

1. No participant may present more than one paper at one conference,
and no participant may both present a paper and lead one of the
conference's seminars.
2. We do not accept proposals for individual papers.
3. We encourage interdisciplinary panels, and discourage panels on
single authors.
4. We encourage panels with three participants. Panels of four and
roundtables of five or six
will be considered.
5.  Panels composed entirely of graduate students or of participants
from a single institution are
not likely to be accepted.
6. All MSA panels must have a chair who is not giving a paper. Please
attempt to locate a moderator, but if you do not have one, we will
locate one for you.

Send panel proposals by 1 May  2002 to: Elizabeth Evans,
efevans@facstaff.wisc.edu.
Email submission is strongly preferred. We will accept those sent by
other means when access to e-mail is unavailable.

the website may be directed to Jesse Matz, matzj @kenyon.edu or

I, too, saw the announcement about Stepanek and how he'll be going on Oprah,
fulfilling one of his life dreams (of a life that may be ended early because
of his illness).

Well here's the level of his material as taken from the VSP site:

9-11-2001
It was a dark day in America.
There was no amazing grace.
Freedom did not ring.
Tragedy attacked sky-high.
Fiery terror reigned.
Structures collapsed.
Red with blood, white with ash,
And out-of-the-sky blue.
As children trust elders,
Citizens find faith in leaders.
But they were all blinded,
Shocked by the blasts.
Undefiable outrage.
Undeniable outpouring
Of support, even prayer,
Or at least, moments of silence.
Church and State
Could not be separated.
A horrific blasting of events
With too few happy endings.
Can the children sleep
Safely in their beds tonight?
Can the citizens ever rest
Assured of national security again?
God, please, bless America...
And the rest of our earthly home.

Mattie Stepanek
Sept. 11, 2001

Fiery terror does reign as Stepanek joins the fine poetic tradition of Jimmy
Stewart, Jimmy Carter, Ali Sheedy and Jewel.  (Or I am being too Jonathan
Franzen here. . .)

>Lorenzo Thomas is a widely published poet and critic whose works have
>appeared in many journals including African American Review, Living Blues,
>Partisan Review, and Ploughshares. His poetry books include Chances Are Few
>and The Bathers, and Sound Science; he also edited the Teachers & Writers

>
>------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Daniel Kane interviews the poet Lorenzo Thomas
>
>DK: An "avant-garde" anthology like Rothenberg and Joris's Poems For the
>Millennium is interesting in that it includes blues lyrics by Ma Rainey in
>the same company as excerpts from Gertrude Stein's "Tender Buttons." Is=
 this
>kind of historical thinking and connective work useful for you as a=
 teacher?
>LT: I certainly understand and appreciate why Rothenberg and Joris's Poems
>for the Millennium has to include both Ma Rainey and Gertrude Stein.
>Certainly, listening to Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith might help one to
>appreciate Stein's " Melanctha." Or maybe not.
>
>DK: Say you want to teach Stein's "Tender Buttons" on its own to a group of
>students for whom poetry - all poetry - is a mystery. How might you discuss
>something like "a white hunter is nearly crazy" without driving them and
>yourself crazy?
>LT: Uh huh. Tender Buttons is a crazy book and the white hunter text calls=
 to
>mind the somewhat offensive saying about mad dogs & Englishmen-but then it
>was Gertrude Stein's little friend Ernest Hemingway who actually grew up to
>be a great white hunter. What's great about Tender Buttons (1914) is its
>incomprehensibility, its innovative abstraction. The early fans of the book
>included Kay Boyle and Bob Brown. I think that Brown, in particular, was a
>true believer in the idea behind Tender Buttons. He is now completely
>forgotten, but in 1932 Brown wrote an article titled "Optical Balloon=
 Juice"
>in a little magazine called Contempo where he declared, "I'm not really
>interested in writing either prose or poetry. All I want is words. Words=
 with
>the punch of hieroglyphics, words with the sweep and color of painters'
>lines, twenty-mule-team vigorous vulgar words with a hee-haw kick to them."
>
>Now, how in the heck did he predict TV shows of the 1950s and 60s way back
>then?
>
>Anyway, silliness aside, Brown pointed out that he was interested in the
>overlooked metaphors of everyday speech: "Alley apples for bricks. Human=
 hobo
>slang. Alligator bait for fried liver. Inelegant but elevating." Thankfully
>he didn't include the phrase we used for chipped beef breakfasts when I was
>in the Navy-that one was hardly elevating. But his other examples are
>interesting: "Thieves jargon, criminal cant. Dangler for exhibitionist.
>Lord's Supper for Prison food. Bone-orchard for graveyard. Splinter-belly=
 for
>carpenter."
>You can also imagine how delighted he probably was with the coinages of the
>tabloid newspapers. It may be worth mentioning that, in the late 1920s,=
 Brown
>seems to have pioneered the kind of cartoon/poems that I first came across=
 in
>Kenneth Patchen's work.
>
>Someone may say that Bob Brown's idea actually leads away from Stein; that
>hers is an individual, indeed solitary, project while the creative
>development of slang is collective communication. To me, that's OK.=
 Exploring
>the distinction is itself a profitable inquiry.
>
>
>DK: Might Brown and Stein help emphasize the possibilities for language as
>plastic material - stuff you can play with apart from "making sense"?
>LT: Attentiveness to language itself, to words, is the first skill demanded
>of both poets and careful readers. Much too often by the time students=
 reach
>high school or college they have been taught to read for the purpose of
>extracting "content"-or specific bits of information. Standardized tests=
 and
>college entrance exams focus on that approach. That kind of reading is like
>panning for gold. It is certainly not the best way to read either poetry or
>fiction; and, more importantly, that is not the correct model for listening
>to music or to the pronouncements of our politicians.
>
>There are three levels of attentiveness. First, there is attention to the
>subject matter of a text or an utterance. Second, attention to the shape of
>the argument or discourse. Finally, there is attention to the entire
>performance. Ideally, a book is the record of a mind at work. The third=
 level
>of attentiveness is focused on examining that aspect of a text.
>
>But to go back and answer your question, I suppose I could teach Tender
>Buttons as if it were a kind of sketch-book. Then it would provide certain
>models for students to analyze or emulate. For example:
>
>*   Creative Writing exercise: Pick an object in your kitchen. DO NOT NAME
>IT. Write about it using only metaphor. In other words, describe it in a=
 way
>that no one has ever before thought of. If the rest of the class can't=
 guess
>what the heck you're talking about, then . . . .
>
>I suppose the instructor can decide whether that deserves an "A" or an "F."
>
>*   Grammar lesson: Better yet, we might think about the list of equations
>offered by Bob Brown:
>
>"Bone-orchard for graveyard," for example. That one rhymes, doesn't it?
>What's the logic involved in the substitution of words, images, or ideas in
>these slang metaphors?
>
>Or, again, what about that line concerning mad dogs and Englishmen? Is it=
 the
>name of a rock album? A signifyin(g) comment by the "natives" about their
>colonial bosses? A bar-room joke told by the layabout colonial bosses in=
 the
>subjunctive, i.e., putting words into the mouths of the Other for their own
>amused self-aggrandizement through ostensibly uncharacteristically honest
>self-deprecation? Do we need to call in Erving Goffman? "If," as Louis
>Armstrong once said, "you have to ask," does that mean your loan=
 application
>will be turned down? Do you get a piece of candy beside your pillow-or a=
 lump
>of coal?
>
>
>DK: Lorenzo, I'm getting a little confused!
>LT: Hey, what am I talking about? You see the baleful influence of Gertrude
>Stein?
>I guess what I am suggesting is that I do not approach teaching Tender
>Buttons by promising to assist students in "deciphering" it or=
 "translating"
>it into ordinary English. It is not a text that makes paraphrase an easy
>task. It may be much more useful to leave students puzzled while=
 collectively
>attempting to see if we can discern Stein's method.
>
>
>DK: By asking your students to move away from experiencing the poem via
>paraphrase - to cease panning for gold, as it were - and towards reading=
 the
>poem as an experience of process, what might the student then "get" from=
 such
>an experience?
>LT: In Sister Brother: Gertrude and Leo Stein (1996), Brenda Wineapple says
>that Tender Buttons shows Gertrude Stein moving "away from the world of
>predictable objects predictably named" (371). As such, Stein's experiments
>can be useful in getting readers to think about how and why certain aspects
>of language work. Do short stories and television commercials follow the
>model of our thoughts or do they train us in ways of thinking? If most of=
 our
>speech and writing follows a handful of phrase and sentence patterns, does
>breaking out of those predictable patterns yield pleasure or annoyance?
>
>Recently I had a seminar that read and discussed Jeffery Renard Allen's=
 novel
>Rails Under My Back (2000). The group's initial response was confusion. We
>then looked at Allen's poems in Harbors & Spirits (1999) and noted how he
>used folkloric themes, allusions, the figures of the Afro-Haitian orishas
>(mythological gods and goddesses). Allen's poem "Backstreets," written in
>1990, gave us a key to the very poetic prose that he employs in the novel.
>Then we were able to consider how the formal structure of the novel differs
>from the structures of his poems. At some point, I think, someone will
>carefully compare the structure-as well as the thematic content--of Rails
>Under My Back to Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952) and Jean Toomer's=
 Cane
>(1923). But the first real problem -with Rails or any other=
 self-consciously
>innovative, nonlinear, or avant-garde text-is to find a place to enter;=
 what
>I'd like to call "a familiar door into the unknown." Getting out of the=
 maze
>afterward may be beside the point.
>
>
>DK: You're someone who is clearly invested in the avant-garde and has=
 worked
>to delineate a specifically African-American derived notion of prosody
>through your work in the Black Arts movement and your various prose works.
>Have you ever faced any conflict teaching modernist texts including those=
 of
>Pound and Stein (who were not really overt about the influence blues,
>minstrelsy and patois played on their own poetics) alongside more
>specifically political/racially conscious work? How do you make connections
>between, say, the work of Amiri Baraka and Charles Olson?
>LT: The entire issue of language dialects fascinates me. There is a=
 tendency
>to think that education and media have begun to threaten the existence of
>regional dialects in the United States. But even if that is true, there is
>still the fascinating world of fashionable dialects-manners of speech that
>are adopted because the speakers think that it makes them "cool" or
>impressive or what have you. I have found it interesting to monitor how
>Hip-hop has run through the regional African American dialects of Hollis,=
 New
>York to Compton, California to New Orleans to Atlanta. The fans seem to
>imitate whichever rhythm is a hit for about six months and then switch to=
 the
>next one. I began to look at that when the question of whether or not there
>is a standard African American vernacular was raised. And I suppose that=
 one
>could say that there is indeed such a thing; but that it depends upon=
 fluency
>in all of these regional variations. Still, of course, there is no
>impermeable barrier between the vernacular of African Americans and that of
>other Americans.
>
>An essay in the current issue of Antioch Review points out that when Jack
>Kerouac and his colleagues set out to capture the rhythms of Black speech=
 and
>hipness in their writing, they didn't bother to spend any time reading the
>work of Black writers. Similarly, Ezra Pound seemed to have been familiar
>with a number of American dialects but he used what he knew, particularly=
 in
>his letters, to achieve a sort of minstrelsy. Then, of course, there is=
 John
>Berryman who used his own version of minstrel dialect  in some of his later
>poems. I guess you could say that anything a poet hears can go into the=
 poem.
>That's legitimate. But it is up to the reader or auditor to determine the p
>urpose of such detours into other voices..
>
>There is also the question of the value that can be attached to a=
 particular
>manner of speech. Discussing the Haitian surrealist poet Clement
>Magloire-Saint-Aud=E9 (1912-1971), critic Michael Richardson can assert=
 that
>this poetry represents "the contamination of the French language by the
>introduction of a Creole sensibility" (28). Of course, Richardson's=
 statement
>would have pleased rather than offended Magloire-Saint-Aud=E9, a man who
>reportedly preferred the company of laborers over the literati.
>
>Magloire-Saint-Aud=E9 proudly claimed that his poems represented "defiance=
 and
>distrust" of what he called "illusory philosophies" and "unctuous and
>sonorous morals" (236). I suppose that because there is an academy in Paris
>in charge of the French language, it is possible to contaminate it.
>
>Since Emerson's nationalistic essay "The Poet" (1844), however, a word like
>"contamination" could not possibly be applied to the language (or dialect
>choice) of any anglophone American poet-black, white, or brown-except by
>someone like Prince Charles in his role as defender of a particular sort of
>British English. But when it comes to American poetry, even critics who=
 might
>share that point of view tend to give it a positive spin. In The Dialect of
>Modernism (1994), Michael North presents an excitingly daring and=
 interesting
>argument about how T. S. Eliot and Pound used what they thought of as Negro
>dialect "against the standard language to make way for an entirely new
>literature." In terms of Pound's Pisan Cantos, North argues that Pound
>utilizes the Chinese ideogram and Uncle Remus dialect "to demolish the
>authority of the European languages and even of the Roman alphabet" (99).
>
>Come to think of it, "demolish" may be even stronger than "contaminate."=
 But
>there's another view conerning so-called African American dialect. African
>American poets in the 1960s and 70s were well educated, well read, and also
>quite a bit alienated. We knew-as Toni Morrison puts it in Playing in the
>Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992)-that the classics of
>American literature were not written for black people to read (16-17). We
>also loved the lingo of the black community, the everyday language we had
>grown up with-from heavily ironic polemics of the street-corner orator, or
>the fervent prayers of the Church mothers, to the risqu=E9 wit of the
>barbershop raconteur. We knew that this language could be both beautiful=
 and
>eloquent. As a result of these perceptions, the Black Arts poets made it
>their business to (a) write directly for black readers; and (b) employ
>African American vernacular as a literary language.
>
>I do want to make it clear that this aspect of the Black Arts Movement was=
 an
>affirmation, not a reaction. It was not an attempt to demolish the English
>language. One thing I will say about the connections of Modernist ideas to
>current poetic practice is that, while grounded in Pound's ideogrammatic
>method, Charles Olson's "Projective Verse" theory deeply influenced Amiri
>Baraka. It was Baraka's Totem Press that published Olson's essay as a=
 little
>book in 1959. And, through Baraka, the Projective Verse idea was avidly
>adopted by the writers of the Black Arts Movement who saw how it was=
 possible
>to "score" their oral approach on the page. Baraka's statement "How You
>Sound?" in Allen's The New American Poetry 1945-1960 is a key text to
>understanding how that development was set into motion. When Olson says=
 that
>the printed line on the page should represent the poet's breath, then=
 reading
>a properly "scored" poem should allow the person reciting to reproduce the
>poet's oral performance. There is nothing mystical about this really; the
>same rule applies to the sonnet.

Let's say you wrote some "surrealist" and
"innovative" verse - you enter it into a contest
and - lo! and behold! - you WIN!

Ed McMahon shows up at your house with a big fat
prize - publishing houses are calling you - all
the bonuses of the world

Well guess what... YOU ARE MAINSTREAM!!!

Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too
- they want to write verse *outside* the
mainstream of contemporary poetics and at the
same time - recieve all the recognition they feel
it is due

It seems to me if you are really interested in
knowing what the judges prejudices are - you
would look at what won in the past - what the
judges have written and edited - the sort of work
the sponsoring magazine accepts - it would give
you a good rule of thumb

<begin rant here>

i am utterly opposed to contests - if poetry
cannot exist without my entrance fees - then
POETRY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE READ!

fuck the contests - forget them - can you imagine
Whitman entering a contest? i doubt it - put your
time and energy into better things - the standard
MFA Verse is death - the last gasp of an
intelligent brain dying - more constricting than
any of the regular verse forms the modernists
ever attempted to overcome - the wailings of a
grotesque grandiosity of ego - sure some of it is
"good" - so what? fuggedaboutit!

if poetry is going to have a future - it is not
going to be from MFA Students - "precious" poetry
who get up in front of groups of people reading
what is essentially uninteresting even as prose
in that "special voice" that poets use (we all
know that voice) because they think somehow
changing their tone of voice will make a bad poem
good - though these poems are rarely bad, merely
dusty the moment they are written

so say no to contests - donate money to a
magazine if you want to - or better still - send
a check to a poet you happen to like - forget the
institutions - they trap a poet like dragonfly in
honey - keeping relics of byegone eras alive for
ever and ever

CALL FOR SEMINAR AND PANEL PROPOSALS

MSA 4

THE MODERNIST STUDIES ASSOCIATION
FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE

31 October - 3 November, 2002
University of Wisconsin, Madison


The MSA

Founded in 1999, the Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the
study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and
intellectual contexts from the late nineteenth century through the
mid-twentieth. Through its annual conferences and its journal,
Modernism/Modernity, the organization seeks to develop an
international and interdisciplinary forum for exchange among scholars
in this revitalized and rapidly expanding field. For more
information, please see our web site at
<http://www.press.jhu.edu/associations/msa/>

The fourth annual Modernist Studies Association Conference will be
held at the Monona Terrace Convention Center, a building designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright on the shores of Lake Monona in downtown Madison,
Wisconsin. Sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the
conference will feature plenaries, panels, seminars, poetry readings,
and film screenings related to the study of modernism and modernity.

Calls for seminar and panel proposals follow. Please note that the
deadline for seminar proposals is 15 February 2002, the deadline for
panel proposals 1 May 2002. Please note also that MSA rules do not
allow participants to lead a seminar and present a paper for a panel
at the same conference. Participants may present a panel paper and
participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a seminar.

All who attend the MSA Conference must be members of the organization
with dues paid for 2002.




CALL FOR SEMINAR LEADERS

Deadline: 15 February 2002


SEMINARS

Participation of conferees in seminars is one of the most significant
features of the MSA conference. Seminars are small-group discussion
sessions for which participants write brief "position papers" that
are read and circulated prior to the conference. Seminars generate
lively and valuable exchange during the conference and in some cases
have created a network of scholars who have continued to work
together. Further, the seminar model allows most conferees to seek
financial support from their institutions as they educate themselves
and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.

SEMINAR TOPICS

There are no limits on topics. Past experience has shown that the
more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the
leader, the more useful the discussion has been to people's
individual projects. Seminar topics at the 2001 MSA conference
included "Literary Modernism and Visual Culture," "Modernism and
Masculinity," and "New Approaches to Little Magazines." For a full
listing, see the MSA Web site.

PROPOSING A SEMINAR

Seminar proposals must include the following information. Please
assist us by sending this information in exactly the order given
here. Use as a subject line: MSA 4 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
SEMINAR LEADER].

* The seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address,
phone, fax, and e-mail address
* A brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic
* A current curriculum vitae for the seminar leader

Send seminar proposals by 15 Febrary  2002 to: Elizabeth Evans,
efevans@facstaff.wisc.edu.
Email submission is strongly preferred.

For more information, visit our website:
http://www.press.jhu.edu/associations/msa. Questions not addressed on
the website may be directed to David Chinitz, msa-seminars@luc.edu,
or Douglas Mao, dmao@fas.harvard.edu.

Seminars will be selected in late March. Please note that
participants may not present a paper and lead a seminar at the same
conference. Participants may present a panel paper and participate in
a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a seminar.

LEADING A SEMINAR

The MSA will advertise seminars and register participants. To promote
discussion, the size of seminars is limited to a maximum of 15.
Leaders may, at their option, invite one or two individuals to join
the seminar in some special role. Some leaders will wish to share the
work of reading and responding to papers with the invited
participants; others will simply want to assure a high standard of
discussion by involving scholars whose work they know to be important
for their topic. Please note that invited participants will not be
specially listed as such in the conference program.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to
seminar leaders in May. At that time, leaders should

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and
providing addresses to all participants.
* Set guidelines for the seminar. These might include questions to be
addressed, reading  to be done, and a specified length for the
position papers (normally 5-7 pages).
* Set firm deadlines, no later than mid-September for the actual
exchange of papers.
* Exchange and read papers during the 6-8 weeks before the conference.
* Plan the seminar format. The MSA will provide guidance, but leaders
are, within reasonable limits, free to use the time (two hours) as
they see fit.



CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS

Deadline: 1 May 2002

Proposals for panels must include the following information. Please
assist us by sending this information in exactly the order given
here. Use as a subject line: MSA 4 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
PANEL ORGANIZER].


* Session title
* Session Organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address,
phone, fax, and e-mail address

and contact information
(If you cannot identify a moderator, we will locate one for you.)
*Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,
disciplines or departments, and contact information
*  A 250-word abstract of the panel as a whole.


MSA policy on panels:

1. No participant may present more than one paper at one conference,
and no participant may both present a paper and lead one of the
conference's seminars.
2. We do not accept proposals for individual papers.
3. We encourage interdisciplinary panels, and discourage panels on
single authors.
4. We encourage panels with three participants. Panels of four and
roundtables of five or six
will be considered.
5.  Panels composed entirely of graduate students or of participants
from a single institution are
not likely to be accepted.
6. All MSA panels must have a chair who is not giving a paper. Please
attempt to locate a moderator, but if you do not have one, we will
locate one for you.

Send panel proposals by 1 May  2002 to: Elizabeth Evans,
efevans@facstaff.wisc.edu.
Email submission is strongly preferred. We will accept those sent by
other means when access to e-mail is unavailable.

        I know the poem about his cat, but spelled Joeffry. I was reading it today.
I also remember he died in debtors prison in 1771.

I am a reader of Smart and am quite taken by his work, particularly and
obviously his poem about Jeffrey his cat.  It is strikingly contemporary
and feline-accurate.  Edward Hirsch has a poem about Smart.

        Exactly. Most will agree that poetry is fine media that we all enjoy it.
Poetry is like my peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and I like it, but its
not for everyone - its for me. Poetry is not for everyone and its not like
bread. Well for Neruda bread is something grand. But most of america has a
loaf of spongy wonder bread in their box. And when its gone they get more.
Bread is everywhere.
I am not calling a for poetry that will make your mouth white and brite or
sell it to give a full head hair to make people like you. No the poetry we
make is appreciated - but how do we get these poems our from under our
shadow of the publishing industry? To gain an audience who would be excited
by poems if placed in a kinder context. I too have had great readings of
poetry with the non poem person. Its been fun. This is why I feel
comfortable in asking why not promote it while compromising nothing.

        Best, Geoffrey

Everyone wants a poem or a song to catch their feelings or ritual on,  to

Academic thought yields a different thrill, and wields some other weapons.

(warning: political)

The statement below (signed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, among
others) speaks for itself. Because I think that the statement deserves
wider distribution that it seems to be receiving, I am forwarding it.

In dharma,

NEWS ABOUT THE NOBEL LAUREATES' STATEMENT BEGINS HERE

OSLO, Norway-December 7, 2001 (OTVNewswire)--At the Nobel Peace Prize
Centennial Symposium
here yesterday celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Nobel prize, 100
Nobel laureates have issued a
brief but dire warning of the "profound dangers" facing the world.
Their statement predicts that our
security depends on immediate environmental and social reform.  The
following is the text of their
statement:

THE STATEMENT

The most profound danger to world peace in the coming years will stem
not
from the irrational acts of states or individuals but from the
legitimate
demands of the world's dispossessed. Of these poor and disenfranchised,
the majority live a marginal existence in equatorial climates. Global
warming,
not of their making but originating with the wealthy few, will affect
their
fragile ecologies most. Their situation will be desperate and manifestly
unjust.

It cannot be expected, therefore, that in all cases they will be content
to
await the beneficence of the rich. If then we permit the devastating
power
of modern weaponry to spread through this combustible human landscape,
we
invite a conflagration that can engulf both rich and poor. The only hope
for
the future lies in co-operative international action, legitimized by
democracy.

It is time to turn our backs on the unilateral search for security, in
which
we seek to shelter behind walls. Instead, we must persist in the quest
for
united action to counter both global warming and a weaponized world.

These twin goals will constitute vital components of stability as we
move
toward the wider degree of social justice that alone gives hope of
peace.

Some of the needed legal instruments are already at hand, such as the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Convention on Climate Change, the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
As
concerned citizens, we urge all governments to commit to these goals
that
constitute steps on the way to replacement of war by law.

To survive in the world we have transformed, we must learn to think in a
new
way. As never before, the future of each depends on the good of all.

Poets to hold reading in zoo's baboon enclosure

Seven poets are to hold a reading of their work inside
the baboon enclosure of a zoo in Chile.

They are holding the recital as a form of protest.
They want to imply that apes are more receptive to
poetry than their countrymen.

They will be lowered into the enclosure in a small
cage, specially designed to protect them from possible
attack.

"We will descend into the enclosure on Saturday
morning at around 11 am," one of the poets told
newspaper Las Ultimas Noticias. "For around an hour we
will take it in turns to read our poems, creating a
sort of dialogue with the apes."

They are hopeful the baboons at Santiago's
Metropolitan Zoo will sit quietly and listen to the
poetry - thereby showing they are more interested than
the average Chilean. The spokesman says they will be
asking the public not to throw peanuts at the caged
poets.

"We are reading our poetry to the monkeys because
poets need an audience and it is hard to find people
who want to listen to us," the poet's spokesman said.

The poets include Raul Zurita, who during previous
performances has burned his face with molten iron and
ammonia and publicly masturbated.

Vet Maricarmen Barba said she was surprised the zoo
authorities were allowing the reading to go ahead.

"These monkeys like biting and are aggressively
territorial," she said. "I wouldn't get in there with
them because they are extremely unpredictable. They
could easily kill someone."

each walmart greeter should read a poem to her/his customer as they come
through the door and get their carts.  maybe a broadside poem on the cart
as well or in place of the greeting reading.  by the way, sorry, sorry that

Damn you guys are cynical. Give the kid a break.

Besides that poem's way better than anything I ever
read by Jimmy Stewary or Jimmy Carter or Jewel. (Sorry
I never read Allie Sheedy).

On Wednesday night, a celebration in honor of Jerome Rothenberg's 70th=20
birthday was held at the Poetry Project of St. Mark's Church in New York,=20
organized by Ed Friedman, Pierre Joris, Steve Clay, Charley Morrow and=20
myself. Among those who performed were David Antin, Judith Malina & Hannon=
=20
Reznikov, Sten Hanson, Alison Knowles, Carolee Schneemann, Jackson Mac Low=
=20
and Anne Tardos, Nicole Peyrafitte, and Robert Kelly. In addition a clip=20
was shown from Eleanor Antin's film, "The Man Without a World," with=20
Rothenberg as dancing exorcist. The night ended with a reading/performance=
=20
by Jerome Rothenberg.

I had the pleasure of introducing Jerry.

Charles Bernstein

**************************************************************

Today we come together to celebrate the life and work of one of the=20
grandest, most animating sprits in the recent history of American poetry.=20
Born on December 11, 1931, to a Yiddish-speaking family, educated at the=20
City College of New York, professor at SUNY-Binghampton and UCSD, Jerome=20
Rothenberg=92s work spans poetry and poetics, translation and editing,=20
performance and activism, to each of which he continues to bring an=20
unbridled exuberance and an innovator=92s insistence of transforming the=20
given state of affairs.

How then, in a few words, can we touch on the full range of Rothenberg=92s=
=20
poetic project?

In 1979 Rothenberg wrote: "My passion is to maintain and shore up what=20
comes to us as a larger human memory, and to preserve as far as possible --=
=20
and not in a museum sense--the real, continuous and localized cultures, the=
=20
diversity that still exists in the world: to thwart by all means possible=20
the other process toward homogenization of cultures into a single=20
monoculture."

In the late 60s and early 70s, with his ground-breaking anthologies=20
Technicians of the Sacred and Shaking the Pumpkin,  as well as America: A=20
Prophesy (coedited with Georuge Quasha), Rothenberg  insisted on the=20
immediate (rather than simply historical or anthropological) relevance of=20
the "tribal" poetries of Native Americans (on both American continents),=20
Africans, peoples of Oceania.  This was a concerted assault on the primacy=
=20
of Western high culture and an active attempt to find in other,=20
non-Western/non-Oriental cultures, what seemed missing from our=20
own.  Moreover, the "recovery" of Native American culture by a Jewish=20
Bronx-born first generation poet-as-anthologist (in Rothenberg's words --=20
"a jew among / the indians") whose aesthetic roots were in the European=20
avant-garde implicitly acknowledges our domestic genocide.  This gesture=20
cannot be fully appreciated without recognizing that it functions as a way=
=20
of recovering from the Second War by refusing to cover over the genocide=20
that has allowed a false unity to the idea of American=20
Literature.  Rothenberg's anthologies present a polycultural America of=20
many voices in a way that explicitly rejects Eurosupremacism from within a=
=20
European perspective -- that is, dispensing with the demagogic rejection of=
=20
Europe as such in favor of idealized "America".

Here's Rothenberg in Shaking the Pumkin, anticipating what is now a central=
=20
tenant for our multicultural poetics: "For a period of twenty-five years,=20
say, or as long as it takes a new generation to discover where it lives,=20
take the Greek epics out of the undergraduate curricula. & replace them=20
with the great American epics.  Study the Popul Vuh where you now study=20
Homer, and study Homer where you now study the Popul Vuh -- as exotic=20
anthropology, etc."

I want especially to note how much this proposition has actually come to=20
pass, much to chagrin of many keepers of that older permiflame that refuses=
=20
to go out because it was never lit.

As Rothenberg writes in one of his poems

         "but the ACADEMY OF DADA
knows not the least green vales of England nor knows cathedral bells
ding dong it is the first academy without a book ...

Dada knows not but knows each is his own Dada

I can't believe that two people accused me of writing-to-order (as if tat
were necessarily bad--I've done some freelancing and the deal is that you
write what they want...).  But anyway, I said I could have "put together" a
submission of poems that were more in the judges' style.  I didn't say
anything about _writinfg_ more poems in their style.  It was just a matter
of _selecting_ poems from among the poems ai have already written that would
be more to their style.  I sued to write more autobiographica and less
strange poems, and they clearly would have been better if I am to judge from
teh winning chapbook they sent. The only thing is that the contest is judged
by a different person each year, so the chapbook they sent might not
represent what they chose this year.

I don't understand the self-righteousness of the responses to my post.
Doesn't everyone _always_ choose to submit poems to a publication in which
the poem would fit in stylistically?  Don't you look at journals before
submitting? My problem with the contest was that you could not really look
to see what they  want.  And as I said above, I wouldn'ty have written
specifucally for that contest.  But I don't see anything shameful about
writing a poem that fits an editor's taste!

Wow! You can do that? Write poetry like that? Made-to-order. Wow.

Richard, I suppose I allowed for that, however indirectly, with Scripts for
the Pageant.
Merrill rattles among late Modernists even as he writes into the seventies,
which is fine, except that I prefer the first stringers.  It's a matter of
taste, of course.  Merrill reads to me as a poet who is most concerned with
mastering and manipulating  devices -- a craftsman in the main.  Nothing
wrong with that, I guess.  But for me, at least, the work lacks a sense of
adventure, of exposure, even in its most experimental bee bops which just
never seemed all that fresh to me.  Mannered, yes.  And yes, I am more
concerned with the abuse of power than I am with inherited privilege, though
I'm not delighted with the latter.  Ass kissing is another matter altogether.
 If a certain amount of hyporcrisy is to be forgiven in matters re:
publishing, then we must be consistent when it comes to  the self-serving
behavior of governments on the world stage where much more is at stake.  No?
Ah, the nature of the human.  Best, Bill

This is somewhat reminiscent of Joseph Beuys' two
masterpieces, "Explaining Pictures to a Dead Hare,"
where he sat in a store showwindow, his feece covered
in gold leaf, a dead rabbit in his arms, talking to
it,--- and the other where he had himself sealed for
days in an art gallery with a live wolf, stacks of the
New York Times, and his tarpaulins of his trademark
felt that he wrapped himself in, with a sort of
shepherd's crook, as I remember it.

Green Integer (in collaboration with O Books) is proud to announce the =
publication of The Disparities by Rodrigo Toscano. The book is available =
to individuals on this list for a 20% discount. The book retails for =
$9.95, which means that with $1.50 postage, you should mail a check to =
Green Integer (6026 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90036) =
for $9.46.

In The Disparities, Rodrigo Toscano's first full-length collection of =
poetry, the author explores "how things wouldn't happen." The =
Disparities brings together official and unofficial histories that vie =
with one another to expose new meanings created between "the gaps." =
Time, in this highly original work of poetry, is "unwound," revealing =
new significance for the things of the world, "not apples and oranges / =
but fruits / off the same carved-up tree."=20
     Rodrigo lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.


_________________

Let me also take this opportunity to announce to the poetic community =
that we
are reprinting My Life by Lyn Hejinian in the Green Integer series. This =
will be the fifth
reprinting of the book, a book which we care very much about, and which =
have been instrumental
in keeping in print and available.=20
     Although we have a few copies of the Sun & Moon edition available, =
the book (for all practical
purposes) is out of stock. But the new edition, reset and corrected, is =
now at the printers, and should be available by the first week of =
February 2002.=20
     I feel a bit frustrated by the statements made regarding My Life on =
the Poetics list. Any time a=20
reader makes a copy of a book for which we have not given permission he =
or she is showing a great disregard for both author and publisher, since =
neither will see any money that would help the writer to survive and =
help the publisher to keep the book (and others) in print. Perhaps, as =
Standard Shaefer has suggested, it might have been more sensible to have =
contacted the publisher (Sun & Moon or Green Integer) than simply =
getting on the list and presenting incorrect information.=20
     I am quite available, and will be happy to answer any questions you =
have about any book we
publish. You can contact me, Douglas Messerli, at =
djmess@greeninteger.com

My best,

I'm also uncomfortable with this making-fun-of,
especially where it involves a person with disability
(where're Thomas Bell and Millie Niss when you need
'em?). Think of Larry Eigner!

There are any number of "great" poets, Plath (?),
Pound, the afore-discussed Hannah Weiner, etc., etc.,
whose work has to be reconciled to/through their
disability.

How is it Nobel Prize material when Samuel Beckett
writes from the ~perspective~ of a legless, armless
trunk in a basket, but despicable when it's from an
actual gimp.

If I were this child's poetry tutor (if he's 11, then
he's a prodigy and you're misjudging the work by adult
standards: it is very atypical writing for an 11-yr.
old), I think I'd highlight the lines

> Fiery terror reigned.
> Structures collapsed.
> Red with blood, white with ash,
> And out-of-the-sky blue.

as moving toward a more "adult"/literary direction,
sort of Nostradamean in their apocalypticality.  He
has a tendency toward unmonitored abstractions,
definitely.  In those lines, he starts to cross over
"better," I'd say, into finding a palpable, visceral,
imagistic grounding where the abstraction can be
experienced more sensorily.

I'm reminded of my archived post about the poet who
wrote "Invictus," a cripple on crutches, valedictorily
invoked by hyper-American patriot  bomber Timothy
McVeigh, at his hour of vulnerability.  There's a
curious symmetry there, nation-to-man: now it's we who
are in bomber patriotic mode, and look how the
national focus has found a parallel cripple poet to
laureate.

In ways, I find the poetry of Jewel or ~The Basketball
Diaries~ a much more disturbing phenomenon because, in
Jewels' case, these writers are ~Aryan~ in their
physical perfection.  Kohut, about Nazi Germany,
theorized a metapsychology of national narcissisms,
where the danger is in the self-image of beautiful,
handsome, invulnerable, gym body, to the exclusion of
the weak and damaged.

And I don't find it a particularly help strategy for
poets to oppose ourselves to ~any~ advancement of
poetry and pit ourselves against every example that
reaches mass audience.  Why do we?  Are we ~envious~
and bitter that they and not we are getting attention?
 A more effective strategy, I think, would be to
~link~ ourselves to every such fluke of poetry
publicity.  If SPD and all the EPC publishers were to
"shower" this guy with avant-garde books, along with
all the other cratefuls of gifts he's gonna be
receiving from all over the coutnryh, and "our"
community editors were to write through his agents to
~solicit~ poems to include in "our" journals, . . .

Recall, too, Lyn Hejinian's and Leslie Scalapino's PIN
(Poets In Need), a fund for poets in times of
emergency, illness, life crisis, or Brendan Lorberer's
similar ~Lungfull~ efforts for (forgive my poor memory
for names) the young poet injured in a car crash in
September.


I apologize that I'm always bringing up my May finger
injury on lists; it's much better, healed,
miraculously; but---

On my first visit to the hand surgeon after the
emergency room, I was in his office waiting for him.
And looking about, snooping, the way one does in MDs'
offices.  And there was one of those calendars of
painting done by disabled people, "mouth paintings,"
as the genre is called, by quadraplegics.

In the past, I'd always found that stuff fiendishly
risible.  "Sappy."  No different from Taiwanese
painting factory work, except maudlinly authored.
America's weakness for such work is, of course, its
own curious phenomenon. (...which could be critiqued
in various directions: Americans, in a "sick" nation,
correctly recognize the work of the most severely
disabled as the best expression of our national
vulnerability/pathology;...)

Anyhow, that afternoon, with my first phlange almost
gone, feeling awful and full of dread, leafing through
the "mouth painting" calendar, it looked different to
me.  Not so laughable.  In fact, some of the paintings
had their own verve.  A lot of them fell short of
"better" work by standing just to the left or right of
a particular imitated tradition,--- but American
painting has always tended toward that (Abstract
Expressionism, Pop, etc., aside), the way we produced
all those "second-rate" Cubists in the '20s-'30s.  The
art's "failure" was more a result of provincialism,
not so much abt. a lack of "inspiration."  Like
klezmers.  When all you've got to blow on is a kazoo
(provincial limitations), it's gonna sound pretty
tinny.  But, if you can screen out the accidentals and
hear through to the "core,"...

I told a friend of mine abt. this embarassing "change
of heart."  He said, "So, as a result of your injury,
you're developing Compassion."

I didn't get to see the original post because of server problems. The kid
writes better than I did when I was eleven, and better than a lot of what
many bookstores stock as poetry. I spent a good part of my life staring down
the Reaper, so I view his situation a bit differently than people who've
never faced a life-threatening illness. If he's going to die, let him have
his spot with Oprah, even though we'd like to have it ourselves. Recognize
the heart and conscience expressed in the poem. With a full, healthy life to
devote to his craft, he might have become a good poet.

Oh, come on, folks.  What I posted was in response to someone else who
posted about contests and now I'm getting flamed and made fun of.

Is your attitude that one shouldn't bother to try and get published because
if the work is good enough, it will be acclaimed by the angels and
disseminated all over the land (perhaps by air-drops like the smushed food
they were dropping in Afghanistan)?  Perhaps if you are relly great you can
wait until people beg you to publish your work, but the rest of us have to
submit to journals and contests and so on if we want our work to see the
light of day.  I think the attitude you have is elitist and just plaini
unkind.

I said stright off that I didn't expect to win.  My only regret was
submitting to a contest and paying the entry fee) that probably wasn't in
line with what I submitted.  The editor at the press involved replied saying
they publish all sorts of stuff, so maybe I was simply wrong to say that I
submitted the wrong poems.  Obviously I didn't subbmit the right poems. The
only question is whether I could have submitted different poems more
successfully.  But it's not a question I care about because it's OVER.

Surely we all make mistakes like this and waste stamps but it is hardly a
major disappointment because one can never _expect_ to win or to get
published; it's a relatively hard market these days with fewer and fewer
journals.  And I guess there is also a reluctance (which I shoud overcome)
to submit to journals which are very small or photocopied etc. If I were
suitably humble I'd submit more to these places and presumably be more
likely to get published.  But I am still young and unhumbled.  I am sure I
will eventually get humbled, which will be good for my character...

Let's say you wrote some "surrealist" and
"innovative" verse - you enter it into a contest
and - lo! and behold! - you WIN!

Ed McMahon shows up at your house with a big fat
prize - publishing houses are calling you - all
the bonuses of the world

Well guess what... YOU ARE MAINSTREAM!!!

Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too
- they want to write verse *outside* the
mainstream of contemporary poetics and at the
same time - recieve all the recognition they feel
it is due

It seems to me if you are really interested in
knowing what the judges prejudices are - you
would look at what won in the past - what the
judges have written and edited - the sort of work
the sponsoring magazine accepts - it would give
you a good rule of thumb

<begin rant here>

i am utterly opposed to contests - if poetry
cannot exist without my entrance fees - then
POETRY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE READ!

fuck the contests - forget them - can you imagine
Whitman entering a contest? i doubt it - put your
time and energy into better things - the standard
MFA Verse is death - the last gasp of an
intelligent brain dying - more constricting than
any of the regular verse forms the modernists
ever attempted to overcome - the wailings of a
grotesque grandiosity of ego - sure some of it is
"good" - so what? fuggedaboutit!

if poetry is going to have a future - it is not
going to be from MFA Students - "precious" poetry
who get up in front of groups of people reading
what is essentially uninteresting even as prose
in that "special voice" that poets use (we all
know that voice) because they think somehow
changing their tone of voice will make a bad poem
good - though these poems are rarely bad, merely
dusty the moment they are written

so say no to contests - donate money to a
magazine if you want to - or better still - send
a check to a poet you happen to like - forget the
institutions - they trap a poet like dragonfly in
honey - keeping relics of byegone eras alive for
ever and ever

Wow! You can do that? Write poetry like that? Made-to-order. Wow.

Maybe I'll start a fast-food-poetry contest, dig.


If you backchannel me, I'd like to personally award you a prize.

Ha Ha!  Funny but unfair.  If I may come to the defense of men2, artists of
all sorts have been creating to order for as long as artists have been
creating.  Michelangelo and Blake spring immediately to mind.  Not to mention
all of those talented songwriters who compose for movies.  "A ballad?  With
simple boy-girl lyrics instead of my usual inscrutable poems?  And it must
relate to the love between an artificial intelligence and an ashtray?  You
got it!"  Artists can do this.  However "inspired" they are some of the time,
they are also craftsman.  At least the best ones are.  Of course men2 can do
this.  You probably can also.  Best, Bill

The long poem that "My cat Jeoffry" comes from is called
JUBILATE AGNO (in praise of the lamb) and is a
proceduralist proto-langpoem if there ever was one -- a
long series of complementary verses contained in a journal,
where the verso lines all begin with "Let" and the recto
with "For". "For I will consider my cat Jeoffry / For he is
a servant of the living God" etc. belongs to a section
which has only "For" verses, and is not an independent unit
except by editorial fiat; the rest of the poem is much more
complex and elusive, i.e. the "Let" verse may or may not
logically connect to the corresponding "For". He has a
wonderful passage (Rimbaudesque) on the meaning of letters
of the alphabet. JUBILATE AGNO was not discovered until the
1930s or 40s -- long before this Smart was classed with the
mystico-insane a la Blake and (later) John Clare, partly
because he did occasionally go nuts (would sometimes
interrupt polite conversation to ask "Why are you not
praying?!") and partly due to the elaborate numerical games
in ostensibly more traditional verse poems such as "A Song
to David" which no one of Dr. Johnson's generation could
make sense of. Had they known JUBILATE AGNO I'd guess they
might have thrown away the key -- but it was received with
fascination, not dismissal, when finally discovered. Which
is NOT to say that sufficient studies of him exist -- in
fact a good thorough treatment of his experimentalism (and
not just in free verse) is overdue.

Best wishes,
Damian Rollison

Just to pipe in in defense of Pavement Saw's  contests: as a past "loser", I
really appreciate getting the winning book. It's like a poetry grab bag --
send in your fee (it seems a reasonable fee) & you will get poetry one way
or another. As I recall, the name of the judge was given in advance also, at
least for one of them.
It's hard not to be the one lauded and published, but when anyone is reading
manuscripts and publishing poetry they find exciting, we are all winning.
Best,
Laura

A news announcement that this week _Digital Poetics_ came out from the
Univ. of Alabama Press.

After years in its making and production, it is truly great to finally see
the book in print! I am grateful to the press for the admirable job it did
on this project. I'm quite pleased with how the book came out!

I think many readers on this list will like the book: there is a lot of
discussion about writers, poets, and digital artists that are close to our
interests. One of its goals is marking out a vision of the strands that
link innovative print poetry and digital visual textual experimentation.
This ground, familiar to many of us, is covered and re-cast in an effort to
bring a particularly poetry-based illumination to the new digital
landscape. In addition, the book documents some of the events where we have
witnessed the growth of this new field of poetry. So I'm sure many will
find it interesting!

If you haven't seen info about the book, there is a link to DP info at the
EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu/). Order information is available at Alabama's
DP page (http://www.uapress.ua.edu/authors/Glazie01.html). Here's hoping
you will have the time to check it out!

I also received an email that I had to delete from Noriko Shimoda. It was
headed w/ something referencing Yasusada. So the header is varied. I then
attempted to reply and the mail was undeliverable, to a Yahoo account.  I
would be careful with anything related to Noriko Shimoda. At least not for

I agree he's gifted -- advanced for his age ("for his age," whatever that
means) --
but the POEM IS TERRIBLE, and any literate intelligent kid can (along with
many many adults), with effort, slap together a heap of a cliches...and
that's what this poem is.

I am reminded of many persons who refer to this store as "Tarjay," as
though it were a French name. I suppose in part this is because
Target is on a borderline between middle and lower class. So that
persons of the middle class deal with the unease this causes them, by
guying their own slumming with a gesture of inverse snobbery.  This
playfulness with language, at the service of a social dilemma, has
something of the poetic to it, though I admit it's pretty thin.

But how is it that his work holds, or held, two professorships without

I understand Douglas Messerli's frustration, but I would like to say that I
was seeking, and Poetics folk were sending me, information on where to *buy*
_My Life_, not simply to copy it (and thereby deprive the poet and the
publisher from deserved monies.) But teachers get frustrated too; I've heard
from several people who wanted to teach *My Life* but couldn't because it
was unavailable. At these moments even the most judicious
poet/critic/teacher thinks momentarily of xeroxing sections of the book.
However, the interest in teaching the text and finding copies of it shows
great respect for both Lyn Hejinian and Sun & Moon's work. (And I just got
the phone number and planned to call Sun & Moon directly on Monday as
Standard suggested.) But here's a thanks to Douglas for all his work. I know
publishing is a damned hard, expensive proposition, and Sun & Moon is an
invaluable resource. And thanks to everyone who contacted me to direct me
where to look after I struck out at the bookstores here and SPD.
Thanks very much,
Kathy Lou Schultz

Bill. Hypocrisy like justice: I mean  the abolition of the first and the
"great" promotion of the latter, probably so far off, if not impossible: if
even desirable... As to the world stage I see a lot of complexities and
contradictions and these are in us all: lately S11 whoever or howevr
acheived or "executed" raises many many questions. One "good" thing might be
that such as Merrill might feel less smug....but I digress.... I still feel
that Merrill was a genius: but indeed he lived in a different world. But
then dont we all? All in our own worlds. (Which is why I wish that the US
had left the Taleban alone: they were unique in their own way: there was a
stable government: now you have potentially a greater chaos, and the
potential for even more extreme groups forming is even more possible -even
might be desirable to challenge the arrogant military-political might of the
US).....But to return to Merrill: there was some great "music and deep
meaning" in his poetry: as much as in Ashbery, or Robert Kelly, or Alice
Notley, or hundreds of other marvelous poets of his own time but clearly he
didnt move innnovatively even as much as Berryman or Ashbery (say of Tennis
Court Oath) or even Lowell.....but he is still a major and a significant
poet.
    Forgiving politicians is a hard one!  They are the ones we love to hate.
Cheers, Richard.

I Reply:

I'd rather not have a spot with Oprah. She would undoubtedly ask a
question that I'd find insufferable and her loyal audience would boo
me. Alas.

As for the 11 year old? Many die horrible deaths before their time, and
any comfort we can give speaks well of us. But, what makes me
nervous (for the sake of art), is when people act like that 9/11 poem
that was posted to this list is, somehow, good poetry. (I suppose
someone will make this poem into a broadside and sell it at Wal-Mart,
complete with author bio underneath? And many will buy it as the
sole poem in their collection?)

btw: I've seen more interesting poems from children in the hand full of
times I've worked with them. I've also seen worse, as well. (Most
things from children bear some stamp of an adult "helper" . . . usually
there's a teacher or guardian in the wings . . . [though I don't know if
this is the case here])

And looking about, snooping, the way one does in MDs'

painting done by disabled people, "mouth paintings,"
as the genre is called, by quadraplegics.

In the past, I'd always found that stuff fiendishly
risible.  "Sappy."  No different from Taiwanese
painting factory work, except maudlinly authored.
America's weakness for such work is, of course, its
own curious phenomenon. (...which could be critiqued
in various directions: Americans, in a "sick" nation,
correctly recognize the work of the most severely
disabled as the best expression of our national
vulnerability/pathology;...)

Anyhow, that afternoon, with my first phlange almost
gone, feeling awful and full of dread, leafing through
the "mouth painting" calendar, it looked different to
me.  Not so laughable.  In fact, some of the paintings
had their own verve.  A lot of them fell short of
"better" work by standing just to the left or right of
a particular imitated tradition,--- but American
painting has always tended toward that (Abstract
Expressionism, Pop, etc., aside), the way we produced
all those "second-rate" Cubists in the '20s-'30s.  The
art's "failure" was more a result of provincialism,
not so much abt. a lack of "inspiration."  Like
klezmers.  When all you've got to blow on is a kazoo
(provincial limitations), it's gonna sound pretty
tinny.  But, if you can screen out the accidentals and
hear through to the "core,"...

accepted is to produce work which is actually good.  When you are thought of
as being somewhat dull or "limited," producing sappy poetry isn't going to
help your group's image.  This shouldn't be the case but it's sadly true
that showing yourself to be just as mediocre as other people does not help
your group.  (Although of course that in itself is proof that you are
"normal," as a group, and would presumably have some talented people but
mostly average people in your group.)

It doesn't help that writing activities proposed to menatlly ill people by
occupational therapists (who know nothing about writing) emphasize
"expressing your feelings" over actually creating someting of value.  (Also,
mentally ill people are sick and tired of talking about their
feelings...when I am in a bad way, what I want is something other than my
feelings to think about, like reading Finnegan's Wake for example, for which
I was accused of not trying to get better when I was in the hospital since I
preferred Joyce to a game of ring toss with a bunch of crazy adults in their
pajamas, some of whom had toilet paper in their hair...)

After taking a number of writing workshops and starting grad school, I
decided to teach writing to mentally ill people by including readings of
"real" poets, including poets who are "difficult" such as the Modernists or
the Language group and several other schools in between.  My first lesson
was (very traditionally, probably because I went to college at a school
which taught required Classics courses) on the Epic, and on how modern poets
use epic material, either as subject matter or as a style to be aware of
when writing long poems involving national myths or heros, etc.  I also gave
them some modern poems to read that used more subtle allusions to the
classical epics.

The result was that the students wrote better (compared to a class I had
taught to similar students in which I was more touchy feely and used fewer
readings and more standard workshop exercises).  They would write poems and
say "I'm trying to write a Beat poem here," or whatever and it seemed as if
the ideas had sunk in.  I don't think imitation is the same thing as having
one's own style but it does force you to write rigorously.  (I mean, writing
in "your own" style isn't great if yur own style is maudlin and full of
cliches.)  I criticized their work "as poetry" and pointed out problems
although I always said "I like the poem" but I'd say things like "the poem
isn't finished/polished yet" if it had problems. There was one student who
was so bad that it hurt to try to be positive about it (she eventually
dropped out but occasionally sends me mail.  She was in a really difficult
personal situation, so I didn't want to be harsh, but she must have gotten
the idea that I liked other people's work better...)  Some others dropped
out.  But the rest (half a dozen) wrote poetry seriously.  Of course several
of them had previous experience writing or had read a lot, so it wasn't liek
starting from scratch.

The interesting thing, from the perspective of designing activities for
people with mental illness, was that a rigorous class was just as good at
prvoding psychological support, if not better, than the "therapeutic"
approach where you praise everything and don't teach any published poets at
all.  Someone wrote me that the class kept him out of the hospital.  Various
people gave each other support  with personal problems on the class
listserv.  My conclusion was that people are happier with (and do better at)
activities which do not treat them as if they were stupid and not just crazy
and that people with mental illness do not need to deal exclusively with
their feelings and get excessive positive feedback.  They are in fact
happier to be treated as if they were not disabled.  I guess the experience
taught me, as in your post, to like mouth paintings but only the good ones.

I later worked in a mental health agency and they had a poetry activity and
published a collection and had an annual poetry reading.  Some of the poems
were quite good.  However, I was (surprisingly because I am often elitist)
very impressed that many of these people (like Johnson's dog which walks on
its hind legs) wrote poetry at all.  These people were mostly formerly
homeless, had never worked, and often had many health problems in addition
to mental illness.  I guess I underestimated people a little bit sometimes
(my job was giving out medication in the morning before they went to the day
prgram and people were pretty groggy in the morning) but I was pretty amazed
at the words they knew and the use of metaphors, etc.  This was a case where
I was willing to accept less than wonderful work as a real achievement.  And
it was clear that one couldn't teach this group Language poetry.  But
ascsomeone who has been ill myself I know that I often can't write at all,
and that I can struggle to find words as so forth.  So I, too, now have an
appreciation for all "mouth painters," not just the amazingly talented
ones...

P.S.  I don't actually like the Confessionals that much except for Robert
Lowell who was arguably only a Confessional in maybe two collections in his
whole career ("Life Studies" and "For the Union Dead") and was a generation
older than Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath, whom he taught at Boston
University.  I think Lowell's best work is in the early period, with the
most successful poem (and most anthologized so I am hardly making an
original judgement) being "The Quaker Graveyard at Nantucket," which is
certainly not a confessional poem.  It seems no one reads Lowell any more
though.  I bought a book by Robert Lowell at a bookstand on the street, and
the guy who sold it to me said just that: "I'll give you a good deal because
no one reads Lowell any more"...

Rob't Pinsky reviews Alan Dugan in NYTBR:

> At the age of 78, Dugan remains a high-wire adept.
> A circus pro above mere flash, he has seen over his
> long career many tons of lion and elephant droppings
> go down the drains. In a period when cautious young
> poets may attend graduate school to learn how to be

> doubt about language, Dugan presents a challenging
> alternative: a lyrical skepticism, rooted in experience,
> that scorns the postmodern safety net.
>

It is refreshing that we finally have, in the annals of poetry, "a lyrical
skepticism, rooted in experience." It's about time. I guess what's so great
about it is that it's rooted in *experience*, not in some flight of fancy.
And also that it's skeptical--for who, having endured experience, would
emerge optimistic? So Dugan at least has that integrity.  Yet also, it's
lyrical; we expect lyricism, and I'd say we deserve it. And finally, it's
scornful--scornful of what? Of what history has brought it: deeper
skepticism, more radical doubt.  In summary, the great thing about Alan
Dugan at 78 is that, having weathered "experience," he's somewhat skeptical.

Millie.  I've been in this dilemma eg I have had some poems published in a
NZ magazine "Poetry New Zealand" but the editor chose poems that were I
thought good enough but maybe not what I would want to see. But I wouldnt
have written them if I didnt feel somewhat positively dispposed toward them!
Other things come in such as practicality. What I did in (1996 I think) was
to use the Poet's Market in an attempt to get into some of the more
'radical' mags and so on. It turned out to be easier to get into one of the
smaller and newer presses, which was then a  mag called PICA: the editor (a
youngish woman I gather) was very keen on what I had sent (some strangish
prose poems) which she published. And I thank both editors. Of course I
couldnt be continually at war with the editors: the only way  "in" would
thus be either to be in some recent equivalent of the Langpo or earlier the
Black Mountain or the New York School (I dont know what 'schooll" here in
NZ) or to publish one's own work.In the former case it often becomes who you
know as we all know.
  I think one has to enter the fray and 'test' one's work against so-called
"Official Verse" (and I would say that Bernstein, Hejinian and others have
done that somewhat): and it would be foolish to turn one's back eg on an
offer by The New Yorker to take a series of poems: or even to become a
columnist. The pay would be good and one could work a bit "clandestinely"
with ones more edgy and radical work. It not a sell-out: that's going too
far. Poets of whatever stamp should go for publication wherever and whenever
they can: but of course as you imply this doesnt mean a complete back down
from a radical or "experimental" approach. Some  times the editors of the
so-called "mainline" mags are more open than so-called marginalised
"radicals" as here in New Zealnd the editor of Poetry New Zealand  (alistair
Paterson) is very very supportive of young and old poets and takes the
trouble to give opiniions and thoughts on EVERY poet. Not so confident that
some of our local "Langpo'ists" are quite so open: I think many of them some
are very talented and reside in Universities but they are I think that
others may be rather frightenned of being "upstaged"..... but this is a
generalisation. The other prolem is that all the so-called marginalised
people start talking and almost writing like each other (they start to revel
in their "outsider" status...(and one who does, Alan Loney has been
published all over New Zeakland by some of the best presses..he's far from
"marginalised", rather he seems to ghave a 'chip" on his shoulder) (which is
not to say that he is not a considerable and very ingenious poet: which [the
perceived  sameness or congruence] didnt quite become a big problem with the
langpos but clearly the Creative writing courses have that tendency (they
need'nt, those attending are individuals) : eg there's one here run here
(N.Z.) by Bill Manhire (at Victoria University in Wellington) who is a
marvellous poet  but the poets and writers who have succeeded from that
course are accused, a bit cruelly, of being clones of Manhire (which
accusatin in its turn sounds like shoulder chippings and sour
grapes).....and somewhat the Auckland University perhaps tends to form
cliques: but I benefited greatly from the courses on poetry there not only
on Modernist or "Post Modernist" writing etc but overall........the answer
is to be aware of the negative and positive asspects: whatever way one goes
its all experience. It takes courage and sometimes passion to ignore the
rules (after you've earnt a fistful of them) and then write whatever gets
into YOUR (meaning ONE"S) head.
  A few thoughts.........I can see what you're saying: competitions are ok
for some and there are more ways than one to kill and skin the poetical cat!
Cheers, Richard.  PS: dont worry about being "flamed' no one ever died by
email!

shameful about writing a poem that fits an editor's
taste!    Millie
-------------------------------------------------------


I may have carried writing-to-order (prete-a-lire) to
the extreme.

I would calculate in the journal's typeface,
character-width per line,... wld. read everything I
cld. get my hands on of the editors/jurors...

(I am not necessarily recommending the below as a
Guide To Being Published, by any means.)

In the first year or two of my "Return to Poetry"
(after a 10-yr. hiatus or "abstinence"), in the rush
of its renewed newness, and the sense of infinite
possibilities,---

being published in journals was a driving
(subsequently failed, starved-into-quiescence) desire
of mine and I approached it indiscriminately.
Although I scrutinized any journal I would submit to,
--- and I also submitted to ill-advisedly many
competitions --- I had some sort of blind spot where,
basically, pretty much anything I read seemed roughly
within my range: I already had in my volumes and
volumes of poetry 3-ring binders, I fancied, something
that fit, or that I could come up with something to
match and would put my nose to it.

That perspective was probably related to innate
(infantile) feelings of omnipotence, that I could do
anything or write in any style.

For a Boston Review competition jurored by Jane Miller
(?), I read all her books, and "imitated" her to the
point of ~taking poems of hers~ and *word-for-word*
re-tracing her grammars, subtituting for each word a
synonym or, in another mood, its antonym, a sort of
anti-poem (anti- like anti-matter), identical in every
pattern except that, black-for-white, night-for-day,
it reversed the original thematically.

Lucie Brock-Broido was juror to a Mississippi journal
contest, a place I would normally never want to
publish and whose writing I didn't like--- but I liked
B-B's ~Master Letters~ and somehow felt compelled to
try to establish a link to her by winning this
competition (although she lives write here in the
neighborhood: going to Mississippi in order to meet
your next-to-neighbor).  The "rush" of poetry
("inspiration") by then was approaching flood-date
levels and, given the competition's 10-pp. limit, I
wrote a 10-pp. long poem.  To make sure it would fit,
I measured out character widths of the journal's
pages, etc., and re-formatting, re-lineating the
10-pp. within a millimeter.  (Oh!  A millimeter!
Unconscious name pun there, Millie!)

When I turned in my process notes to Chain that
accompanied the visual art comic book they were nice
enough to print, my future fiancee Juliana reacted,
"That's the first time anybody has written to spec!"
She'd given me a suggested page limit and I tailored
the volume to those margins.

With the criticism/reviews I've had published,
sometimes soliciting editors are almost ~annoyed~ at
this tendency of mine.  "The 'joke' will be lost on
most people," I was told once: they'd stipulated, say,
a 400-word limit and, you know JJ, bingo! 399.
Whatever.

Etc., etc.

Despite never winning anything or being published in
the target journals, it yielded strange
synchronicities.  With my Jane Miller failures, a few
of them became "movie poems", explicitly drawing
imagery from movies I was then also enthusiastic abt.
watching (simultaneously haven't broken an even longer
"abstinence" of avoiding all cinema and television for
a mortification of, like, twenty years; bought a VCR,
renting, renting): "Twelve Monkeys" was the title of
one, after the film.

The winner Miller chose was the Boston Review issue
with the Tom Hanks poems, where every poem of his was
titled after a Tom Hanks movie.

Somehow, it felt, although I'd been bypassed in a
win-or-nothing competition, I'd accurately intuited
(predicted) Miller's vulnerabilities: movies.

And so on, and so on.

When that phase broke and I eased into less-targeted
writing, stopped sending out and just peacefully wrote
for my hour-and-a-half minimum each night,--- I had
settled into a fruitful perversion homogenized out of
all those previous goals:  I ~counted up~ the number
of lines per page in journals and, either reasoning
that editors prefer one-poem-per-page or myself
disliking the usually arbitrary break page-turning
insets, I came up with an average of 28 lines per
page.  For the next year-and-a-half to two years: 28
lines (including spaces), every night.


Millie, I think that these willingness or capacity to
adapt has to do with some (few) poems writing from an
Other-centered place (vs. a "self"-centered).
Psychologically, there's something very significant
abt. that sort of accommodation to the Other.  (And
can be interpreted in different ways: negatively, it
could seem sycophantish, slavish, chameleon...)  In a
different form, that impulse guided Frank O'Hara's
Personism, that "a poem takes place between two
people, not between two pages."  Even when journals
and competitions can be putted aside, that same
personal orientation may re-manifest: writing
~"about"~ others, writing ~to~ others,...

You're writing.  There's something healthy underlying
that impetus.  It's social.

You're bound to be "accused" of writing-to-order,
given the Little Jack Horner School of Poetry that's
prevalent ("...sat in a corner / Eating his ... pie. /
He stuck in his thumb / And pulled out a plum / And
said: What a good boy am I!").

Hello friends--  Glad to hear I'm not the only disgruntled poet to be a bit
fascinated by the Stepanek phenomenon-- not unlike Jewel's poetry being
published a few years ago, I'm interested more and more by the name of "poetry"
itself, i.e., that part of writing which travels under the literary signifier of
the "poetic."  Immediately, yeah, it's awful, but I think it's important to
remember that this is what "poetry" is for people who don't read a lot-- and I
don't want this to sound elitist as hell, but indeed-- I think it's important
for writers/scholars/etc. to pay attention to how these codes play out-- poetry
is available at a local bookstore and will make you feel better, like watching
Forrest Gump  Good poetry is written by people with unfortunate physical
setbacks like Muscular Dystrophy.  Poetry is also incredibly occasional along
these lines-- a "good" poem should be about "important" things like buildings
falling down and America being emotional in order to combat mystery terrorists.
Good poetry should be less of an aesthetic experience than a blank catharsis.

Not being coherent, I realize, but I don't think this ill sort of "popularity"
should be overlooked-- which is not to say that poets should write to be
accepted by the American public, but it's worth thinking about what kind of
ideologies surrounding the poetic and the idea of "poetry" abound.  Not pretty,
and really pretty disturbing-- the lyric ratcheted into an incredibly false and
and pathetic condition of subservience to "feel-good" monoculture.

And on top of that, as bad as this Jewel-Stepanek stuff is, I'd argue that it's
not a hell of a lot worse than what shows up in the New Yorker-- or a number of
other "poetry" journals.

PS, happy new year to all.

I see the point of Mr. Messerli about unauthorized
copying of texts. Since we have some level of
insitutional power (looking for 19 copies of a text,
for example), our continued use of "My Life" (just as
an example) will help the small publisher keep the
work in print.

Still, there is something a little sexy about scaring
up a copy of a rare or hard to find work--I remember
in 1991 when "House of Incest" by Anais Nin was
*impossible* to find and (I believe) out of stock, if
not out of print. Luckily for me, soon after the movie
"Henry and June" was released Ohio U press re-released
all of her works.

As for me, the book I would "most like to copy
illegally" (such a back-handed honor indeed) is
"Cunning" by Laura Moriarty. The thing is, one could
never do it, because the physical book (paper, type,
ink) is unbelievably beautiful and part of the novel
(I swear on of the five best novels I've ever read)--

--still, if I'm ever in the position to order books
for courses, I hope to use books regularly in order to
contribute to their long, long life.

the book I most want back in print (I understand that
I am about to get my wish) is "Europe of Trusts" by S
Howe.

It's really interesting to think about. I mean: how
many great poems *were* indeed written to specific
situations, or even "commissioned" by occasions and
leaders.

And how these poems resist their intended uses. I'm
still nuts about (in spite of the brilliant article in
"Code of Signals" that Michael Palmer edited--who
wrote that article?) the way the Aenied devolves and
then collapses under its own empire-bearing weight.

It's the same sort of trick when an author is writing
for an audience she *knows*--the example from
classical literature is Murasaki Shikibu, summoned to
court of the empress (according to the new
translator--what's his name? I'm so bad at this--why I
never became an academic)--*because* she was writing
the Genji. So each night she's writing the episode,
*knowing* the scrolls are going to be passed around
and read--and she knew exactly *who* was reading as
well because she was living with most of them in the
palace--

and then maybe the author fights for his integrity
back: Thomas Hardy forces to use the bogus happy
ending for the magizine serial of Return of the Native
yanks it from the book version...though most editions
now include it at the end "after" the "actual" book is
completed.

or Virgil who wanted the Aeneid burned. he could see
its flaws. the emperor mis-read the book and published
it and praised it.

and of course Emily Dickinson's "valentine's day
letter" (1850, I think?) was written for her brother's
friend who wanted something for the college humor
magazine (well maybe it wasn't a humor magazine, but
some kind of magazine--I'm a travesty of scholarship,
i know)...

____________________________________________________________________
TEXTUAL OPERATIONS organized by AS BESSA
CARL SKELTON
Dada Lama Ping Pong: Duet /Séance with bp Nichol
Introduced, and occasionally interrupted, by Warren Niesluchowski
bp Nichol was one of Canadaís most inventive poets. Originally part of
the Four
Horsemen group, Nichol also experimented with concrete poetry, children
literature and collaborated with visual artists. Carl Skelton met bp
Nichol in
1982, at Coach House Press and the two were to collaborate in a project
at
Open Studio, in Toronto. Skelton calls "Dada Lama Ping Pong", "a virtual

collaboration between a visual poet and an artist who talks too much.
"Dada
Lama Ping Pong" is based on a sound poem/homage to Hugo Ball, that
Nichol
recorded in1967. It will combine various aspects of bp Nicholís
extensions of
poetry into the visual and aural fields, and Skelton's promiscuous
practice of
splicing and mangling architectural, narrative, and tactile Image
Implantation
Protocols.
Assistance of the Canadian Consulate General and Cabinet magazine is
gratefully acknowledged.

Nothing against SFSU but my bottom line remains:

If the people running a poetry press don't care enough about poetry and
POETS
to run their press with their own money, if need be, so as not to have to
charge
poets to submit manuscripts or enter contests, they should take up another
hobby.

I would add that poets who don't care enough about poetry publishers at
least occasionally to buy books from them and subscribe to their magazines,
and even send gifts of money to them when able, should take up another
hobby.

I've been meaning for quite a while to comment on Igor's re-edit
and properly establish the Satanovsky/Austin/Grumman Buffalo clique,
but just didn't get around to it till now.  Not much to say, actually.  I
think
the Merrill poem an okay one in the now-standard Iowa Epifikal
Free Verse mode, but I like Igor's chop better--though I wouldn't
call it all that experimental.  My editorial annotations follow:



                My grandmother

must be replaced.
                        Frantic adolescense

*change last two lines to "rust be meplaced rantic adolesc

Fense"

wheeled an old lady
into her mink,

*consider various sizes and varieties of fonts for the above two lines

            but what remains?

Todayâ€™s memo from the Tenantâ€™s Committee?
    The ongoing deterioration?

*replace "oration" with multi-colored blob and mess around with the
rest of the passage with smudges and lining out

perform vector analysis on the rest, reprint the whole thing on a crumpled
piece of paper, then get Santa and Rudolph to make the result
really experimental!

ATM in Lobby

                        “Lobby Girl sits on the fat man’s knee-e,
                          fat man happy as he can be-e.”

He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore
the hips tight with her leg, his genuine and less guilty wealth.
Shampooing her lips, swimming and casting round his eye to delve
with some companions what men began to loosen.

Her vagina clamped down upon his cock, and he sends Eurylochus
to explore, to feel it pulsate to her body, shimmer into a herald of new dreaming.
We think we cannot, so then we must investigate this as she became lost
in the throes of her orgasm. This struck dead their hearts,

The end of this counsel being to persuade his soldiers he had actually
done it with a woman. Those parts which he knew would prove a most,
to them, unpleasing motion, to take his cock with her hands and close
her mouth about the head, and therefore I advise thee to explore.

I now am bound, in purpose, to seek by this device of travel
to slowly tighten on it, sucking it until she had about half of it in her mouth,
to earn by her deep explorings, to satiate him, sucking on it like
a popsicle, eyes glued to mine, savoring my every reaction.

And thoughts of sacred Sparta, up and down the coastline of my straining cock,
of our land, its cultivation of the soil and of the mind, exploring the interior
regions of her mouth, preparing by scientific means problems that will unite
us instead of belaboring those problems which invoke the wonders

of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars,
conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean until finally all
of my cock was buried in her mouth. As we plumb the vastnesses
of space, let us go to the new worlds together. She ground

her face against my stomach ere I could explore its wildernesses.
All forms and substances twisting her head back and forth,
then returning to fucking my cock with her mouth. At Oxford, I found
the liberty and seclusion best fitted for my active and exploring mind.

No safer place than college for a youth whose mind wasn’t going
to take anything too roundly. Nothing in my previous experience had prepared
me for the great daring and venture of sailors on new voyages of discovery.
I could feel my balls swelling, getting ready to expel my fluids.

Reckless, O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me.

Regarding worms, trojans, and viruses in general:

The Poetics List may be discounted safely as a possible source of virus
transmission as we have configured the listserv not to distribute email
attachments and embedded files, which are the almost exclusive means of
email-related virus transmission. Indeed, it is for this reason that we
have made the decision not to distribute even so much as HTML-formatted
messages.

While it is nevertheless highly recommended that subscribers run anti-virus
software on their machines, this is urged as a general precaution and is
not strictly related to your subscription to this listserv. The most
current information on computer viruses may be found in the "security
response" section of Symantec's web site:
<http://securityresponse.symantec.com/>.

Isn't it condescending as hell to cut a poet slack because of hir
handicap? Plath needs no slack cut for her; Sexton got too much; and
little Mattie Stepanek does, indeed, seem to write perfectly dreadful
poems. His whole phenomenon seems to me death-voyeurism-kitsch, on the
same plane as _Love Story_ only without Al Gore. Now, if he were forging
the poems of a nonexistent English monk, I'd be impressed.

Dear Damian Judge,

In case it has not already been suggested, Nate Mackey would be of interest
as well.  Check out his essay  "Sound and Sentiment, Sound and Symbol." in
_The Politics of Poetic Form: Poetry and Public Policy_. Ed. Charles
Bernstein. New York: Roof Books, 1998. 87-118.  See also his _Bedouin
Hornbook_ (Sun and Moon, I think).  I understand Nate also performs his
poetry (or recently did) accompanied by a live jazz ensemble.

Good luck with your work, and apologies for not responding sooner.  I'm
catching up with the last month or so of the list only now.

Dear List,

In a different vein, I wonder if I could prevail on your
collective and individual awarenesses for help with my
dissertation project, which is now at an inaugural stage.
I'm writing about the nexus of
poem/text/notation/music/performance in Modernist poetry,
specifically collaborations between Gertrude Stein and
Virgil Thompson and between Louis and Celia Zukofsky, with
some discussion of musical notation in Gerard Manley
Hopkins' manuscripts, and of jazz and blues in Harlem
Renaissance poetics. I'm also interested in Cage and Mac
Low, but I don't know as much as I'd like to about
contemporary poetic engagements with musical structure and
performance. I'd love to hear, bc or otherwise, answers to
some questions about contemporary practice (however one
might choose to delimit 'contemporary'):

1) What poets have integrated musical notation into poetic
texts?

2) What strike you as the most significant examples of
opera or oratorio libretti, or other 'words for music', by
contemporary poets?

3) What poets are especially interested in incorporating
jazz, blues, modern orchestral, American folk, or other
musics into their work? In a U.S. context especially, are
there contemporary poets whose work is deeply engaged with
music as a model? (I'm thinking of Zukofsky, Bunting,
Langston Hughes as precursors here.)

I ask these questions not to shirk the work myself, but
because there are, to my knowledge, few obvious ways to
research it.

Thanks!

Damian

She was murdered in 1982.

There are some great essays on her work-- in The Dream of The Audience
(Constance Lewallen), everybody's autonomy (Juliana spahr), translation and
subjectivity (Naoki Sakai), the melancholy of race (Anne Anlin Cheng)  and
Trinh T Minh Ha has written on her too.  There is a book of essays on her
work called Writing Self, Writing Nation.

I think her archives are at Berkeley.  It's well worth pursuing her work!

Re "My Life". The information I gave was correct in regard to the =
availability of "My Life" through second hand book dealers i.e via =
ADDALL which has other companies such as Abebooks.com associated with =
it. As to who publishers what and where they are that's for publishers =
and other clever types etc I dont buy new stock mainly because I have =
got that kind of money...I'm not quite on a par with Borders yet...
  But as to copying: when I was at the Auckland University the major =
activity of students seemed to be photocopying. I was watching one =
personage one day copying all the books (then available at the A.U.) of =
John Ashbery and somehow the "counter" on the machine was ADDING the =
cost to his card!!!=20
  Mr Messerli doesnt have to wory: photocopying books is awesomely =
tedious and there is always a sufficient market out there of "rich =
people" who buy books at Borders. I could have a copy of "My Life" and =
I'd be struggling to get US$3.00 for it because in the second hand book =
game most buyers have buggerall (or they pretend to be thus indigent). =
Even if I stole 10,000 copies of each book I ever got I would lose money =
through costs accruuing: probably the cost of shredding unwanted poetry =
especially.
  But the capitalist system -  actuallly just about any market system - =
would crash tommorrow if theft was outlawed !!!!
  I've got a book published called "Red". I wish people would steal it ! =
 At least then I know someone wanted it: or thought they did!  Best for =
Xmas and may the US's efforts in obliterating Afghanistan be =
rewarded...hopefully not in kind though.
  PS. This Messerli character sounds a bit retentive...not one of these =
"goody goody" types I hope?=20

The Haiku worm usually arrives as a HAIKU.EXE file
attached to an e-mail message. The message looks like
it was forwarded from the original recepient with the
subject 'Fw: Compose your own haikus'. The message
body advertises the attached file as a Haiku (oriental
poetry style) generator which it actually is. But
along with Haiku generation routine the file contains
worm code. The message the worm spreads itself with
looks
like that:

 :))
 ----- Original Message -----

>"Old pond...
> a frog leaps in
> water's sound."
>- Matsuo Basho.
>
>DO YOU WANT TO COMPOSE YOUR OWN HAIKUS?
>
>Haiku is a small poetry with oriental metric that
appeared in the XVI century and is being very popular,
mainly in Japan and the USA.
>
>It's done to trascend the limitation imposed by the
usual language and the linear/scientific thinking that
treat the nature and the human being as a machine.
>
>It usually has 3 lines and 17 syllables distributed
in 5, 7 and 5.  It must register or indicate a moment,
sensation, impression or drama of a specific fact of
nature. It's almost like a photo of some specific
moment of nature.
>
>More than inspiration, what you need in order to
compose a real haiku is meditation, effort and
perception.
>
>DO YOU WANT TO COMPOSE YOUR OWN HAIKUS?
>
>Now you can! it is very easy to get started in this
old poetry art. Attached to this e-mail you will find
a copy of a simple haiku generator. It will help you
in order to understand the basics of the metric, rhyme
and subjects which should be used when composing a
real haiku... just check it out! it's freeware and you
can use and spread it as long as you want!

When the worm is run it first installs itself as
HAIKUG.EXE into root Windows directory and modifies
WIN.INI to be run during all further Windows sessions.
After that the worm displays a messagebox with a
randomly generated Haiku:

Example 1 [ABOVE;HEAD]

Example 2 [ABOVE;HEAD]

F-Secure Virus Descriptions

NAME:
     Haiku
ALIAS:
     I-Worm.Haiku,
     W95.Haiku.16384.worm

After system restart the worm gets control, checks if
Internet connection is available and starts to look
for e-mail addresses by scanning DOC, EML, HTM, HTML,
RTF and TXT files. After the suitable e-mail address
is
found, the worm decrypts its internal message text,
connects to a remote SMTP server that allows sending
anonymous e-mail and sends its body MIME-encoded with
the decrypted message to a found e-mail address. Then
the worm displays its copyright messagebox:

>From time to time the worm connects to a free web
hosting provider Xoom and gets a WAV file from one of
user accounts. The worm writes the downloaded file as
C:\HAIKU.WAV, plays it and deletes it afterwards. The
WAV file has a copyright string of Sandman:

0 00 00 (

0 74 20 an, 2-2000 fmt
E 0 00 >  [HAPPY FACE] [HAPPY FACE]v C.
0 04 01 [HAPPY FACE] etc.

The generator of Haiku poetry uses the internal table
of words and endings and creates poetry strictly
according to Haiku style rules. Here are the table's
contents:

 LANGUAGE OF INQUIRY). Howe's work is all about scholarship; Hejinian gives=
 stunning, self-contained readings. Perhaps the relative inability of the a=
cademy to barnacle Stein's texts has contributed to their incredible liveli=
ness, their presentness, the sense that they have somehow managed the jump =
from the early twentieth to the early twenty-first century without sign of =
aging. By the same token, however, it's high time to take Stein's intellect=
ual stature seriously. And that, like it or not, requires scholarship. In a=
 couple of years we're going to have to deal with the fact that she was act=
ually writing a century ago (in 2103, Q.E.D, in 2105-06, THREE LIVES, etc.)=
 and I have a sense that we're going to be wanting a textually sound editio=
n pretty badly. I know I will. I'm saying all this completely self-interest=
edly, to be sure, since my book IRRESISTABLE DICTATION: GERTRUDE STEIN AND =
THE CORRELATIONS OF WRITING AND SCIENCE appeared in your local bookstore a =
couple of months ago. If anyone's interested (and to promote interest) here=
's the jacket copy and the blurbs. I take responsibility for the former but=
 not the latter. The book's 475 pp., which partly accounts for why Stanford=

=09"Before Gertrude Stein became the twentieth century=E2=80=99s preeminent=
 experimental writer, she spent a decade conducting research in both the le=
ading psychological laboratory and the leading medical school in the United=
 States. This book unearths the turn-of-the-century scientific and philosop=
hical worlds in which the young Stein was immersed, demonstrating how her e=
xtensive scientific training continued to exert a profound influence on the=
 development of her extraordinary literary practices.
=09As an undergraduate, Stein worked with the philosopher William James and=
 the psychologist Hugo M=C3=BCnsterberg at the Harvard Psychological Labora=
tory, investigating secondary personalities and automatic writing. Later, a=
t Johns Hopkins Medical School, she was involved in cutting-edge neuroanato=
mical research in the laboratory of Franklin Mall, the leading anatomist an=
d embryologist of the day, and Lewellys Barker, author of the first English=
-language textbook to describe the nervous system from the standpoint of th=
e newly established neuron doctrine. Just as scientists reconceived relatio=
ns among neruons as a function of contact or contiguity, rather than of org=
anic connection, Stein radically reconceptualized language to place equal w=
eight on the conjunctive and disjunctive relations among words.
=09In the course of a broad reevaluation of Stein=E2=80=99s career, the aut=
hor situates this major postromantic thinker in the lineage of poet-scienti=
sts such as Wordsworth, Goethe, and Shelley, as well as in an important lin=
e of speculative thinkers that extends from Ralph Waldo Emerson to William =
James, Alfred North Whitehead, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He also links Stein=
 to a wide range of contemporary figures whose work builds on this intellec=
tual heritage, including the bioaesthetician Susanne Langer, the technoscie=
nce theorist Donna Haraway, and the neuroscientists Francisco Varela, Geral=
d Edelman, and J. Allan Hobson. The two lineages, poetic and speculative, s=
hare the perspective that William James designated =E2=80=98radical empiric=
ism.=E2=80=99
=09A groundbreaking interdisciplinary study, IRRESISTIBLE DICTATION aims bo=
th to explicate Stein=E2=80=99s radically experimental compositions and to =
bring the radical empiricist philosophical tradition into focus through the=
 lens of her writing."

=E2=80=9CIRRESISTIBLE DICTATION is dazzling, original, and wonderful. A maj=
or work about Gertrude Stein and her radical creativity, it also brings tog=
ether literature and science in compelling ways. Steven Meyer writes with l=
ucidity, freshness, and authority, and  I am very glad he has written this =

=E2=80=9CWhat has been missing from the vast body of Gertrude Stein studies=
 is an approach so holistic that it sheds light not only on the literary tr=
adition of which she was a part, but the early neurological and philosophic=
 background that contributed so much to her thought. Along comes Steven Mey=

=E2=80=9CIRRESISTIBLE DICTATION is a fascinating new view of science, liter=

Maybe Merrill wasn't as innovative as Lowell (but I doubt that; Lowell's
only "innovative" poems are his bad late ones), but Merrill had the knack of
getting poems exactly right.  Sometimes it was a minor poem that he was
attempting, but minor or major, it always worked.

I think The Book of Ephraim is quite innovative.  Merrill is one of the few
poets who should be allowed to rhyme.  He has permission :-)  The person who
accused Merrill of being manipulative should reread the Sandover poems.  In
the Book of Ephraim, Merrill tries to mess with fate by influencing who gets
reborn where, and totally screws up.  So I think Merrill was quite
self-aware.

P.S.  Has anybody read Snodgrass's "The Fuehrer Bunker"?  I rather like it,
but there is something quite sick, alomst offensive about it, as it makes
Himmler express himself in abecedarian telegrams, plays with sestina,
villanelle, all sorts of forms but but with this vile, awful subject matter.
Of course the poem is against Hitler, but Snodgrass makes the Nazis human
(well they of course _were_ human, which is a dilemma we often don't want to
face) and we wonder whether it is accceptable to play games of language with
such subject matter...

Bill. Hypocrisy like justice: I mean  the abolition of the first and the
"great" promotion of the latter, probably so far off, if not impossible: if
even desirable... As to the world stage I see a lot of complexities and
contradictions and these are in us all: lately S11 whoever or howevr
acheived or "executed" raises many many questions. One "good" thing might be
that such as Merrill might feel less smug....but I digress.... I still feel
that Merrill was a genius: but indeed he lived in a different world. But
then dont we all? All in our own worlds. (Which is why I wish that the US
had left the Taleban alone: they were unique in their own way: there was a
stable government: now you have potentially a greater chaos, and the
potential for even more extreme groups forming is even more possible -even
might be desirable to challenge the arrogant military-political might of the
US).....But to return to Merrill: there was some great "music and deep
meaning" in his poetry: as much as in Ashbery, or Robert Kelly, or Alice
Notley, or hundreds of other marvelous poets of his own time but clearly he
didnt move innnovatively even as much as Berryman or Ashbery (say of Tennis
Court Oath) or even Lowell.....but he is still a major and a significant
poet.
    Forgiving politicians is a hard one!  They are the ones we love to hate.
Cheers, Richard.

From someone with too much time on his hands, here is a
Oulipian treatment of Stepanek's poem, in the spirit of the
Merrill experiment and, more remotely, "On the Pumice of
Morons." This one has the serpent eating its own tail, the
end of the poem feeding backwards into the beginning, one
word at a time, until the whole thing disappears in the
middle. It's mapped to the word count of the original,
though I screwed that up somewhere (one word off at the
end). Some nice surprises emerge here ("no bless amazing
please, grace").

The poem is, after all, just a little chunk off of the crap
iceberg that is contemporary mass culture, so it doesn't
really bother me in itself, and I certainly don't mean to
be satirizing the poem or making fun of the kid. Just
messing about with the words.

  To the List Folks and other Felons. I think this is a good poem for an 11
year old. There are better and worse - although everyone's concept of that
will vary. It seems to be a sincere response to the attack on the United
States, and whatever one thinks of that and whoever and whyever it was
done - it would be an amazing person of that age to be writing like eg Larry
Eigner or whoever else. Maybe we should look at the positive aspects in art
and literature: ask if the writer is really gaining in his/her own
development and experientially is getting pleasure, excitement, fulfilment,
from their writing. I dont mean that ironically (altho of course there's a
place for irony).
  Can we even make judgements: what is "great" literature? Should we even
bother writing great poems? What about just putting it onto paper: throw
away the idea of revisions, the struggle for perfection and so on? Its good
or better (or is it?) that people (young people especially -but no, anyone)
are encouraged....ok they will soon enough get blitzed by zealous or
righteous critics. One of the problems is the very sincerity (or perceived
sincerity) and the realively uncritical way that people "ooh" and "aah".....
if we think of Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade" which in many senses
is a brilliant poem we also know that (even at the time it was known) it was
based on simplistic nationalism and the infamous charge was based on the
misinterpretation of an order given. But if it had been the fact that that
charge was an event that DID save England we could understand the British
being rightly proud of Tennyson (the author of very good poems such as
"Ulysees" and others)...or a cripple if a cripple had written it or
whoever... this however is the "danger" of this kind of writing that we
forget that the person writing is using a "weapon", language, which we know
is very loaded, never innocent, never unmediated.
 There are big questions here (and always) about "language practice" ... it
may not be appropriate just now to present such arguments to this writer or
onto Oprah Winfrey - maybe it should be though or or maybe it is.....
  Rather than a negative good/bad repsonse we maybe should present these
aspects to the writer or each other or whoever as points of discussion...
  Ok  I'm well aware that I am the one who put the boot into Rod McKuen
...but he's a big lad!  And I am sure he would completely ignore me anyway:
point is we are not attacking the person's integrity when we critique a poem
(if we feel it IS neccessary) but asking questions about language forms and
practice, politics into poetry and philosophy and so on.
  One issue of "Fence" I got hold of here had some marvellous poems by
children. One good side: we need to encourage people away from hate and
repressed and negative anger and toward a positive outlook - note that I
said encourage not BOMB......
  This all might sound a bit Waldorfy or Marty (I dont know the place) but
over here (Auckland there's a K'Mart) but probably Waldmart is a change from
Macy's (I actually visited there in 1993 and I was very impresssed by the
revolving doors.....)
  Probably we dont need to put the boot into this boy but be wary of
sentiment and so on.
  Over here there's a lot of crap about Peter Blake ( the round the world
yachtsman) (who was shot on  the Amazon) but I never met the man and cant
somehow get much interest in that fact....I could understand someone in NY
being deeply affected by S11 but not a New Zealander by the death of someone
they'd mostly never met ... and its dubious that he was more important than
I am....in fact he never was: but there's a mass hysteria of the sort that
accompanied the death of Princess Diana. Rather pathetic. I was sadder about
the death of Alan Curnow the poet...but great as he was I didnt feel the
need to go into deep mourning...I can understand the immediate families of
these people feeling very strongly of course...
  What I'm leading into I suppose is the point that in cases like this
people will hit one with the guilt thing: "how could you criticise a
cripppled poet?"  "a dying poet, just a boy?"..well you can and may do just
as you (one) can choose to not respond or whatever. But your response, our
response, shouldnt be based on a feeling of guilt or false sentiment, or
envy or whatever...probably its harmless this phenomena of the "new"
poet.....but if one just HAS to put the boot in....well, as Dietrich said
after a long "lecture" to Wojahoitz on "Barnery Miller" about the moral
problems of violence and cops with guns and life and death, about a recent
"stake out", and to Wojahoitz's question: "Well, what did you do?", then
responded:  "Well, it was him or me, so I blew the bastard away!"
  Some thoughts from abroad. But not from Browning or Tennyson. Regards,
Richard.

That is marvellous, that thing by Thomas: we used to play it on
Christmas...that's an idea: I'll be sat here in me house alone in Auckland
and I can get emotional hearing that again. That's what I'll do on Christmas
day: I'll listen to that recording of Dylan reading (cant take more than one
day of him though) but it is wonderful. Makes me wish it snowed here in
Auckland at Xmas but its just now muggy and the Pohutukawa trees are blazing
with their red jewels ...Alan Curnow has  a great poem about the Pohutukawa
tree...and they are wonderful trees...in fact I believe he was a friend of
Dylan Thomas: some influence, or residue thereof, is in his work...although
I know he had a very wide knowledge of poetry...Browning, and also such as
Wallace Stevens were other favourites I believe. Regards, Richard.

In the world of sitcoms, writers sometimes say of a line "it makes noises
like a joke."  Well 11 or not and sick or not his writing only makes noises
like a poem.  When you bring him onto Oprah -- because isn't it sad and she
likes sad -- and you call him a poet and call his stuff poetry, well, dammit,
it makes my life more difficult.  Now I have to explain to the cousins at
every family reunion why I don't write like this kid -- because, of course,
he's a poet, he has to be a poet, Oprah had him on her show.  If I were a

Regardless of the review's vapid pleasantries, Dugan's always been an
interesting case -- his use of the line at first glance borders on prose,
one of the softest linebreaks in the past 50 years or so (softer even than
Jimmy Schuyler). His poems have always struck me as having their limits, or
at least there is that side of a generation now in its it 80s that was
influenced visibly by Williams but not interested in either the Objectivists
nor the New Americans (Harvey Shapiro & David Ignatow would be two others
and one could jerry-rig Archie Ammons or even Bill Bronk into the same
category I suppose). There's a crabbed rigor in Dugan's best work that lacks
the discipline or formal imagination of a Niedecker, for example, but is
clearly working hard to some good effect.

Ron

"It is refreshing that we finally have, in the annals of poetry, "a lyrical
skepticism, rooted in experience." It's about time. I guess what's so great
about it is that it's rooted in *experience*, not in some flight of
fancy.And also that it's skeptical--for who, having endured experience,
would emerge optimistic? So Dugan at least has that integrity.  Yet also,
it's lyrical; we expect lyricism, and I'd say we deserve it. And finally,
it's scornful--scornful of what? Of what history has brought it: deeper
skepticism, more radical doubt.  In summary, the great thing about Alan
Dugan at 78 is that, having weathered "experience," he's somewhat
skeptical."

Florid0: Water, ripples:
i can't remember anything any more. one person's
disaster is another person's pleasure. everyone has
had us, azure writes, writes alan. there is too much
water in the world, it flattens everything.

Florida: Azure, pool-side, jeans, red blouse pulled
up, mad (crazed) look in her eyes, seated:
i'll drown myself
and then i'll drown you

Floridb: Same as above, looking at camera:
then i'll drown everybody else

Floridc: Pool interior, distorted, from within:
you're out here i can
feel you

Floridd: Pool edge, ripples in blue-green water,
like skin:
then i'll drown everyone else

Floride: Azure at pool edge, same as above, leaning
back into the water, camera head-on:
late at night i lie here and i think of you, john,
and i think of you, susan, and i think of you,
david, i think of you fucking me, and i fall
backwards and i drown myself and i will take
you, i will take you with me

Floridf: Same as above, camera from side, Azure's
face ecstatic, ripples in blue-green water, like
skin:
i am thinking of you, may, and i am thinking
of you, george, and i am thinking, your mouths
are on me, your dead eyes are looking at me,
you are fucking me hard, you are dying there

Floridg: Alan, leaning back into water, t-shirt
and black jeans, exposed, shot from side, water
black:
i'm thinking about everything, i'm writing you
into this, the way the world is, is awful, i'm out
of control, i'm aroused and writing this, this is
from my state to your own

Floridh: Azure, exposed, shot from beneath by
pool-side, black background:
cynthia, i want your tongue against me alan,
please don't be upset, jack, alan write me down,
peter, azure inscribes me, i am everything you
want, i am everything you could possibly want

Floridi: Azure, still naked from waist down,
astride pool-side left-hand beach chair, blue
shirt (right-hand chair empty, partially
visible):
i am mad. i am completely out of my mind.

Floridj: Alan naked, lying back, right-hand
beach chair (left-hand beach chair empty,
partially visible), camera head-on:
i'm writing this, azure in the drowning pool, she
takes her lovers with her, she says, they're not as
good as you are, they couldn't be, they're down
there, she's pointing, i'm aroused, this is the
beginning of the game, this is the ending: how
the world works and everyone dies

Floridk: Two empty beach chairs, adjustable
actually, the right-hand one partially supine, the
left-hand one partially erect, no text.


Analysis:

Azure and I live alone together. We have no friends. I think: We are
horrors. Again and again our story turns on us. Our story repeats like a
bad record. Our story decays. We go for a drive. We drive long and hard
and nowhere. There is nowhere to go. We return home. Sometimes I go and
teach. I face students. We leave. We get in the car and drive long and
hard and nowhere. We go and return and look at each other. We stare at
each other. We wrestle each other to the ground. We take our clothes off.
We put them on.  We strangle ourselves. We turn ourselves inside out.

We are walking advertisements for art and poetry. I swim in the black
pool, the blue-green pool like skin. I swim two lengths beneath the
surface. I have heard you can pass out and keep swimming. You can be
swimming and drowning underwater. The surface looks: You are alive, you
are perfect person. The depth looks up: You are still swimming and you are
drowning.

How can you drown in so much beauty. We go to the pool and photograph. We
return for image and text, for art and poetry, for gimp and photoshop, for
perl and protocol, for process and program. Online we teeter on the brink
of culture. It is at the edge of the pool. The edge is an outline of
water. The apartment complex is Everglades reclaimed. At night I dream
alligators. I am ungainly; I can move fast, strike. No one is here. I am
thick-scaled, reptilian. My brain slips to edges. My brain swims. My brain
swims beneath.

Analysis:

Too much work on exposure. Too much exhibitionism, too much exhibition. As
if the body could be fixed, pierced, held in position. As if the world
were pure exchange. What other information we might provide.

Too many circuits of sexual tension, terror, power, language withdrawn in
the other face of the body, the other body of the face.

Work a caricature of itself. Stale work. Work which should have remained
stillborn. Dead work. Repetitive work. Work of the reflex arc, work of the
twitch.

Analysis:

Tearing apart, artist and model. The apartment is silent. Azure reads
upstairs; I type this on a laptop borrowed from the university. The
university has closed down new media. New media is tainted, condemned.
Images leak out: Our exposure is that of the naughty politics of the
world. I keep quiet about my work at the school. I show no one. I am
close to slaughter.

I continue to swim submerged. At the edge, I will push and push off. I
will make the other side.

This is ridiculous.  First of all, I have said three times that I didn't
write a poem just to please a poarticular editor.  I only said that I should
have selected poems that were more in line with the chapbook they selected
(a previous year). It was just a matter of selecting appropriate stuff from
what I had already written.  But we all write to please others and we are
all limited by the style of the times and the style of the people in our
school of writing, and it is normal to submit things to editors who share
one's tastes.  It would just be perverse to deliberately send things out
(especially a chapbook, which is a lot of work to prepare), to someone whose
taste seems to run against the style of your chapbook.  And since I have
years of work to choose from, I could easily have made a chapbook
subbmission that had a very different feel.  As could anyone here.  I don't
think any of the successful people here got that way by just waiting to be
published wuithout submitting anything, and I'm pretty certain they selected
both the work to submit and the editors they submitted to with great care.
It's just sloppy not to do that.  I don't see how that sloppiness represents
integrity.  I even have a historical argument making the claim that we
always have and always will have art that is made to please others and fit
the styles of the time...

Art was until the twentieth century defined by the idea that it was supposed
to be pleasurable to experience (well really until the last twenty years of
the nineteenth, when the Romantic period started, but I have to be vague
because there were different dates for poetry than for music or painting or
whatever).  People commissioned art to be something they would want to look
at or listen to, and the artist's pride was linked the the work of art
actually being pleasing (although of course one assumes some patrons had
lousy tastes and one imagines people other that the Medicis trying to
commission tasteless sculptures of brass unicorns frolicking under a
waterfall with real water coming down :-)  But the point was that the art
was intended to be pleasing to someone of "good taste" (a suspect term of
course).

After that, poeple started experimenting with all sorts of dissonances and
putting deliberately ugly things in their art or very ordinary things which
seemed unartistic, and one could say that was the beginning of "Art for
Art's Sake." -- but I think that's not quite right.  Artists were
experimenting with ways to use ugliness in ways that created beauty.  Viewed
up close, Monet's lilies were ugly (I actually don't like them much anyway),
Beethoven's late work was loud and had chords that didn't sound pleasing,
and people like Browning experimented (and people think of him as Victorian
and unoriginal because they dismiss the whole period, but he did change the
way we decide what's poetic I think) with lines of iambic pentameter which
seemed not to scan, full of mundane lists of unpoetic things that read aloud
sounded totally uneuphonious.

However, IMHO, these experiments were an effort to find new beauty, and they
were written to please the more radical fringe of the public.  Times had
changed, and monarchs were no longer on the cutting edge of the art world.
When we think of Queen Victoria, we don't think of poets like Browning or
(more obviously original but less influential I think) Hopkins, we think of
the kind of ghastly stuff you see in the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London, like teapots in the shape of heads of cabbages.  Real artists were
not in the business of pleasing poeple who wanted silverware with real
porcelain handles that looked like corncobs, they were in the business of
pleasing people in the art world. Their correspondence shows that they were
not creating art just for themselves but were instead forming schools of
art, in which they dedicated works to each other, edited each other's work,
and obviously wanted to please a public, which was "their" public, not the
general public.

This becomes even more apparent later on, when, for example, Eliot showed
Pound his draft of The Wasteland, which suppposedly was full of tacky
rhyming couplets, which Pound mercilessly cut, leaving only two or
something.  The Moderninsts wrote for each other, published each other, etc.
etc., so rather than pursuing some mythic muse who cared not for the tatses
of man, they were succumbing to (in the case of the Moderninsts, rather
excellent) peer pressure.

As we move yet forward, we find poets runnning small presses, publishing
poems they like from amongst their friends or unknown poets whose work fits
within their aesthetic.  On POETICS this is pretty evident, when anyone can
start and e-zine for free and because of places like the list, they can even
attract some very good poets to it.  But no one would deliberately submit
poems to someone that they thought the editor would dislike!  Editors like
to be more open-minded that that, in the sense that good editors do not
accept only work which is in their own style or a style they would like to
achieve themselves, but there are obvious limits.

Suppose that Robert Frost's poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowing Evening"
had not been written (so there would be no plagiarism involved) and that I
had submitted it to a literary magazine whose contents was experimental,
avant-garde, langpo-like, whatever...the kind of magazine people here write
for.  I am absolutely sure that the Frost poem would be rejected.  It might
even become an object of ridicule.  Someone might say, sneering, "It even
_rhymes_!"  And someone else would complain that the sleep=death symbolism
is painfully obvious, a total cliche.  And that the horse reminding the
narrator that he has responsibilities is cheating because the author just
needed some way to get his narrator out of the damned woods and had nothing
but the horse to use, barring having Robin Hood jump out from behind a tree,
or Peter Pan telling the narrator that there are no adults in
never-never-land...

So even if I were "inspired" to write "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"
(which actually isn't a bad poem. I even have a sentimental attachment to it
as it was the first poem I saw the point of without having a teacher explain
it...and I wrote a four-page long close reading of it during my earth
science class in tiny little letters.  I think the poem was actually quite
good, and it still is good, but only in its context, not in the context of
something I could write and submit to a magazine), I wouldn't do so.  And
none of the people who excoriated me for wanting to send an editor poems
that would actually fit the style of what he publishes would submit that
poem to any up-to-date journal either.  Even if that was what your muse
whispered to you insistently.  You would instead write fashionable poetry in
one of the currently available styles.

Of course the range of current styles is very broad.  You could be a New
Formalist and not an avant-garde person.  But you still couldn't submit the
Frost poem anywhere.  It always seems to us that any poetry we can imagine
is allowed and that being a true writer involves following our inspiration,
but our inspiration is limited by the boundaries of current practice.  Of
course you could write a poem which is totally new in every way, one that no
one has ever even come close to writing.  You might have a hard time
publishing it, but a truly new poem is possible given our period's rules (it
wasn't always so).  If you wrote a new poem and it got rejected, we'd all
understand that you were following your art and not bowing to convention.
However "new" things are very much a part of the current scene (although
maybe not as much as they were in the early post-modern period).

The point is that everyone carries around an editor in their head who knows
the boundaries of current taste.  And that editor is composed of the tastes
of all the people who you admire in the poetry world.  You are writing for
them, whether you know it or not.  And when you submit a poem for
publication, you don't do it unless your internal editor accepts it.  In
fact, you can't even write the poem unless the internal editor accepts it.
So why is trying to please a single real-life editor somewhow immoral?  It's
a lot easier that satisfying every poet whose taste you admire, which is
what you attempt when you actually write the poem.

I think to be compassionate towards this kid and his poetry is to operate
outside the corporate-bureaucratic system of systematic heartlessness. To
show compassion towards those who "don't deserve it" (i.e., because their
poem-product is "terrible"--a trite and overused word), is to be creatively
irrational, which of course makes "life more difficult." That this child has
joy in the process of writing poetry is a nice thing, overall, even if the
end result may not be all that one would desire. Sorry if I sound like I'm
moralizing, but I hate to see little kids getting picked on by bigger kids.

Millie,

I think somebody should come out clearly in your defense. What's the big deal
about submitting poems which might fit an editor's or panel's taste. I
understand very well if someone refuses to send work to award competions;
there maybe legitimate reasons for that. But I don't understand the idea of
sending work but refusing to consider the panel/editor's taste. Then, why is
one sending it?

Okay.  (Poor Patrick Herron.  Jumped ship just when
the knitting circle really starts purling.)

The discussion seems to be thematicizing into like
this:

1. THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE TERRIBLE AND THE DREADFUL /
CLASSISM

2. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR ALL POETRY

3. THE IDEAL OPRAH

-------------------------------------------------------

1. THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE TERRIBLE AND THE DREADFUL /
CLASSISM

I do not know what people mean by "good", "bad," and
the increasingly escalating "terrible" and "dreadful"
here.  (I never understand what it means to slippage
over those terms from ethics to aesthetics.)
Certainly, there's a usefulness in being able to speak
among the like-minded in a short-hand like that--- but
I don't know how to imagine what ~criteria~ those
assessments are being framed against.

(The only poem of his that I have read is the one that
was quoted on-List.)

Even in putting forward the criteria by which I found
his poem promisingly improveable and him ~educable~
("unmonitored abstractions"), I was moving onto thin
ice: no to Laura Riding Jackson's philosophical
abstractions, too?

His poem is ~not~ personist or autobiographical of the
type Buffalo satellites might be expected to object
to.  He's quite transcended "subjectivity" and The
Subject per se (although not with the greatest
eloquence),--- so it isn't objectionable on those
grounds.

It's remarkable --- and may come as quite a
head-spinner to Oprah's America --- that it does not
rhyme or have detectable buh-BUM buh-BUM buh-BUM
buh-BUM meter.  I had to be educated out of that
naivite, personally.

The tailoring of one complete sentence then PERIOD
per-line is noteworthy: no enjambment.

Despite my previous criticism of the "unmonitored
abstractions", his use of them is in fact so
blissfully indulgent in its excess ("Freedom",
"Tragedy", "terror", "Structure", "faith", "outrage",
"support" . . . ) that it creeps over into an almost
Blakean Songs of Innocence and Experience active
abstractness: "mutual fear brings peace, Misery's
increase / Are mercy, pity, and peace".


I ~also~ had to be educated out of thinking that
"good"/ "bad", "taste", was some sort of absolute,
univeralized standard recognizeable to everyone and
true everywhere.  It's not.

Currently, hierarchies from exemplary to lesser are
really only understandable by dint of --- here we go
again --- ~whom they serve~ and what groups they
advance: power.

Is the poem "dreadful" and "terrible" because it's not
displaying enough awareness of poetry at large (and
post-modernist opaque poetry, specifically)?

2. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR ALL POETRY REGARDLESS OF AGE
OR DISABILITY (OR GENDER? OR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL? OR
CLASS? ETC.?)

Coming from Millie, that gives me pause.  But, again,
I have to re-translate it:

If the sick wish to advance the social assimilation of
their fellow disabled, they should conform to socially
accepted norms.

Am I misrepresenting the thought?

It's better for the disadvantaged or special caste to
~impersonate~ the privileged majorities, in order
better to promote inclusion of their group?

3. THE IDEAL OPRAH

The list of titles that Oprah's Book Club promotes
does not match or even overlap with The New York
Review of Book's table of contents.  She is not known
to be a purveyor of fine arts/high culture reading.

She does do some type of ~good,~ though.  She's found
a way of re-directing her celebrity away from
gossip-raking over to the cause of high school level
literacy.

Relatives very close to me buy the books Oprah
mentions.  And they weren't particularly reading
before that.  Intelligent but uneducated high school
drop-outs now quite contently going through stacks of
"bad" novels, experiencing at least ~some~ level of
why ever we read.  And the comparative ~pandering~ of
Oprah's selections is not a dead-end to further
expansion: it seems to be an inroad.  My relative will
still return to the series of novels about the
detective whose cats help solve crimes,--- but when my
Hawthorne-Melville opera piqued curiosity, there
wasn't the old obstacle anymore and she picked up ~The
Scarlet Letter~ and on her own went on to ~The
Blithedale Romance.~  William Burroughs' ~Naked
Lunch,~ which she had the librarians reserve for her,
was a little more impassable,--- but she tends to
understand that she is not the infinite audience and
is bound by her own indoctrinations.


But---

Oprah is not isolated.  Elaine Paschen, the upper
crust former head of Poetry Society of America, who
shoved copies of her poetry books into Bill Clinton's
hands at the White House, or the likes of Paschen have
certainly crossed paths with Oprah at cocktail
parties.  Billy Collins, etc.

Do you think Oprah has never been asked, "Why don't
you ever feature poetry books?"

So, my Ideal Oprah:

Recognizing that that's been an oversight and deficit
in her recommendations, but understanding the
prejudices of her viewers and working through her own
limitations,---

Stepanek is a ~beginning~ in Oprah's Grand Scheme of
introducing poetry to TV watchers.

First, get 'em on a sob story type they can't resist.
Later, on the precedent and foundation of that
preliminary introduction, you/she can move a level, go
from Stepanek to some poet a little more
multi-dimensional (although Oprah, from my scant
knowledge of her, seems chauvinistically impervious to
"high fallutin'" required reading).

It's a ~beginning.~  She and we are coming from ~below
zero~ as far as television promotion of poetry.

I ~did~ read Book of the Month club Rod McKuen ~Listen
to the Warm,~ age 13, before I knew how to look
elsewhere to find more English Department accredited
poetry.

There is absolutely no way a responsible talk show
super-star --- or educator --- would jump start TV
watchers directly to--- Tina Darragh or somebody like
that.  It would totally back-fire.


Is it that we believe poetries other than "ours"
~should not exist?!~   Is everything supposed to
homogenize into healthy college-educated Caucasian
salaried ~Manderley~? (which I have not read yet.  New
School reading is on my calendar for tomorrow tonight.
 Luv ya, Rebecca! [Air kisses.] Welcome home)

It's definitely improved by this transformation...  Am I anticipating the
many variations on stepanek?  I'd do one but once I read the poem I felt no
compunctions about using my delete button.  I don't think it's fair to make
fun of the kid though.  There are many adults whose best effort at poetry
would be very similar, and many more who probably think the kid's poem is
good.  And there is an argument that in times of public sorrow, we need
cliches more than literature.  Literature raises questions and doubts, is
open to many interpretations, and can't be easily pinned down.  Cliches, on
the other hand, are good for expressing a feeling shared by many--they are
cliches precisely because they are feelings or thoughts shared by many.  A
real writer's response myight take off from 911 anbd go totally elsewhere.
It might, like Beughel's famous painting of Icarus drowning, feature the WTC
falling in one tiny sentence deep inside the work.  It might make us
actually think about what terrorism is saying and what might cause someone
to engage in it.  All of these literary possibilities are most unpatriotic
and might damage the nation's readiness to go to war and defeat the enemy
(whoever the enemy is).  You can't have THAT, can you, at a time of war...it
would be positively seditious.  (I hope my sarcasm is broad enough because

Queneau's Exercise de Style was perhaps all teh more memorable and brilliant
_because_ the text he worked on was (quite deliberately) banal and
uninspiring (except to Queneau, who apparently was inspired by either
writing or seeing the text).  Plus I can't get in a crowded bus in whihc
someone rudely pushes me without thinking of the Queneau book.  A great
thing about that book is that it is hirarious even to people who are
uninformed about surrealist games or math/oulipo stuff etc.  I first
encountered it as a child (my father had studied French literature and so
would show me French books, and I devoured it withiout understanding what
the point was at all.  Some of the funnier versions though migh nit be
transklatable, like the "feminine" version or the "official" version (which
is official-sounding in a waly only the French can be; after all until
recently you still had to sign business letters with a formula several lines
long using words that are not used except in that formula) or even the
"aloprs" version which simply puts "alors" in front of every sentence, which
is funnier in French than putting "So" in front of the sentences because the
alors thing is a way some people talk.

From someone with too much time on his hands, here is a
Oulipian treatment of Stepanek's poem, in the spirit of the
Merrill experiment and, more remotely, "On the Pumice of
Morons." This one has the serpent eating its own tail, the
end of the poem feeding backwards into the beginning, one
word at a time, until the whole thing disappears in the
middle. It's mapped to the word count of the original,
though I screwed that up somewhere (one word off at the
end). Some nice surprises emerge here ("no bless amazing
please, grace").

The poem is, after all, just a little chunk off of the crap
iceberg that is contemporary mass culture, so it doesn't
really bother me in itself, and I certainly don't mean to
be satirizing the poem or making fun of the kid. Just
messing about with the words.

All best,

I would not compare Merrill to ashbery or Kelly.  It's the wrong comparison
and you're bound to be disapppointed.  How about comparing Merrill with
Auden or Stevens or Hollander and to a lesser extent, say, Berryman or
Lowell?  Ashbery's is a poetics of images that attempt to affect the reader
while deliberately not making literal sense.  Compared to Ashbery, Merrill
is not an innovator and could be seen as someone who just takes a little bit
of ivory and polishes and polishes it (not my image).  But Merrill was often
experimental as far as subject matter and organization of poems was
concerned.   I guess the difference is that most _sentences_ of a Merrill
poem are ones which someone could conceivably write or say.  Merrill could
never write a sentence like "The cold sunrise attacks one side of the giant
capital letters, bestirs a little landmass as it sinks, grateful, but
asleep" (taken randomdly from Ashbery.  The poem is Fantasia on "the Nut
Brown Maid")

But Ashbery never (to my mind) reaches the peaks of lyricism because to a
certain extent, the stringest effects happen when there is an image that is
string both as a collection of words and as a semantic relation involving
real objects.  It is hard to feel strongly about nonsense (I don't use the
word pejoratively). One can laugh at it, and be impressed by it, and enjoy
it, but one can't really be moved by it.

There are some very simple stanzas of Merrill's that I find absolutely
haunting.  For example:

A cold so keen
My speech unfurls tonight
As from the chattering teeth
Of a sewing machine.

What's amazing about that to me is not particularly the metaphor of the
sewing machine (which I like), but the fact that every word is right.
Without "keen", "unfurls", and "chattering" the lines wouldn't work at all,
viz:

A chill so deep
That tonight I talk
Through the trembling teeth
Of a sewing machine

On the other hand, you can mess with the Ashbery without damaging it too
much: "The monsoon sweeps between the big serifs of her words, rushing
through valleys, causing despair."

Ian. I mentioned once something about poetry to my mother and she said
rapidly and a bit sharply for her: "I hate poetry"  (she preferred novels).
If I were you I'd either pretend I wasnt a poet or invent some elaborate lie
proving that in fact you were only joking and actually the boy on Oprah was
the sort of thing you wanted to to do or a glorious ode to mr Wolf  or
Rumsfeld etal and how wonderful they all are these fire fighters and
politicians..or something about a drowned spastic kitten that Oprah might
like...but dont tell any sexy women or family you're a poet: in fact, keep
away from family reunions: I see one young man went so far in this respect
that he joined the Al Qaeda...but you can stay where you are...you dont need
to knock over any public buildings...just start acting..well my technique is
to ignore most communications from my sisters and everyone who sends
Christmas cards and  having a brother (who I actually rather like!) well out
of the way and a brother-inlaw who hates my guts and a sister who is  a
religious nut (Christian of some type) and is (I hope) scared to visit me
..and generally being unlikeable and grumpy (except of course to my
children)...helps enormously in avoiding parties and "celebrations" so I am
always able to do what I want when I want: and the fact that I write
incomprehensible poems which very few people are ever going to be interested
in is probably put down to "madness" as poets are still either ignored or
considered to be subversive or psychotic or whatever: and for Christ sakes
dont go on Oprah Winfrey!! You'll NEVER hear the end of it...I had a bit
part in a local  soap "Shortland Street" as a grumpy nuerotic landlord (a
role I play without acting)  and I said one line, was on for about 2 minutes
and hundreds of people I'd forgotten I knew and who had just seen me around
spotted it!! And I dont even watch the show: it must be terrible to be
recognised like those bizzarre pop stars or people on TV: Oprah maybe should
follow up her programs with an investigation into how many people she has
"pushed over the edge" and how many she's assisted with their defficiencies
or bizzarities (I dont mean to becoming more bizzare or twisted...or do I?:
but no, keep it quiet about being a poet...I read the bio of old T S Eliot
and he was getting off a bus in London and (I think this was before
television) an Indian student (probably a sincere and fervent writer to be)
recognised him: according to the biog he spent 20 minutes agreeing how
interesting this was and what a coincidence and how unfortumate but indeed
he WASNT the poet  T S Eliot: maybe not embarrassed at being a poet but
certainly upset at the vulgarity of being "recognised' ....I can tell you
from my brief foray into Television that I have no desire for Hollywood, I
found it an interesting experience but the pay is low (unless you're a major
"star" as they call them) but if 60 seconds produces that result God help
those on Oprah or any other media like that. But remember: avoid you're
family and dont let on you're a poet. Cheers, Richard.

i can't help but wonder what (st)age are folks who have issues with an
eleven yr old kid getting a little attention for a few words he wrote... or
is it the *professing* to have issue w/it so that one may announce one's
position re 'bad poetry'? i've better things to bitch about - i'm finding it
tiresome that most (a few exceptions, of course) posts here (list) are
primarily concerned w/polishing the ol' projected image (announcements,
judgments, pronouncements) & self-promo moreso than interest in conversation
& exploration (which i used to think was of interest to most 'poets.' naive)
& by so doing seem to inhibit the latter & cause general crappy feeling.
judging from patrick's last posts & the following (non) reception to it, in
addition to what's   absent,  c&e here are about dead. it's making me
grumpy, damnit. i'm (finally, after four years) feeling most disillusioned,
maybe it's the season...

that's all, i'll shut up now. i realize i'm talking to walls at any rate.

Bill. Not "so delights me" but certainly I find him an interesting poet:
what would come of us if we all wrote like, well, in a certain style: our
"radical" and disjunctive writings would become the yawn norm...no, I got
interested in him via a book by Lyn Keller who writes excellently on I think
it was Stevens and Ashbery, Williams and Creeley, and Auden and Merrill
which led me into his poetry but I havent read as much as I'd like to have
of any of these authors. When I have time I'm going to have a look at
Sondheim's work more closely ( I got his CD Rom) : after all here is a
contemporary living poet who is available and fresh online so to speak...but
as you know one man's meat...what I have found is that a good critique-ing
critic (as against a criticism) will either elucidate a work or by his or
her enthusiasm and or lead you into poets you (one) had neglected:
Christopher Smart I hadnt heard of until my friend Scott Hamilton enthused
over it..and (father forgive me for I have sinned) I photocopied that
strange and fascinating  poem, who else do I like..Brryman, Roethke, many of
the New York poets,  Spicer, many of the Langpos and their derivatives or
associates, many New Zealand poets  eg Michelle Leggott, Vincent O'Sullivan
(sometimes he is reminiscent of Merrill altho not so ornately complex
perhaps), the Curnows (Wystan and Allan) esspecially I like Wystan's small
book "Castor Bay" and "Cancer Diary" as well as his description of a
"happenning" down at the gas works which I discovered in an old mag produced
by Alan Loney ( who is worth a look at) and other things: but there are many
others: Bill Manhire is quite brilliant and sometimes Richard von Sturmer
and so on.Jack Ross has produceed a strange and fascinating prose poem
"thing" called "nights With Giodorno Bruno" which I reviewed for  Brief and
I might (I will) send a shortened version of that tothe List Some of the
poets in "Brief" ed John Geraets are interesting and Scott Hamilton's SALT
had myself, Scott, Hamish Dewe, Michael Arnold and others: there are many
many talented poets in NZ but just as in the States the "Official Verse"
stuff is given he nod. I generalise but I dont think editors anywhere often
recognise real passion and inventiveness; real innovation. A handful of
editors SEE but the history of literature favours poets sucha as Emily
Dickinson and Hopkins and many others when they are dead...in art Van
Gogh...in music J S Bach and real inventors such as Cage, Varese, Xenakis,
Stockhausen might be recognised but one suspects that those "in power" or in
publishing keep anything of great value or real voltage at a distance:
success and recognition for a writer in his her own life time is probably a
sign that they are actually quite ordinary poets artists musicians etc...but
maybe that is  not always so....most publishers (for good reasons) have to
watch the $signs etc
  But certainly we owe it to our fellow poets (living and dead ) to value
and carefully evaluate and consider and discuss their work.
  In the end of course there will be such debates or likes and dislikes of
one poet or another...so its not a question of Merrill delighting me per
se...anyway, all the best for Xmas to you Bill and everyone. Richard

Damian, I think the kid should be certainly given a credit for writing all the right buzzwords down, but, of course, he is not a poet, so he could not put them together in the "right order". Here is another take on his poem, this one being a prosody treatment:
___

Nada requests the pleasure of your company
  at the Flying Saucer Cafe
  494 Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn
  on the evening of Tuesday January 8
  at 8 pm

******************Martha King & Basil King*******************************


Poet/prose writer Martha King attended Black Mountain College briefly
as a teenager in the late 1950s, and married the painter Basil King
in San Francisco. She began writing
regularly in the early 1970s, after the birth of their two daughters, Mallory
and Hetty. She edited Giants Play Well in the Drizzle, which she sent gratis
to interested readers, from 1983 to 1993.  Her most recent book is a
collection of prose, Little Tales of Family and War, from Spuyten Duyvil.
Separate Parts is forthcoming from Avec.   Other books include Women and
Children First, Weather, Islamic Miniature, Monday Through Friday, and
Seventeen Walking Sticks. She will read from her new book Selected,
Collected, Published and Unpublished.


Painter/poet Basil King attended Black Mountain College and completed
his apprenticeship
as a painter in San Francisco and New York.  Although he did not begin to
write until 1986, his involvement with poetry has always been part of his
life, first doing art to accompany poems in books and magazines, later as a
book artist and now as a poet/painter.  Some of his larger paintings can be
seen on the Web at the Spuyten Duyvil and Avec sites.  His most recent book,
Warp Spasm, has just been published by Spuyten Duyvil.  Other books include
Split Peas,  Miniatures, Devotions, Identity,  and The Poet.

At the Flying Saucer, he will present the opening sections of his ongoing
work, "Mirage" -- combining slides of art and text which is sequentially
poetry, prose, recollection, and invention.  Some "Mirage" text (without
images) is currently on the Web at Light&Dust@Grist
(http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm)  a highly recommended site.


HOW TO GET THERE: Take the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or D or Q to the Atlantic
Subway stop and walk underground to the Pacific Street exit (at the N or R
or M Pacific Street Stop) or take the B or N or R or M - in any case, go
out the Pacific Street Exit (right exit), take a right - at the end of the
block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying
Saucer Cafe.

Could we stop using the word "cripples?"  It's really
offensive.  And, as for the whole phenomenon of this
young poet, really, why are we harping on it at all?
If you're so concerned about "mediocrity" getting
attention, the best revenge is to make great art.
'Nuff said.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

i need help.

i'm studying modes of recognition of poetry.

on the web, how do we recognize words used in language as poetry, how
do we know we are having a poem? i mean before we start to interpret
it or process it for meaning/feeling.

in print we see a visual pattern or arrangement, we see line lengths,
we see indentations from the left margin and we visually recognize it
as poetry, we see also phonological elements, rhyme, rhythms
translated from oral culture, we then interpret what we read as
poetry, or by the special rules of reading a text as belonging to a
poetic discourse.

in live performance there are visual recognition stimuli; a spotlit
area; a microphone; chairs arranged in a room pointing towards the
performance area; a person holding an opened book or papers. There
are definitely phonological signs we identify also; the poet's
projected voice (not normal speaking voice); sound patterns (rhyme,
rhythm, alliteration, assonance) being sounded, which we have learnt
to recognize as poetry.

in web environments how do i tell if i've come across a poem? is it
merely the same signs we use to recognize poetry in print and in live
performance, or are there unique recognition stimuli for
web/cyber/new/digital/hypermedia poetry?
do we need visual evidence of text or aural presence of text to be
poetry in this medium?


i would appreciate some thoughts on this

cheers

Though I know this work (I think) was the one conjured through ouija
(right?)
I'd be curious to know about any of the religious content therein (if any?)
Wasn't ephraim the son of joseph--as in the coat of many colors.  Having
grown
up a mormon (and now most certainly not one) I remember being blessed once
and told I was from the tribe of Ephraim.  I believe ephraim was given the
birthright after the elder brother whose name I forget spoiled his chance.
I remember being told that most amerikans are given, during their
"patriarchal
blessing," that tribe as their lineage (as opposed to the 12 original and
subsequent lines).....just curious and scooping up some odd facts there.

One can compare any poet to any other: but I was just listing some poets at
random ..... Bill ausrin  is and most on the list are well aware of the big
difference between the poets: but there are points of intersection...which
can be seen by looking a "Remaking it New" by Lynn Keller which is the book
that gave me some insights into Merrill. I agree with your comments but I
dont lie awake thinking about Merrill...I went through an Ashbery jag though
for a while..but I've read so much that it all starts to seem the same: Alan
Sondheim is the most interesting poet for me at the moment and a few New
Zealand poets...
  I think you're wrong about Ashbery though: he's a different poet but in my
book at his best and in many of his poems and his books (not all of course)
one of the greatest poets: there are some extraordinary beautiful and
lyrical moments that put him with the best poets ever.
  But he seems lately to be running on automatic...but he's written masses
of books. Kelly is also very different (altho eqaully prolific) and I
enjoyed his poems which are somewhat into the "deep image" thing.
  Everyone sees something different in different poets. Regards, Richard.

outside the corporate-bureaucratic system of systematic heartlessness. >>

   Eh?  The corporate-bureaucratic system is what has printed
ziggity-jillion copies of his book, is sending him around the country and
exhibiting him on television, and generally relying upon the
deep-heartedness of the people who are paying for his book.  It is selling
his courage and his effort to not merely endure but prevail.  Corporations
are subtler swine than you are crediting them with being -- someone in the
corporate system wanted to print that book to make the kid happy, yes, but
they were also gambling that your compassion would open your wallet.

>>To show compassion towards those who "don't deserve it" (i.e., because
their
poem-product is "terrible"--a trite and overused word), is to be creatively
irrational, which of course makes "life more difficult." >>

   What kind of compassion are you recommending?  To say his poems will last
with Frost or Ashbery?  Why bullshit this smart, brave kid?  This is a
little boy who has to have his lungs vacuumed every hour or two -- he
deserves better.  Whoever it was that said the rest of us should stand what
we could write at age eleven against what he writes is fairer, and more to
the point.  Isn't enough to say, 'pretty good for eleven, not grown-up
poetry?'

  Obviously he's only being published because he's gravely ill -- it's like
the old crack comparing a woman doing something-or-other to a dog getting up
on his hind legs and giving a speech-- the astonishment being not that the
thing was done well, but that it was done at all.  Having read a newspaper
interview with him, I suspect the boy understands that perfectly well, too.
One wishes him the luck of living to be older and writing better poems.

   Then he can sell 28 copies a year of his brilliant book of poems just
like the rest of us.  And the Jimmy Stewart or Jewel or gravely ill child of
that era can go on to be the year's best selling poet.

You said I said:


2. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR ALL POETRY REGARDLESS OF AGE
OR DISABILITY (OR GENDER? OR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL? OR
CLASS? ETC.?)

Coming from Millie, that gives me pause.  But, again,
I have to re-translate it:

If the sick wish to advance the social assimilation of
their fellow disabled, they should conform to socially
accepted norms.

Am I misrepresenting the thought?

It's better for the disadvantaged or special caste to
~impersonate~ the privileged majorities, in order
better to promote inclusion of their group?
-------

You didn't misstate what I said but you lost the context, which was that
"sadly" this is true.  I also said that logically, if we wanted to prove
that we aren't morons by writing poetry, we should only have to write the
poetry average people who are not morons write, which generally isn't very
good (to use a loaded term, of course).

I think it is silly to make poetry-writing the center of a claim that
disabled people are as worthy of respect or love or care as other people.
All people are worthy of respect, etc., by virtue of being human, and there
are certainly som ediability groups whoo can never write as good poetry as
non-disabled folks (say people who are multiply handicapped and can neither
move nor speak and are mentally retarded (one hopes these people have
extremely sever mental deficiencies because if they are even conscious of
existing it must be hellish)).

A lot of times minority groups claim to have a culture of their own and want
not to be judged by the standards of the majority.  Perhaps a group very
invested in this idea wouldn'ty want to compete in the field of poetry
because it isn't their domain.  Or they would have a poetry so different
from ouirs that we couldn't understand it. Recently, disability groups have
made use of the "we're different, not better or worse" idea.  The Deaf (who
demand the right to be capitalized) have done this the most, presumably
because they share a language that non-Deaf people rarely  if ever achieve
fluency in.  Deaf poetry does exist and it is incomprehensibe to non-Deaf
people, although there are also productions which try to mix Deaf and
hearing words, music, and dance.

I think crazy people have a culture, too, but I don't know that we have our
own poetics.  (If we did it might be like the weirder poems of James Tate.
Some of his works depict paranoia and most depict tangential thinkinig and
derailment, which are thought disorders according to the psychiatrists. But
unfortunately for us, James Tate invented his poetics and not one of us,
unless he is a closet case.)  Crazy people are more likely to use standard
poetry with subject matter related to our situation, although there is also
a trend to use pseudo-psychotic tangential thinking methods, which I think
is a more exciting direction than just imitating standard discourse.  I
think there are real possibilities for prose poems that are crazy and don't
just talk about ctaziness, but I don't know of published examples.

The reason I taught different schools of poetry when I taught mentaly ill
people is that I wanted them to see that there are possiblities available
other than simply stating your thoughts or feelings and adding in line
breaks. Many people (not just mentally ill people) think that this is all
there is to poetry.  (I'd make a snide comment about what poets they
probably read, only I'm afraid the person might be on this list!)  The
reaction I got to teaching postmodern poems was a kind of relief and , "wow,
you mean we're allowed to do this!"  People who are interested in words and
poetry often have experimented and played with language, but they may have
received ideas that you have to have lines all the same length and you have
to make sense and the thought has to end at the end of the line (personally,
I think enjambment was one of the great inventions in poetry.  When was it
invented?).

Anyway, by teaching poetry to mentally ill people and putting together my
ezine (which I am on the brink of releasing the new issue of) which is half
by mentally ill people, I didn't intend to prove that mentally ill people
are more creative than other people because they can write poetry, but
rather that mentally ill _poets_ can be as good as other poets.  My zine
will have one poem that makes me wince with its badness and for personal
reasons (no, I am not dating the author, but he was one of the first to
submit, and I thanked him profusely, before I read the poem...and I didn't
make clear that I could reject stuff...I rejected the very worst poem he
wrote but kept one I don't like) I didn't see how to reject it.  Other than
that, I think it has decent work.  The first issue (mostly stories) was
better I think.  This time I have some works that stand up but others that
are blah (and the one poem which is bleccch).

just the most amazing jam session dumping on this kid who, at least for me,
writes better poetry than when I was 11.  presumably, many in this circle
wrote better than he at 11.  and think about all the garbage an 11 yr. old
has to penetrate today...more tightly locked down goalposts and Bob Simon
news bs and consciousness crap.  i suppose that his physical condition like
my youthful asthma freed him somewhat of that junk.  rather than stand
around and point, welcome a young poet among others who think themselves
poets.  he's a friend.  poetry, in  ancient days, was the most public art.

Millie, I think you've entered one of those "there're two kinds of people in
the world" areas: in this case, those who are moved by nonsense and those
who aren't.  (It's tempting to be flip and point out that millions of people
are moved by nonsense every night on prime time TV, but I'll be serious for
a minute [harumph, ahem] and stipulate that we're talking about linguistic
utterances that are not reducible to a meaning that reflects actual or
potential conditions of reality.  I know there are problems with what
"reality" means, but let's go with this for now, OK?)

The lines you quote from "Fantasia on 'The Nut Brown Maid'" are useful,
because they illustrate Ashbery's power to do precisely what you're saying
can't be done: move with "nonsense."

I'm taking it you're considering these lines nonsense because we don't know:
A) what the "giant capital letters" are or what they're doing there (maybe
it's the Hollywood sign or something, but still, why?); B) why he would
describe the sunrise as "attack[ing" these letters; C) how such an attack
could possibly "[bestir] a little landmass"; D) how a landmass could be
"grateful" and "asleep" at the same time (or for that matter how a landmass
could be either of those things, period.

Granted.  But if a reader is really attentive to the images and concepts
here, as everywhere else in the poem, it becomes impossible, in my opinion,
not to have an affective response to them.  You may not know what's going on
or why, but you are made to _picture_ it nevertheless.  And in picturing it,
certain elements come together to form ... not a narrative, exactly, but the
_feeling_ of a narrative.  Or more precisely, you have feelings similar to
those you have while experiencing an _actual_ narrative, because you
encounter motions and expressive details that are familiar to you from the
sort of referential narratives that are in part the model for Ashbery's
work.  These effects often have more to do with rhythm and cadence than with
what is being "said": as Ashbery says elsewhere in the same poem, "What I am
writing to say is, the timing, not / The contents, is what matters."  Just
sit back and imagine the sunrise doing its thing with the big letters and
the landmass etc.: don't you feel a little something?  Isn't that what
poetry is for--giving you feelings you can't explain?

Millie, I think you've cheated a little here, because you're not merely
paraphrasing, but changing the meaning entirely, both with the Merrill and
the Ashbery.  In Merrill's case, by removing "unfurls" you've removed the
central image: that of the speaker's steamy speech / breath resembling white
thread coming out of a machine.  A more accurate rewording might be
something like:

A chill so deep
That my speech ravels out
As through the trembling teeth
Of a sewing machine.

Your point, however, which is well taken, is that changing the words, even
while preserving the referential meaning, disrupts the emotional power of
the sound of the language.  Well, yes.  But doesn't that show that at least
part of what moves in poetry has nothing to do with sense?

In the case of the Ashbery, you've inserted a monsoon in place of the
sunrise, assigned a gender to something or other, added some valleys and
despair, etc.  The new passage bears little relation to the original except
that it too involves some big letters.  It thus becomes hard to claim that
anything has been illustrated about the power (or lack thereof) of the
original utterance.  So then, how about this: "The frigid morning light
assails one side of the huge block letters, sets in motion a small landmass
as it submerges, thankful, but slumbering."

One thing I notice in performing this exercise is how economical Ashbery's
language is: with the exception of the slightly archaic "bestirs," every
word in the quoted passage is humbly prosaic taken by itself.  It is very
difficult to find suitable substitutes for words as specific as "cold,"
"sunrise," "attacks," "capital letters," and so forth.  Some of my
replacement words are deeply unsatisfying (e.g., the pretentious
"slumbering" for "sleeping"), and in the case of something like "landmass,"
I haven't even tried.  More importantly, to my ears this paraphrase destroys
the poetry of the original; yours was not so destructive, Millie, because it
was in effect an entirely new poem.  My hunch is that Merrill is actually
the _easier_ of the two writers to paraphrase and still preserve some of his
particular music, because he deals in far less specialized expressions.
That is, he describes things whose relation to our lives is pre-recognized
and somewhat "guaranteed," rather than things whose relevance must be
decoded at great length, with no promise of closure.  For this reason,
"precision" is at least as much, if not more, at stake in Ashbery as it is
in Merrill.

(IThis is of course a matter of subjective response to a great degree, but I
feel that Ashbery, among living poets, gets about as close to "the peaks of
lyricism" as anyone.  Even if we accept your very New-Critical-sounding
formulation that "the strongest effects happen when there is an image that
is strong both as a collection of words and as a semantic relation involving
real objects," Ashbery seems to fit the bill.  All the things he mentions
are real objects, and they are certainly in some kind of semantic relation.
That this relation is not one we would ordinarily encounter in the course of
our daily experience hardly seems to disqualify the poetry as "moving,"
especially if we consider poetry to be a use of language that, among other
things, explores unknown territory in the hopes of awakening our senses to
strange feelings.

That's all, I'll stop now.  Since you either are moved or not by a piece of
writing, I'm obviously not saying that you're "wrong" not to be moved by
Ashbery, or to be moved by Merrill, for that matter--just that I don't think
it's possible to make a blanket pronouncement about nonsense's emotional
power.

        And there is nothing more brutal than a black market capitalism. To steal
means the goods are in the stores produced. Production cannot happen in
anarchy.

Where does mass-culture poetry come from? Is it a
half-digested imitation of "official verse culture"
workshop poetry? Does it come out of what people read in
grade school? School probably has a bigger influence than
OVC, since I doubt Mattie Stepanek, or Jewel, or Henry
Rollins or whatever, read much in the way of Ploughshares
and Grand Street and Paris Review -- but what I think it
really comes out of is the "other tradition" of amateur
versifying that lots of people plugged into as adolescents
and some continued into adulthood, with no real ambition to
be more than amateurs. It's like a kind of folk art, and
the standards for success are different than in OVC or the
classics. The practice is represented now by tons of
websites (www.poetry.com is the motherlode).

This kind of poetry goes on (scads of it really) under the
radar of academics and published poets, having nothing
really to do with that culture -- it's the poetry of
somebody who did well in a creative writing class once,
or, to be less cynical, somebody who gets private
satisfaction from modest practice of the craft (and more
power to them as long as I don't have to read it). The web
is a good place to suss it out, lots of "journals"
that exist solely for the benefit of the writers who get
published in them, not far off from the personal website --
"here's some pictures of my dog, and here's some poems I
wrote about snorkling". But it's interesting -- what does
*that* subculture want from art? One thing it definitely
wants is not to have to know a whole lot about poetry
(technique, tradition, what's cool) in order to write it
and get a little aesthetic buzz, be part of a little (very
unofficial) verse culture, feel like an Artist (because
we're all Artists, deep down, aren't we? I mean, Deepak
Chopra says so). And so that's why Mattie Stepanek is on
Oprah -- because everybody knows about that kind of thing
anyway, knows somebody who writes "a little poetry",
wouldn't know Paris Review (not to mention EPC) if it hit
them in the ass and doesn't care either, and this is just
the kind of poetry they like: easy to understand,
sentimental, chicken soup for the soul. Something almost
anybody could do -- but by some standards a skill anybody
with gumption can learn is the best kind (embroidery, auto
body repair, poetry).

I think what bothers me about Oprah's love affair with the
written word is that it commodifies the practice of
amateurs. They were always there and they didn't need Oprah
until she convinced them they did.

Kominos. I dont think the question is limited to on line poetry or work I
think that eg the work of  Alan Sondheim and alsso some of the online visual
poems so to speak (altho that's not what Alan's work is per se) but I
mentioned him because of his great (certainly extensive and enthusaistic)
project on and about the net and other concerns: I think that these things
underline and point again to the question of poetry: what is it and how is
it defined? In some ways the "old" forms were "natural", practical: or at
least provided limitations..the tennis with the nets up..nothing wrong with
that but what about another concept that cuts out any imposed artificial
rules ( I dont mean that neglects the possibility or usefulness of rules and
so on) but which is constantlly developing, constantly growing and has no
final perceived form (a kind of mirror of life - I mean the living world as
it is (ad or seems))? : I dont mean thus to return to realism or whatever,
but into a concept which allows the interaction of many forms and which is
(at first sight so to speak at least, formless): it, this kind of poem,
finds itself, is its own making -has no beginning or end, no rules: may or
may not be authorless...some thoughts.
  The practical problem of the Intenet is the very fact that one cannot
(well I find it hard especially as I have an old slow printer) to sit down
and think more deeply over  eg Alan Sondheim or some of the other writers on
this list etc although the screen isnt too bad to scroll.  In many of the
things I write or attempt I have a feeling that the form or layout is
irrelevant (its "the message" I want to covey which often isnt a messsage
"about" anything but is a message all the same!): although that isnt the
case with all things ... butI make very quick and insticntive or intuitive
decisions as to word use and layout: but setting up some poems I  have felt
it neccessary that the  layout be absolutely exact (although my exactness or
feeling of rightness of layout is often "instinctive" .. I like the fashion
of the caesura in the middle line. The net like a book of course is limited
by phyisical restraints: imagine a book that was 100 feet square!! Or a
computer with a screen as a large as China! Nothing wrong with that or those
sizes but a bit hard to take to bed: obviously another limitation on the net
is the screen, the computer software, and the stamina of the reader or
"observor"....
  Just some thoughts on the subject - nothing greatly original - but some
discussion might ensue from this and your remarks. Regards, Richard.

Thank you Marcella! I concur...

now can't we all move on to other subjects...we all begin somewhere as
artists, he has just had the opportunity or wings to be published young. how
many pages of poetry have we all thrown away from that time in our lives?
Isn't it good that a child is being recognized...whether he is handicapped or
not, he is a boy, whose journey has just begun--not a self-proclaiming
arrogant poet who has read hundreds of books of his predecessors?

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Digital Poetics
The Making of E-Poetries
Loss Peque=F1o Glazier

In this revolutionary and highly original work, poet-scholar Loss
Glazier investigates the ways in which computer technology has
influenced and transformed the writing and dissemination of poetry. =

Glazier argues that the increase in computer technology and
accessibility, specifically the World Wide Web, has created a new and
viable place for the writing and dissemination of poetry. Glazier's work
not only introduces the reader to the current state of electronic
writing but also outlines the historical and technical contexts out of
which electronic poetry has emerged and demonstrates some of the
possibilities of the new medium.

Glazier examines three principal forms of electronic textuality:
hypertext, visual/kinetic text, and works in programmable media. He
considers avant-garde poetics and its relationship to the on-line age,
the relationship between web "pages" and book technology, and the way in
which certain kinds of web constructions are in and of themselves a type
of writing. With convincing alacrity, Glazier argues that the
materiality of electronic writing has changed the idea of writing
itself. He concludes that electronic space is the true home of poetry
and, in the 20th century, has become the ultimate "space of poesis."
Digital Poetics will attract a readership of scholars and students
interested in contemporary creative writing and the potential of
electronic media for imaginative expression.


"[Glazier] does a superb job of demonstrating the relevance of 20th
century innovative poetries as a means to understanding the implications
and possibilities of current digital writing developments."

I I reamlize my post could seem trivial, but figure there are other
poets on yhis list who share my interest in new alang and whence it
derives. I am only a language mechanic, but figure that, as such, I
may from time to time be allowed to post to this list.  As anyone
knows who has watched its ways, the list often moves very obliquely
from one topic to the next. I assure you, I meant no rudeness towards
you, and am sorry that my post has made you rude towards me. I guess
that's just the way the cookie crumbled this rime around. Yr
-e-friend, David

I had no idea that Ari Fleischer was on this list.

I had thought that an issue of avant-garde poetics was the commodification of
poetry so any move into the popular culture -- Oprah, MTV's "Spoken Word"
programs, and Russell Simmons Def Jam Poets -- might be worth discussion.  I
thought the re-visions of the kid that resulted were great:  "child ash" and
"the national security sky" are two phrases from those re-visions that stay
with me.

But you're right B. Andrews, let's all just keep writing and telling one
another about that writing through the press releases and advertisements that
we're writing and then we'll all know that we're writing and we'll be writing.

Elizabeth Treadwell said she shops at Target. This year I did the bulk =
of my holiday shopping there, as well. I'm imagining this two-poet =
Target scenario expanding like a Nike ad, with numerous poets saying =
they shop there or voiceovers announcing "Even the avant-garde finds =
what it needs at Target." Now, if only they'd carry some serious =
literature or sponsor a poetry series... (dream on)

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

We Who Love to Be Astonished
Experimental Women's Writing and Performance Poetics
Edited by Laura Hinton and Cynthia Hogue

This is the first critical volume devoted to the full range of women's
postmodern works and includes some of the most respected writers and
critics in the contemporary avant-garde.

We Who Love to Be Astonished collects a powerful group of previously
unpublished essays to fill a gap in the critical evaluation of women's
contributions to postmodern experimental writing. Contributors include
Alan Golding, Aldon Nielsen, and Rachel Blau DuPlessis; discussions
include analyses of the work of Kathleen Fraser, Harryette Mullen, and
Kathy Acker, among others. The editors take as their title a line from
the work of Lyn Hejinian, one of the most respected of innovative women
poets writing today.
The volume is organized into four sections: the first two seek to
identify, from two different angles, the ways women of different
sociocultural backgrounds are exploring their relationships to their
cultures' inherited traditions; the third section investigates the issue
of visuality and the problems and challenges it creates; and the fourth
section expands on the role of the body as material and performance.
The collection will breach a once irreconcilable divide between those
who theorize about women's writing and those who focus on formalist
practice. By embracing "astonishment" as the site of formalist-feminist
investigation, the editors seek to show how form configures feminist
thought, and, likewise, how feminist thought informs words and letters
on a page. Students and scholars of avant-garde poetry, women's writing,
and late 20th-century American literature will welcome this lively
discussion.


"This is an important collection, especially in its emphasis on
multicultural experimental writing, and on differences between modes of
experimental writing."

Apologies to the List for a somewhat duplicated posting (of Mark
Wallace's earlier announcement)....


Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Telling it Slant
Avant-Garde Poetics of the 1990s
Edited by Mark Wallace and Steven Marks

Some of the finest essays from the newest generation of critics and
poet-critics are gathered together in this volume documenting the growth
in readership and awareness of avant-garde poetries.

This collection demonstrates the breadth and openness of the field of
avant-garde poetry by introducing a wide range of work in poetics,
theory, and criticism from emerging writers. Examining the directions
innovative poetry has taken since the emergence and success of the
Language movement, the essays discuss new forms and the reorientation of
older forms of poetry in order to embody present and ongoing
involvements. The essays center around four themes: the relation between
poetics and contemporary cultural issues; new directions for avant-garde
practices; in-depth explorations of current poets and their
predecessors; and innovative approaches to the essay form or
individual poetics.
Diverging from the traditional, linear argumentative style of academic
criticism, many of the essays in this collection instead find critical
forms more subtly related to poetry. Viewed as a whole, the essays
return to a number of shared issues, namely poetic form and the
production of present-day poetry.  While focusing on North American
poetry, the collection does reference the larger world of contemporary
poetics, including potential biases and omissions based on race and
ethnicity.
This is cutting-edge criticism at its finest, essential reading for
students and scholars of avant-garde poetry, of interest to anyone
working in contemporary American literature and poetry.

"This is the book that many people have been eagerly awaiting, since the
articulation of the poetics of the constellation of innovative poets has
never been gathered with such force and persuasiveness in any magazine
or other collection.  This book is truly news."
        -Charles Bernstein, series editor

Church (131 East 10th Street) on Thursday, December 27th. In Maria del
Bosco, three ravishingly beautiful ballerinas fantasize a racing car that
carries them into dreams of love and catastrophe. The three drop-dead
beauties are attacked by the strange erotic props and accessories, which ar=

manipulated by a group of coolly aggressive young men.

In this daring and unprecedented "Sound Opera," Foreman uses only forty

Poets pleased with response from baboons

Story filed: 17:41 Tuesday 18th December 2001
http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_476651.html?menu=3D

A group of seven Chilean poets who held a poetry reading in a baboon=20
enclosure have praised the animals' patience.

It had been feared they could attack the poets who wanted to=20
demonstrate baboons are more receptive to poetry than their=20
countrymen.

Poet Leonel Lienlaf says were surprised by the warm welcome they had=20
got from the monkeys at Santiago's Metropolitan Zoo.

Colleague Ra=FAl Zurita told Las Ultimas Noticias newspaper he was=20
pleased they had not attacked the cage the poets were in.

"In fact, they were impressively alert, as well as showing the kind=20
of curiosity we associate with young children," he said.

Mr Lienlaf added: "I was very surprised by the warmth of their=20
welcome to us. They were very quiet during our reading, although we=20
sometimes saw their playful side."

The paper reports the baboons seemed particularly interested when=20
Guillermo Garc=EDa addressed them directly. "Yesterday, my dear=20
baboons, I had a profound dream. I dreamt that one day humanity would=20
again live in harmony with you," the poet told his audience.

The poetry of Lienlaf and Jorge del R=EDo also provoked a response.=20
During both readings the baboons climbed to the top of their tower=20
and began shrieking.

The seven poets ended with an epic poem. Mr Zurita said: "There was=20
certainly a profound silence during that piece. At least that's how I=20
remember it."

Senghor, poet & statesman, co-founder of the Negritude movement & first
President of independent Senegal dies at 95. Below, the intro to the
Negritude section of POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM vol.I by Jerry Rothenberg &
myself, but first the obit from today's _The Independent_. -- Pierre


THE INDEPENDENT

21 December 2001

Léopold Sédar Senghor, politician, poet and writer: born Joal, Senegal 9
October 1906; Deputy, French National Assembly 1945-58; minister in the
French government 1955-56, 1958; President of Senegal 1960-81; twice married
(one son, and two sons deceased); died Verson, France 20 December 2001.

Poet and president, intellectual and man of action, academic and political
leader, Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal lived a life that was rich in
contrasts. But they were not paradoxes; they were achievements. The man of
many parts was also the man of two worlds and the triumph of Senghor was
that he attained greatness in all that he did.

He embodied the African process of decolonisation. This he defined as "the
abolition of all prejudice, of all superiority complex in the mind of the
coloniser and the abolition of all inferiority complex in the mind of the
colonised". He was the first president of an independent Senegal and he
ruled for 21 years before taking the unusual step in a political leader of
voluntarily resigning, in 1981. He had been re-elected four times.

He was born in Joal, a fishing village on the Senegalese coast in 1906 (or
possibly earlier) and spent his childhood in Djilor, some 20km inland. His
father, a prosperous trader in a poor area, belonged to the Serer ethnic
group; his mother was Fulani. The father, Basile Senghor, had, like other
Serer, converted to Christianity, but he had been polygamous and Léopold was
said to have some two dozen brothers and sisters, and probably more. Léopold
was his Christian name, Sédar his Serer name.

The area was changing. The ground-nut trade had developed, particularly with
the construction of railways. Among the inhabitants there was the interplay
of paganism, Islam and Catholicism, as there was the coming together of
Fulani, Mandingo, Serer and other groupings. Senghor was sent to the
missionary school but his Fulani uncle had a great influence on him, and he
never forgot the folklore that he learnt from him, with its beliefs in the
enchanted domain, the soul of the village, the moment of the spirits and
what he later called, in one of his poems, "the hour of primary fears".

He always remained profoundly African, and, when as a highly educated and
experienced man of 40 he achieved fame, it was as one of the apostles of
"negritude". He was often presented as the founder of this movement,
although Senghor said that this was the Martiniquais poet Aimé Césaire (as
he put it, "we must render unto Césaire the things that are Césaire's"). At
all events, he was one of the most effective spokesmen in presenting the
message of "negritude" which was that black civilisation, especially
African, had its values, its achievements and its aspirations. Here, above
all, Senghor was conscious of what he called "mon ethnie, ma nation".

But he was also a Frenchman. Educated at the Lycée Louis le Grand and at the
Sorbonne, he taught in French lycées. When he entered the classroom at Tours
for the first time he said to his pupils, "I am black. Let's spend the next
few minutes in silence so that you can look at me and see how black I am.
Then we can get on with our work." In the Second World War he served with
the French army and in 1940 he was taken prisoner. A German wished to shoot
him simply because he was black, but was restrained by a French soldier. In
his prisoner-of-war camp near to Poitiers, Senghor listened to de Gaulle's
broadcasts from London and helped a number of Breton soldiers to escape, for
which he was punished until a French military doctor conveniently found that
he was suffering from a tropical disease.

In 1944 he was appointed to a Chair in the University of Paris. He was
elected deputy from 1945 to 1958, he served as a minister in the government
of Edgar Faure, from 1955 to 1956, and in General de Gaulle's first ministry
of 1958. He was a schoolfriend of Georges Pompidou, and was greatly admired
by Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1984 he was elected to the French Academy. After his
retirement he went to live with his second wife Colette Hubert, the
granddaughter of a French marquis, in the village of Verson, just outside
Caen. As Senghor himself put it, he had added "normanditude" to negritude.
At his burial, he said that he would like Gregorian chants to accompany him.
On his 90th birthday, as the masses celebrated in Senegal and the powerful
celebrated in Paris, the people of Verson had decorated their streets and
shops, the schoolgirls sang songs in celebration and the mayor had made a
speech. What could have been more French?

Senghor built his strength in Senegal with his Bloc Démocratique Sénégelais,
which attracted the rural vote. His two principles for independence were
that there should not be a complete break with France, and that the
independence of the African states should not lead to the Balkanisation of
the African continent. The first wish seemed to be met by de Gaulle's idea
that the Fifth Republic should extend to a Franco-African community.

The second was met partially by de Gaulle's reluctant acceptance of a union
between Senegal and the former French Sudan (it was said that de Gaulle was
fascinated by the rare perfection of Senghor's spoken French). But the
Franco-African community disappeared as each state demanded full
independence and the Mali Federation, as the union of Senegal and the
ex-Sudan was called, split up after only two years.

Senghor gave priority in his government to rural reform, to the
establishment of a multi-party system and to promoting a moderate socialism
that could be mid-way between capitalism and communism. His principles were
always democratic although it was by decree that he ordered that French
should be taught. He was not successful in preventing the formation of a new
élite in Senegal, which he had observed as being the normal consequence of
independence, and although his country was one of the least tribal of
African states, there were perpetual conflicts with the southern region of
Casamance and with the Muslim groupings which were growing in importance at
the time of his resignation. There are areas where his government could be
criticised, but in general his success was worthy of his wisdom and
determination.

Prologue to Negritude [From POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM]

        As for artistic creation, we have no lessons to receive from anyone.
(Léopold Sedar Senghor)

        Put up with me. I will not put up with you.  (AimÉ CÉsaire)

        Although the term nÉgritude first appeared in AimÉ CÉsaire's 1939 poem
Notebook of a Return to the Native Land, the movement as such — & the
constellation of its political & poetic concerns — had begun to take shape
around 1931, when CÉsaire met LÉopold SÉdar Senghor in the LyÉe
Louis-le-Grand in Paris & was introduced to modern European literature, to
the writers of the Harlem Renaissance, & to the radical reevaluations of
African sources by cultural thinkers such as the German ethnologist Leo
Frobenius. In 1932, Caribbean students with communist & surrealist
affiliations brought out the single issue of a small, radical magazine,
LÉgitime DÉfense (the title borrowed from AndrÉ Breton), violently
denouncing both Martinican society & Caribbean literature's servile
imitation of colonial models. Two years later, CÉsaire, Senghor and LÉon
Damas founded L'Etudiant noir, with the declared intention of bringing
together African and West Indian students, while laying out the groundwork
for the concept of negritude. Out of a sense of “panic-stricken despair”
(Senghor's words), came the desire “to divest ourselves of our borrowed
attire — that of assimilation — to assert our being, that is to say our
negritude.” In terms of an actual practice, this meant the replacement of
earlier French models by a poetics of the present (Surrealism on the one
hand, African-American figures such as Langston Hughes [below, p. 000] and
Claude Mac Kay on the other), & by an insistence on African art & oral
poetry as more accurate models for poets & artists newly aware of their
origins & trying to escape what Damas called “tracing paper” poetry.
Negritude, understood thus was, in Clayton Eshleman's words, “a
parthenogenesis in which the poet must conceive and give birth to himself
while exorcising his introjected and collective white image of the black.”
Its derivation — from ngre, roughly the equivalent of English “nigger” —
indicates a further defiance of the politesse of racism & race.
        While the term negritude has been used to encompass much pre-CÉsairien and
even some non-francophone work, its hard core & essential moves are best
located in the work of the poets active in it from the start. Of these,
CÉsaire is doubtless the strongest and most virulent presence — a likely
result of his double exile, not only as a member of a colonized society, but
of a people displaced by slavery from the lands of their ancestors. This
difference helps to explain the explosive violence pervading his work on the
level (at least) of his language in which (thus Eshleman & Annette Smith as
CÉsaire's principal translators) "he wants to marronner, to run away from
accepted French poetry, as the maroons ran away from their masters," to
create in its place "a poetry that arises from an earth that is not only
composed of a geological fundament but of the rotted corpses of fallen
runaway slaves." If Senghor, colonized but firmly rooted in the country of
his birth (of which he would become the first President after Senegal's
independence), was able to use a more classical French language & rhetoric
to present materials drawing on his African sources, CÉsaire had to
(re)invent both his language & culture so as to create his identity as man &
poet. By doing so, he inscribed himself indelibly in the dark lineage of
"insurrectional" poets & writers, the transgressors & voyants who include
Sade, LautrÉamont, Rimbaud, and Bataille, because, as he himself says, "our
heritage is one of fevers, of earthquakes; and poetry... must never cease to
lay claim to it: with its raven-like voice, its voice of Cassandra, of
Orpheus, of violent death."
        For all the importance given to interchanges with the Paris-based
Surrealists (Breton, who prefaced CÉsaire's Notes, recognized him early on
as one of the master poets of the century), Senghor's distinction between a
"natural African surrealism" and a more artificially created European
version is still worth considering. CÉsaire's images, e.g., are never
gratuitously surreal, but always weave a meaningful web of cosmo- &
mytho-logical transformatory activity — a mix of mineral, plant & animal
life, along with the mythemes of both Africa & Europe — in which the
metamorphic violence is a direct reflection of the political condition of
his double exile. The achievement is immense, as Clayton Eshleman has said
of it & him: "To discover a human heart in the center of the natural world
verifies the most profound desire behind CÉsaire's poetry: to once again
place mankind at the heart of the universe." And again: "The prophetic voice
here commands attention with an authority unmatched by any other living
French poet."

I don't have anything against Ashbery.  Really.  I like Ashbery...  I took
(not the small exclusive class but the big lecture) Modern Poetry in college
with Kenneth Koch, so naturally we read Ashbery.  Actually, that was the
worst part of the course.  Koch said illuminating things about everyone from
Emily Dickinson to Wallace Stevens, but once he started with the New York
School, all he could say is (drawling) "Frank wrote this....on the
beach.....at Fire Island.....it was a really nice....weekend" etc.  So I
didn't learn anything I couldn't figure out on my own about NY School
writing, and i coudn't figure out much because I had only just barely
started reading poetry the summer before I took that course.

I have a very old book of Ashbery's Selected Poems (1985) and Flow Chart and
Girls on the Run.  I have others but they are in boxes in my uncle's storage
area since I am living with my father now and don't have room for all my
books and didn't even get to choose which ones myself.  (sob story)  I've
read much of the selected poems volume, and I keep trying to read Flow
Chart, but I never get terribly far, although I like it just fine.  I just
don't know how to approach it _as a long poem_.  I expect a long poem to be
something other than a bunch of poetry which could be cast as shorter poems
in a collection.  I think I keep getting trapped because I am subconsciously
looking for a narrative and there isn't one.  I don't think there has to be
one, but the poem starts out as if it is a Dante-esque epic about going to
the underworld:

        Still in the published city but not yet
        overtaken by a new form of despair, I ask
        the diagram: is it the foretase of pain
        it might easily be?

I really like thise lines but I am being taken for a ride by them...
Actually, as I flip through the book, I can see that it's clearer and easier
than I remember, probably because my earliest poetry reading was all
Formalist stuff and I didn't understand poems that didn't make sense in a
literal way, but now I've gone over to the other side, as it were, and I've
been reading Language poetry, which often has much less that a naive reader
can easily grab on to.

Actually, all the apparent difficulty of contemporary poetry goes away if
you start looking at it with the question "Hey, how did he do that and what
effect did it have?" (assuming the poet is a he) rather than "what did that
mean?"  Not everything in a poem "means" something, but everything in a good
poem produces some effect on the reader that the poet wants to produce.  Or
you can privelege the individual reader and talk about how the poem _is_ the
effect it has on each reader, and all the readers are different etc. etc.
(PS I only play at being totally naive.  You can tell by the fact that I
used "privelege" as a verb. Normal people don't do this.)

It did take me a long time to learn that poetry doesn't have to make sense,
though, embarrassingly so.  I had always known that about particular poems I
knew before I went to college.  I had read some Eliot poems and liked them
but I was still messed up by the seventh grade English teacher who would
pass out Robert Frost or Theodeore Roethke poems (on dittos.  remember
dittos?) and make us find all the "symbols" and what they meant, as if the
poem were a cryptic crossword which you had to be able to decipher and once
you did decipher it, you'd get some empty, banal philosophical statement.
(It can be argued, of course, that Robert Frost poems really are empty and
banal...)  The creepy thing about the seventh grade approach is that it
warped you more if you were a good student.  I mean I dutifully destroyed
poems just as I was told to do and "learned" the teacher's lesson well. If I
had been throwing paper airplanes in the back of the class, I might have
been an eleven year old poet with cystic fibrosis way ahead of my
years....ops...wrong thread....

Are there any programs which educate high school English teachers about
poetry so they don't ruin it for their students?  I have heard of "Poets in
the Schools" but usually they teach the students.   But the students usually
have no preconceived notions whereas it's teachers who have it all
ass-backwards.  When I was a math person (I got as far as math grad school),
I attended a conference which had a track for teachers and we were supposed
to be teaching them what real math is like and how it's exciting unlike what
we had in high school, but  we found the teachers to be pretty unteachable.
Not because they weren't bright enough (the conference funded the teachers
to attend and it was in a really nice setting at Amherst College where you
could go hike in the woods) so the program for teachers was quite
competetive to get accepted into), but because they really had this
ingrained view of what and how things should be taught and they kept saying
that they, and not mathematicians, were the experts on teaching math (!).  I
imagine the same thing might happen if poets tried to teach teachers about
poetry from a poet's point of view, making use of current schools of poetry
and keeping Robert Frost in the drawer where he belongs...

Of course, it's obvious (and not really so subtle) that the
corporate-bureaucratic system has fixed on this kid as a quick way to make a
buck. I would think playing on the compassion of the general public as a
rather risky gamble, myself, but hey. However, just because they're playing
upon "our compassion" doesn't mean that compassion in itself is a bad thing.
I'm glad the corporations are mixed up with this kid--maybe it means they
might actually have to put their money where their mouths are and build
disabled-access to their buildings, or sponsor some scientific research into
his disease or something like that.

I certainly don't mean we should all send him letters praising him as the
next Gertrude Stein, just because he's young and ill, but I wouldn't pass on
to any 11-year-old--healthy or not--the kind of "criticism" this kid's been
receiving on this list. I would rather see a critique of the corporate
system selling off his efforts, than raging at the person-process-poetry
him/itself.

If you know how to recognize printed poetry ("a visual
pattern or arrangement, … line lengths, … indentations
from the left margin"), you're doing a better than a
lot of critics and the editors who get it into print!
:)

George Butterick, in his introduction to Charles
Olson's ~Maximus Poems,~ (Butterich did the posthumous
redaction) says that it was very difficult to decide
whether many pieces of paper were fragments of poetry
or were prose ~notes~ that Olson had made to himself.
And hence not included in the volume.

Or F.A.O. Matthiessen, the critic perhaps
single-handedly most responsible for getting Melville
and the American Transcendentalists into the canon. He
has an essay where he's discussing Walt Whitman and,
in making a point, he presents what we take to be
unmistakably Whitman's lines, the long lineation, and
even the diction and tone. Matthiessen's curious
"trick", next, was to ~"reveal"~ that what was just
read was prose by Thoreau, re-lineated by Matthiessen

The problem with the print cues you're talking about
is that there's a whole bibliography of 20th/21st
cent. poetry that is made up entirely of pre-existing
prose imported over into lineation: the John Adams
Cantos of Pound's, ~beautiful~ poems by Ronald Johnson
(who also did "concrete" poetry), etc., etc. (The
Cantos' Adams material can be excruciatingly prosaic,
and that may even have been Pound's point: to  set up
a polyphony between the "sublime" lines of his own
composition
and the raw American Founding Fathers language.)

~Has~ prose "become" poetry by being transferred over
into a poetry frame and re-lineated? Is it no longer
prose, although letter-for-letter identical, once
those spacings have been added?


And you're leaving out prose poems.



The in-person cues ("a spotlit area; a microphone;
chairs arranged in a room pointing towards the
performance area; a person holding an opened book or
papers") are basically the same cues used for stand-up

comedians (and the difference there becomes even
vaguer in "Slam" poetry settings, where getting a
laugh [audible audience reaction] is a sign that the
poem is working

How do those in-person "stimuli" differ from the
set-up for a lecture?



As far as the phonological ("the poet's projected
voice (not normal speaking voice)"), in New York City,
at least, part of John Ashbery's widespread influence
is the famously flat, unaffected, and quotidian voice
he reads in. There are still semi-incantorial poets
who appear here, certainly, but ~most,~ I'd say, have
borrowed Ashbery's style of dry, undramatic reading,
normal speaking voice. No phonological change of tone.



I'm not saying that the cues aren't factors. What I'm
responding to is any assumption, in preceding on to
the "challenge" of web poetry, that real world poetry
is already a done deal, clearly recognizable and
solved.

On web especially, but in general, remember: those
cues pretty much ~always~ follow after an a priori
"announcement" or declaration of some sort that what
you're about to read/hear is poetry (a Dewey decimal
number, a Poetry section in a book store, the flyer
for the event, an introduction by the series curator
that says "PN's poetry  has appeared in . . ."):
meta-. On web, the categorization ("key word") may be
even stronger.


If none of those cues are definitive, sufficient, or
conclusive to poem-ify text (as I think you'll
discover on re-examination), then they may operate
only by ~overdetermination.~ (It takes two points to
demarcate a line; three points along the same line are
overdetermination.)


I hope this helps.

Of the Latter Days and what you might hear


And of unto your inner worlds, where you must die. It makes no difference,
whether you make peace. And of course one always hopes that embracing the
worst, overcomes. And of course that is a myth. We have not escaped the
fire, to speak.

Do not make peace. For whom shall you make peace. Do not seek your hearts.
For whom shall you seek your hearts.

...

This is temporary. You may not receive this. You may receive this only on
a temporary basis. With the proliferation of small-scale nuclear devices,
the Internet is in imminent danger of collapse. There may be days, weeks,
months, a few years, left. This is the end-game of culture. Your knowledge
is useless. Don't fret our media.

But it is a privilege to read this. It is a privilege to witness the
curtain coming down on the future. It is a privilege to recognize that
little will remain on the other side - that later, much later, something
else might inscribe similar words to these.

Later, much later, something else might read them, but not these, but
others.

There are too many bombs; there is the untoward simplicity of the bomb. It
is human to hate, human to take out one's enemy at the risk of one's life.
Sacrifice is the core and kernel of being human; hate is the shell that
derives destruction.

These lines are written between one destruction and another, between one
and another finality. They are produced on the road to another's paradise
and the dissembling of our own.

...

The world frantically holds peace concerts. The world frantically produces
beautiful music reaching throughout heavens and earths. The world produces
books, fashion, songs, operas, magazines, articles, psalms, poems, epics,
sculptures, paintings, puppet-shows, cinema, theater, whole literatures,
all in the name of peace. The world produces screams, terrors, whimpers,
moans, cries and whispers, all begging for peace, caterwauling for peace,
yelling for peace.

Human beings scurry in all directions. Plants burn. Rivers burn. Animals
are blinded. Lesions develop. There are rumors of bombs. There is no
electric. Servers and routers are silenced.

I will stand up and sit down. I will be the prophet of the last and latter
days. I will type on dying keyboards, dead laptops. My words are the words
of truth. My words die from crippled fingers. My words die in ten throats.
My words die in one. My words are lesions.

...

Countdown. This is written from the future to the past. This has already
been written. This will already have been written. This will already have
not been read.

Not by us. Not by something else.

Listen: We are all dead. Listen: It is too late now. The poison is here.
Listen: It is time to make our peace. Listen: It is time to listen to
ourselves. This is the end of the sentence to which we are sentenced.

No one will make peace. No one will listen to another. It is the nature of
being human. It is human to hate. It is human to act on that hate. We will
dance until we are burned alive. We will dance with our lesions. We will
dance and destroy. We will go to heaven. We will take you with us.

It takes only one. Technology: It takes less than one. One minus one is
zero. It will take nothing. It will take nothing at all.

Hello Pakistan will you not listen to us. Give us your weapons. Hello USA
please listen to us. Give us your weapons. Hello India, Israel, China,
France, Germany, Belgium, England, Russia, Sumer, Latvia, Babylonia, Chad,
Japan, Italy, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Canada, give us your weapons.

We will take your weapons and we will beat them into weapons. We will take
your weapons and we will make a column of ash and smoke, fire and debris,
radiation and cloud, from pole to pole, an axis of fury, an axis of death
and destruction. We will cleanse the earth. We will boil the oceans. We
will flood the lands. We will freeze the oceans. We will burn flesh. We
will fuck our enemies. We will arrive in paradise. We will arrive in
heaven. We have removed our enemies. We have removed your enemies. We do
this out of our own goodwill, out of the hearts of men. We do this out of
kindness and charity. We have removed their hearts.

...

But we write between one destruction and another. At the risk of boring
you: We write between one destruction and another. We write into the air
air we breathe. We write through the slaughter, onslaught of lesions
always already among us. We write through our sickness. We write for the
decades of routers and servers. We write for the years of wireless, months
of optical, weeks and days of pdas, minutes of broadband, seconds of
remaining life. We write for audience of one, for audience of one-half,
for audience already tending towards zero. We write for the terror among
us and the success of that terror, and its end.

We write for an improbable length. It takes nothing. It takes nothing at
all.

We write for our lesions, our implacable hatreds. It takes nothing. It
takes nothing at all.

We write in order to kill. We write against one another. There is no other
writing. We write the enunciation of slaughter. We write its emancipation.

We write in order to be silenced. We write in order to be successful. We
are successful. We write for an irrational number.

It is a matter of time; it is a matter of nothing else. And we write for
the silence to follow. We are at the end of days. We are of the end. We
are the meat of the end, the flesh of the end. We are of the flesh and its
lesions.

We are not improbable. We are not improbable at all. We are most probable.
Of this I am sure: We are most probable.

It takes nothing. It takes nothing at all.

L=E9opold Senghor Dies at 95; Senegal's Poet of N=E9gritude

By ALBIN KREBS

New York Times


L=E9opold S=E9dar Senghor, a poet, professor, philosopher and statesman =
who
became the first president of Senegal when it gained independence from
France, died yesterday at his home in Normandy. Mr. Senghor, one of the
central figures in the political upheaval that led to freedom for
France's African colonies, was 95.

His life was a blend of African and European experiences. In World War
II, he fought in an all-African French Army unit and spent two years in
a Nazi camp after being captured. In 1984, he became the first black
member of the French Academy. In between, he served as an always
eloquent, often critical spokesman for the cause and culture of Africa.

"I wear European clothing," he once said, "and the Americans dance to
jazz which derives from our African rhythms: civilization in the 20th
century is universal. No people can get along without others."

The current president of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, announced the death to
a summit meeting of West African nations in Dakar, Senegal. President
Alpha Oumar Konar=E9 of Mali, speaking for the 15 leaders there, hailed
Mr. Senghor as a "great politician and great African."

President Jacques Chirac of France yesterday mourned Mr. Senghor as a
historic figure for Africa. "Poetry has lost one of its masters, Senegal
a statesman, Africa a visionary and France a friend," he said in a
statement.

Mr. Senghor's career was studded with paradoxes. He was a Roman Catholic
who led a predominantly Muslim nation, a sophisticated scholar who drew
his primary support from peasants and a poet who wielded political power
with great skill.

Among African leaders, Mr. Senghor was the chief theoretician of
n=E9gritude, or "blackness," his definition for the common culture and
spiritual heritage of the black peoples of Africa. In one of his
earliest poems, "Totem," he wrote:=20

I must hide in the intimate depths of my veins

The Ancestor storm-dark skinned, shot with lightning and thunder

And my guardian animal, I must hide him

Lest I smash through the boom of scandal.

He is my faithful blood and demands fidelity

Protecting my naked pride against=20

Myself and all the insolence of lucky races.

Mr. Senghor was also an eloquent diplomat, who on the one hand deftly
criticized the colonial policies of Portugal and South Africa, while on
the other scolding some developing nations for what he considered their
hypocrisy. At the United Nations in 1961, for instance, he noted the
double standards applied by some nations newly rid of colonialism.=20

"We have denounced the imperialism of the great powers only to secrete a
miniature imperialism toward our neighbors," he said then. "We have
demanded disarmament from the great powers only to transform our
countries into arsenals. We proclaim our neutralism, but we do not
always base it upon a policy of neutrality."=20

Mr. Senghor was born Oct. 9, 1906, in the small Senegalese coastal town
of Joal. His father was a prosperous peanut planter and trader who had
20 children. His mother, a Roman Catholic, had him educated at a nearby
Catholic mission and seminary and nurtured Mr. Senghor's first ambition
=97 to become, as he recalled many years later, "a teaching priest to =
work
toward the intellectual emancipation of my race."

When he turned 20, however, Mr. Senghor abandoned his calling to the
priesthood and transferred to secondary school in Dakar. In 1928 he won
a partial scholarship that permitted him to study at the Lyc=E8e
Louis-le-Grand at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he formed a lifelong
friendship with Georges Pompidou, who was later to become prime minister
and then president of France.

During his Sorbonne years, Mr. Senghor said, he also discovered "the
unmistakable imprint of African art on modern painting, sculpture, music
and literature," which confirmed his belief in Africa's contribution to
"the civilization of the universal."=20

In his studies in philosophy, Mr. Senghor originated, with Aim=E9 =
C=E9saire
of Martinique and L=E9on G. Damas of French Guiana, the concept of
n=E9gritude, in part as a proud protest against French rule and the =
policy
of assimilation. N=E9gritude retained a respect for French, European and
Western poetry and political thought, but Mr. Senghor as a young scholar
emphasized the importance of his African heritage and urged his
compatriots to "assimilate, not be assimilated."

His love poems over the years reflected themes of n=E9gritude, dealing =
as
they did with what he saw as the "soullessness" of Western civilization
=97 "No mother's breast. Legs in nylon." =97 and he maintained that only
African culture has preserved a mystic means of reviving "the world that
has died of machines and cannons."

Further, Mr. Senghor believed, the African culture gained strength from
its closeness to nature and its people's ancestors, while Western
culture was out of step with the world's ancient and natural rhythms.=20

In his poetry, Mr. Senghor could sound like Walt Whitman or Robinson
Jeffers. His poems carried a tone of optimism, often of exuberant
celebration, according to critics like Clive Wake and John Reed, who
translated his collected poems.=20

At the Sorbonne, Mr. Senghor was recognized as one of the most brilliant
students, and upon his graduation in 1935 achieved the distinction of
becoming the first African agr=E9g=E9, the highest-ranked teacher in the
French school system. He taught French to French children in Tours.

In 1939, while teaching at another school near Paris, he was drafted
into the French Army, serving in an all-African unit until 1940, when he
was captured by the Germans. During the two years he spent in Nazi
prison camps, he wrote some of his best poems, collected in 1945 in a
volume titled "Chantes d'Ombre."=20

Mr. Senghor returned to teaching and writing after the war, and in 1945
became deputy for Senegal to the French Constituent Assembly.

A year later, he was elected one of Senegal's two deputies to the
National Assembly. Sitting in the legislature for the Socialist Party,
he soon decided that only an African party could adequately represent
African needs. Having founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948, he
ran as that party's candidate in 1951 and defeated the Socialist
candidate for the National Assembly.=20

By the mid-1950's, the French Parliament had embarked on a policy aimed
at giving a large measure of self-government to the African colonies.
Mr. Senghor opposed the policy, believing that it would result in a
proliferation of small, weak nations.=20

Instead, Mr. Senghor favored a federal unity between French Equatorial
Africa and the French colonies of West Africa. Later, he successfully
appealed to President Charles de Gaulle of France for independence, and
Senegal became a republic in 1960. Mr. Senghor was elected its first
president.=20

Late in 1962, he repulsed an attempted coup led by a longtime =
prot=E9g=E9,
Prime Minister Mamadou Dia, ordering his old friend imprisoned for life.
From then on, he tolerated no challenge to his generally moderate,
pro-Western policies.

Mr. Senghor won re-election to the presidency in 1963, 1968 and 1973,
and remained president until his retirement in 1980. The first African
president voluntarily to resign power, he handed the office to his
chosen successor, Abdou Diouf.

As president, Mr. Senghor faced problems common among the emerging
nations of Africa. His country was poor, its resources mostly limited to
fishing, peanut farming and the mining of phosphates. He devoted himself
to modernizing agriculture, with limited success, and tried to combat
the corruption and inefficiency that had become endemic under French
rule.

In foreign policy he was a neutralist, while at home he advocated a
special form of "African socialism," which he said should be devoid of
both atheism and excessive materialism. In contrast to African leaders
who fell under the sway of the Soviets in the cold war, he emphasized
his disapproval of a "dictatorship of the proletariat."=20

In 1946, Mr. Senghor married Ginette =C9bou=E9, the daughter of a =
Guyanese
who was a prominent colonial official in Africa. They had two children
before divorcing nine years later. He later married Colette Hubert, a
Frenchwoman from Normandy, where he spent much of his time after
retirement. The couple had one son, Philippe, who died in an accident in
the 1980's.=20

"Exploring the darker sides of love and salvation"
--------------------

Gone to Earth
By Pam Rehm

Flood Editions, 50 pages, $10 paper

Pam Rehm's poetry, rigorous and delicate, is profoundly serious. "Gone to
Earth," her first book in six years, deals with the stakes of love and
salvation, and their terrible shadows: infidelity, guilt, dispossession,
despair. Published by the new, non-profit, Chicago-based press Flood
Editions, the book begins with the luminous, tentative experience of love and
progressively tracks its darkening. The worshipped beloved has inspired the
condition in which one wants "To be all curiosity":

Naturally desiring

a day with you

That strays into night

The lovely longing and the natural desire etched here do not persist
unmarred; the word "strays" suggests as much, pointing us to the errant
nature of erotic conjunction. We find ourselves, as Keats put it, in the Vale
of Soul-Making: Psyche has made her appearance, has "gone to earth," so to
speak, and her development will not be easy. The biblical and Miltonic notes
amplify from the beginning of the book the resonances of this encounter.
Evoking the language of Paul's promise to the Corinthians that they would see
anew with Christ, this lover sees her beloved "First `darkly'/but then `face
to face.' " Like Milton's Adam and Eve, these lovers are "Shepherded/Out of
the thicket/Hand in hand." If we recall "Paradise Lost," we remember they
were thus shepherded after paradise was lost, when "hand in hand" they took
"their solitary way."

Like Rehm's previous work, including the National Poetry Series award-winning
"To Give It Up," this book is austere and excruciating, yet it is also
profoundly calm. "Gone to Earth" may be the most stringently developed of
Rehm's volumes. Her poems carve out a stillness within the existential domain
of fear and trembling, as the titles of some poems suggest: "The Concept of
Dread," "'We Realize a Guilt . . .'," "Humiliation of the Valley."

Now, this may not sound like your idea of fun, and it's not. But salvation,
at least in an existential key, is not fun, and Eros, as Rehm rhymes and
reminds us, carries his arrows precisely and specifically to wound us. "Until
you're wounded in a single spot/Permanently/no impression is made." This is
not the Horatian or Arnoldian poetry of "sweetness and light." It is rather a
poetry in the American transcendental line, its brilliant, exacting
foremother Emily Dickinson. The probing intensities of Rehm's lines owe
something to Dickinson, as do, occasionally, her rhythms and diction. What
could be more Dickinsonian than the opening of "The Humiliation of the
Valley":

The compass of the moment

reveals an angle of suspense

Doubtful hope or bliss to come

are the only presentiments

pressed heavy in the air

of circumspect

Rehm rarely aims for the stunning, trap-door closures of Dickinson's best
poems, and while she puns and plays and paradoxes ("doubtful hope") she does
not sustain elaborate conceits. Her poetry lacks the metaphysical brilliance
of Dickinson's (Whose doesn't?), but shows an astonishing capacity for
sustained, difficult attention. She is no formalist; she is a poet of the
isolated or paired line, the intermittent stanza and the predicament. She is
not usually a rhymer, although her poems are sonically rich; her lines tend
to pause with the phrase and to be grouped by units of thought.

Rehm's spare statements, microrevisions and repetitions, conceptual puns and
morphemic mutations sometimes put one in mind of the earlier work of poet
Susan Howe, who has long pursued her impressive, sui generis task of fusing
the focus of lyric with a revisionary critique of American history. Rehm's
work comes from a more-intimately excavated place. These poems emerge out of
a relation: the "you" addressed is the beloved, who seems to be a spouse but
is sometimes, perhaps, a god. Several poems undertake a lacerating
self-address. Rehm's precision and her controlled, almost classical
investigation of intimate intensities are sometimes reminiscent of poet Hilda
Doolittle (known as H.D.), from whom she drew an epigraph for the volume
"Pollux." It is important to note that the extremity registered here is not
melodramatic, is indeed hostile to theatricality and to the sentimental; we
are in the presence not of a performance (the weakness of much
postconfessional poetry, with its designs on us) but of a dialogue of self
and soul. We are not held captive to a poet's ego; we are implicitly invited
to follow the movements of mind and heart, a wholly different thing. We are
overhearing, so to speak, disciplined acts of contemplation, the soul
struggling to make itself.

These poems frequently suggest Rehm's profound immersion in sacred language
and liturgical rite, although this semantic domain is often evoked in
ambiguous ways. In "The Concept of Dread," Rehm writes, "Dearly beyond/we are
scattered here today/amongst commodities." Such parody of liturgical formula
("Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today . . ." ) could be insufferable
in large doses; Rehm has the tact to use such techniques sparingly and
effectively.

This is not so much a religious poetry as a postreligious poetry that wishes
to retain and honor the practices of introspection and soul-scrutiny so
central to one vein of radical protestantism. This work commits itself as
well to an inhabitation of uncomfortable psychological and ethical spaces:
what does it mean to love someone before knowing them or oneself, to feel
desire move you in lawless ways, to find oneself geared toward self-abandon
even when one intellectually, ethically, wishes to repudiate those impulses?

To uninitiated readers this may seem to be hermetic or unusually dry poetry.
It is not chatty, narrative, or easily socially located. It is often abstract
and sometimes gnomic. It is a poetry voiced from and to inner spaces. But
this is not an unworldly or escapist book. Its first tart lines set the tone
and the challenge: "A roof is no guarantee/that you'll sleep." And for all
its delineation of a searching, reflective, often-agonized consciousness,
this is also a book that announces and earns such statements as, "Privacy is
not a remedy." It is striking to contrast this with the title of one of Mark
Strand's poems in "Blizzard of One" (1998): "Our Masterpiece Is the Private
Life." The aestheticization of private life is something Rehm never courts;
whether Strand does requires a whole other essay. In Rehm's work, the world
is there, and one has entered it, however obliquely it is registered; and,
more important, the world has entered oneself. "I'm not the world," Rehm
writes, "but its vanity/has a hold on me."

Rehm is deeply interested in the impact of possessions on the inner life; one
of the recurring words here is "possession," in all its varieties: erotic,
material, spiritual. "I feel deaf/inside of possessions," she writes in
"Serving Two Masters." Marx described commodities as very queer metaphysical
things, goods whose value lay not in their use but in their exchangeability.
We might say that Rehm's interest in commodities is similarly metaphysical:

Economic life

will run down blind alleys

a specter

A specter is haunting this book, and if it is not the specter of communism it
is certainly the specter of community, integrity and intimacy in a world
flush with things, distractions and incursions:

We've become separated

by `efficiencies'

Nobody can do anything with

Given the scrupulousness everywhere evident here, Rehm's bald statements and
occasionally unlovely locutions must be seen as intentional, although
"intent" is one of the words and concepts under pressure here (for example,
in the poem "Of Single Intent"--"Free to rest without ambivalence/Intention
is difficult to express"--and later in "Where Oh Where Has My Little God
Gone?"--"I cannot follow any form/of intending/other than a reservation/to
cast my gaze yonder.")

Rehm's register is narrow and deep; this book is more a profound, resonating
tunnel than a variegated display of instrumental virtuosity. It strikes a few
deep notes hard and attentively sits with the over- and undertones. Some may
find this work limited, monotonous, difficult, privatized; there is little
rhythmic variety, less tonal variety and little relief. You may find yourself
crying, "Enough already!" But grace comes to those who seek it and sometimes
to those who don't. Approached in the right spirit, the book will deeply
reward those with the desire and patience to sit with difficult things
expressed through minimalist means. "Love answers need," and so, too, some
poetry.

Hey friends:

I hope you can attend the following special event in New Orleans at the time
of MLA:

Saturday, December 29 3:30-5 p.m.

St. Mark's Community Center
1130 N. Rampart St.
New Orleans, LA

We hope you can join us at this special book publication party and panel
discussion sponsored by LIT CITY.

We are gathering to celebrate the publication of two new books, TELLING IT
SLANT: AVANT GARDE POETICS OF THE 1990S, ed. Mark Wallace and Steven Marks
(University of Alabama Press) and SPIN CYCLE by Chris Stroffolino (Spuyten
Duyvil).

Along with the publication party, this event is going to feature a panel
discussion on questions surrounding avant garde poetics of the 1990s.

Likely panelists include:

Charles Borkhuis
C.S. Giscombe
Jefferson Hansen
Juliana Spahr
Chris Stroffolino
Mark Wallace
Elizabeth Willis


Each panelist will be speaking for 5-7 minutes on issues they feel are of
importance to understanding avant garde poetics of the 1990s, and then we'll
open up a general discussion on the topic for both the panelists and the
audience. We'll just talk for as long as makes sense to us, then turn it into
a party whenever we feel like we're done.

If you have any questions, let me know. I really do hope to see you there.

Sincerely,

Mark Wallace

Hey all.

Check out the latest in laser poetry and/or cyber
fiber.  It's Puppy Flowers, the new webjournal with
the really smart name.  In addition to wonderful
contributors (really fantastic!), there's also art to
warm the heart, and a limited time only jingle that
will lull even the most disheartened into grinning
passivity.  You ask "Where did this supra-hybrid of
the ecstasies spring from and why am I not abreast of
its buzz?"  Well, it looks like a great beaming
triangle of yellow light that stretches from San
Francisco to New York to St. Paul and back to San
Francisco again, and its sticker campaign has only
made it to the bathrooms and public transportation of
the Bay Area thus far.  Don't lose anymore valuable
time:

Transpacific Displacement: Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual
Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature

by Yunte Huang, now out from the University of California Press

"Yunte Huang has produced a fascinating study of the transformation of
poetics texts, in this case
Chinese ones, at the hands of American scholars, editors, translators, and
especially poets.  Huang
understands that there is no such thing as a 'translation' that is 'true'
to the original; there are only
better and worse-case scenarios....Whether the work in question is
nineteenth-century ethnography,
Pound's 'Cathay', the fiction of Maxine Hong Kingston, or the 'pidgin' of
John Yau, this brave and highly
original study is sure to raise controversy."   --Marjorie Perloff

"'Transpacific Displacement' is a lucid and insightful study of the
intertextual travel embedded in texts
of modern American literature.  Huang opens an entirely new discourse on
bilingualism and biculturalism
that hitherto has not been thought of in the fields of American modernism
or Asian American
literature."   --Leo Ou-fan Lee


Yunte Huang takes an original "ethnographic" approach to well-known
American texts as he traces the
transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century
America's imaging of Asia.
Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
"Transpacific Displacement" opens
with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and
Amy Lowell.  Huang goes on
to address early ethnographies of Asia, racist representations of Asians in
contemporary pop culture, the
countermockery of literary Orientalism by Asian American writers, and
textually homogenizing tendencies
in Maxine Hong Kingston's work.  He ends with a study of American
translations of contemporary Chinese
poetry.  Articulating a vision for the future, "Transpacific Displacement"
calls for an American literary tradition
rooted in transnationalism and translingual practice.

I think the Ashbery poem _is_ moving.  My problem is that I don't understand
how he achieves this.  I think this is why Ashbery is sometimes thought of
as a "difficult" poet, when he is in fact a relatively easy poet to read and
enjoy since he uses simple enough language and doesn't allude to an
excessive amount of outside sources without which the poems can't be
understood. But therein lie the difficulties.  With some poets, it seems as
if you have analyzed them (but maybe this is an illusion) when you have
provided glosses for obscure language, including, perhaps, references to
literary sources who used those words first or most famously, when you have
filled out all the references to mythology, when you have noticed that there
are five or six words which all are part of the same "symbol" (like words
about sailing or words about trees or words about wood or whatever, and then
you complete the symbol by stating the poem is comparing the governance of
the soul to sailing a gallion in the main).

None of this is possible with Ashbery (nor is it possible with many current
poets).  You can't generalize about symbols because each object tends to
appear only once.  You can't find a narrative thread because any one verse
has a narrative feel to it (the verse, or sentence, may tell quite clearly
"what happened") but the next verse or sentence seems to be about different
people in a different place.  You can't break it into several strands where
each strand tells a continuous story (like the beginning of The Wasteland,
where one strand is the women in the bar, to whom the barman is saying,
"Hurry up please, it's time" (of course this line was designed to resonate
all over the poem, but literally speaking, it belongs in the bar))  You
can't interpret the narrative(s) as symbolic trips or dream-trips all
undertaken by the same person, because they are so clear and plain and just
don't seem dreamlike.  There is no obscure language to gloss.  The literary
allusions are rare and not too obscure or else they even announce themselves
so you don't have to look them up.

In other words, it seems like the Ashbery poem resists the kind of close
reading that one is taught to do in some places. (I attended high school
partly in France, and the Explication de Texte is still a big thing there,
as it was in the French Department in college among the older professors.
However the younger French professors were more into X-Theory, where X could
be Feminist or Queer or Postcolonial, etc., and the X-Theory rests upon
Structuralism and Semiotics and Deconstruction which I have never properly
understood)  I unfortunately understand better how to do the close reading
thing than whatever one has to do to understand contemporary poetry, despite
reading a lot of contemporary poetry and having a sense of which poets I
like (I am trying to figure out why), and even writing poetry which I hope
is contemporary in the sense of not seeming like an imitation of something
I've read and have Closely Read, (in order to figure out exactly where to
put in the obligatory reference to the death of Agamemnon :-) I did write
one poem that mentions the death of Agamemnon, but it is a cut-up, and thus
not very susceptible to being Closely Anythinged.)

I hope that an honest admission of ignorance as I made above won't get me
flamed.  This list scares me a bit.  It seems as if it is dangerous to be
stupid here.  I was legitimately worried about the last post, in which I
argued tat the Merril was more prescise than Ashbery and used an Ashbery
fragment by switching the words around and seeing what happened and was
grateful for the non-flamey nature of the reply.  I realized about the
minute after I posted that my argument was pure sophistry (almost
literally).  I was just desperate to start the conversation going on some
actual test of Merrill and Ashbery, rather than remain in the abstract, and
I wanted to show that they aren't comparable poets.  They may well be
comparable in _value_ (whatever that means), but what they did to language
was so different.

When I read Merrill, I find myself noticing the _words_, thinking, usually
about ordinary enough words (Merrill isn't precious) "that's just right".  I
imagine him putting together woprds like the pieces of the wooden puzzles he
put together as a child, as described in one of his early poems.  When I
read Ashbery, I find the words to be transparent.  I think I am reading
something that is gripping, contemporary, and totally realistic-- from a
different universe.  I don't notice how the words sound, except that nothing
stands out, and if I think about it, I realize that in order to create that
effect, the poet does have to put the words together very carefully.  But
the striking thing seems to be the image, and in some cases the emotion it
produces, all without anything in the real world corresponding to Ashbery's
phrases.  For instance the beginning of Flow Chart is gripping.  When it
starts, we are "Still in the published city..."  (How can a city be
published?  Why were we there in the first place?  And why are we leaving?
These questions do not occur as I read...)  A few lines later, he refers to
"an emptiness/so sudden it leaves the girders/whanging in the absence of
wind,/the sky milk-blue and astringent...."  Now I have no idea what Ashbery
is referring to by this and there are few clues in the text, but like all
good literature, it can be used as a mirror upon which to project one's own
life so as to see it more clearly, and I know I have seen that astringent
sky...

I think Ashbery has had more influence than Merrill, given the direction
thet contemporary poetry has taken, and this is probably a good thing, as
Ashbery is a somewhat more democratic poet.  You don't have to study him to
enjoy him.  I think he is more the heir of Whitman than of Wallace Stevens,
for example.  Ashbery's style is perhaps more of an innovation, especially
at the time he started writing, but I don't think his poems differ that much
from one-another in basic style.  Merrill seems to have tried everything.
Sometimes he failed utterly and sometimes he came up with miniature
masterpieces.  I am eager to get the new Collected Merril so I can see _all_
the poems.  I don't know if the ones left out of the Selected are failures
or simply poems which didn't fit the tone of the individual volumes he
published.

P.S.  I just bought and have read some of Charles Bernstein's With Strings,
but I know he is here, so I probably won't dare to make remarks about it,
naive or not, except that obviously, I liked the poems in it that I read in
the store because I bought the book and not the book by Brenda Hillman (a
poet I have not read) which also looked good or the book by Cole Swenson
(ditto, different style, though), or the new James Tate (I am a little
disappointed by the ordinary realism of the poems in it that I've glanced
over; I hope I'm wrong.  Didn't it win the Pulitzer?  Shroud of the Gnomes
and Worshipful Company of Fletchers were so pleasantly weird that I hope he
hasn't switched to being a realist...)

Unless a writer has read a lot of their precursors and contemporaries and
readds widely they wont be any good unless its a fluke. Of course there's
nothing wrong with a kid writing poetry: it becomes a problem when its
obliquely used by Opprah (who I believe has become a millionnaire by "do
gooding" and woould probably subscribe to an "ooh, isnt it awful, those
lovely towers crashing down: and its  so good now that we the US have
destroyed the eivil dooers and and and ... [huge gushes of tears and outrage
and more oohhing and ahhhhing as another daisy cutter bomb lands somewhere
on a whole lot of wogs thank God and God bless Ameriky and then Wolf Man
comes on and says "See!" Didnt I warn ya?Dont mess with Ameriky...Turn on
the spigots boys..." and so on] ..and he (not Wolf Man) goes on Television
and its like the Aristotelian theory of catharthis: we all feel so much
better no: we can live with a spastic or some dying kid its so emotional and
he writes "pomes"  Ooh!!  All by himself ...
  Look if we really subscribed to the concept that each individual is
valuable we would encourage individuals everywhere to be quietly happy about
who and what they are: the boy's parents in my opinion would be wise to keep
him off television - especially Opprah - (even if he had no physical or
other disabilities) its bad news needing other people to approve or not of
what one write, paints...anything one does.generally poets that we  mostly
concur are "significant" are, or would mostly be, capapble of writing
regardless. yes we should encourage children: but people have to learnt to
take knock backs...I see this going on TV with a disability as an example
(mostly) of the "poor old me" syndrome  which is really a long winge by the
person or persons to get attention (that not always bad on itself) but very
often by people who lack real self-love (as ditinguished from vanity or
arrogance...quite different from someone who goes to a SLAM poetry night to
have a few minutes of fame: the problem is when  you start needing that: if
you can operate without props etc thats great...
  I suspect that the parents of this boy should be careful: ask themselves
whether he's not just being put up for scikly sentimental reasons as a kind
of freak (we all like to watch freaks or things like "The Munsters" or
horror or "The Hunch Baack of Notre Dame" would have far less appeal) ...
but the media, Opprah etc are in it for cash: big cash, they dont care if
you commit suicide the week after the show.
  Thinking about it I'd arther eat a plate of vomit than be on Opprah (money
or not) or even shake her hand.
 Cheers, Richard.

I think part of the problem is that at all levels, it is considered to be
some kind of crime to impose values from above.  I was in an MFA prgram
(Emerson College) which was not that bad. I did nonfiction and poetry for
two semesters and one semester of fiction.  I was hosrrible at fiction, and
got comments from the teacher to that effect.  She would only give A's if it
were publishable.  In nonfiction, I did well, but got a lot of criticism,,
and _some_ people did badly.

However in POETRY, there's this idea that you can't judge someone's
inspiration (or some such nonsense) and EVERYONR did well, regardless of
whether they wrote brilliantly or were the worst poet imaginable.  (One
person was the worst poet imaginable.  I cannot quote but I can tell you
that she distributed her poems on various shades of pink and lavender paper,
in a nonstandard font...)  The problem was not that the teacher was
incompetent; he is the poetry editor of the Atlantic and had a bew volume
out at the time he taught the class.  The problem was that he was hired to
find the good n everything and to never, ever say anything was bad.  This is
called having a supportive atmosphere in grad school :-(

If MFA programs are like this, god knows how acceoting of bad poetry
expensive non-degree courses are, or courses at the Y or at the public
libraries are...  I had taken some classes at Brown's Continuing Ed dep't
prior to enrolling at Emerson, and if anything, they were more challenging.

I actually chose Emerson because they were the only place that would let me
start in January.  But the program is really pretty good in the sense that
it is big and they offer a lot of different classes.  The fiction class I
was terrible at was a really good, challenging class.  It was on the short
short story.  Unfortunately I have zero talent for that and was also
medicated in a way which somewhat precluded creativity...  I was too afraid
of bombing out of grad school again if I ended up at a super competetive
place, and was also attempting to switch from having been a math PhD student
to an MFA in Creative Writing, with  a big gap in the middle, so it wasn't
clear where I'd get accepted.  Because I didn't want to reveal my personal
situation in my writ8ing sample, I sent them a review I did on A. R.
Ammons's book "Glare" which ended up not getting published because I liked
the book and the editor of the online journal I was writing for didn't.

Subject: Re: "New" Poet


Where does mass-culture poetry come from? Is it a
half-digested imitation of "official verse culture"
workshop poetry? Does it come out of what people read in
grade school? School probably has a bigger influence than
OVC, since I doubt Mattie Stepanek, or Jewel, or Henry
Rollins or whatever, read much in the way of Ploughshares
and Grand Street and Paris Review -- but what I think it
really comes out of is the "other tradition" of amateur
versifying that lots of people plugged into as adolescents
and some continued into adulthood, with no real ambition to
be more than amateurs. It's like a kind of folk art, and
the standards for success are different than in OVC or the
classics. The practice is represented now by tons of
websites (www.poetry.com is the motherlode).

This kind of poetry goes on (scads of it really) under the
radar of academics and published poets, having nothing
really to do with that culture -- it's the poetry of
somebody who did well in a creative writing class once,
or, to be less cynical, somebody who gets private
satisfaction from modest practice of the craft (and more
power to them as long as I don't have to read it). The web
is a good place to suss it out, lots of "journals"
that exist solely for the benefit of the writers who get
published in them, not far off from the personal website --
"here's some pictures of my dog, and here's some poems I
wrote about snorkling". But it's interesting -- what does
*that* subculture want from art? One thing it definitely
wants is not to have to know a whole lot about poetry
(technique, tradition, what's cool) in order to write it
and get a little aesthetic buzz, be part of a little (very
unofficial) verse culture, feel like an Artist (because
we're all Artists, deep down, aren't we? I mean, Deepak
Chopra says so). And so that's why Mattie Stepanek is on
Oprah -- because everybody knows about that kind of thing
anyway, knows somebody who writes "a little poetry",
wouldn't know Paris Review (not to mention EPC) if it hit
them in the ass and doesn't care either, and this is just
the kind of poetry they like: easy to understand,
sentimental, chicken soup for the soul. Something almost
anybody could do -- but by some standards a skill anybody
with gumption can learn is the best kind (embroidery, auto
body repair, poetry).

I think what bothers me about Oprah's love affair with the
written word is that it commodifies the practice of
amateurs. They were always there and they didn't need Oprah
until she convinced them they did.

Jeffrey  Etal.. In a way by a poem being (apparently) "not a poem" with
Asbery's flat voice and the cues or clues being more and more enigmatic
might paradoxically heighten its

less certain what is poetry or when poetry is poetry or art or music or
prose or dull Jacksonian politics (as you say a good ploy for contrast etc)
but that uncertainty and the greater "obfuscating" of the clues could lead
to a poetry hich even before it gets to be read is already so irritating

(last one of these sent out in September)


Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                             -05/01/02


My recent work has been dealing with sexuality, terror, death, windows
onto worlds, the confluence of subtropical nature with subsumption neural
architectures.

In Miami, my job has been terminated, the new media line cancelled, the
track itself eliminated. I contain my frustration, writing under the sign
of the repressed.

Below is the usual intro:

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the work; readers
may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing may appear
fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my
end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists, partial or
transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 5000 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Azure,
and Nikuko in particular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, sex,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and prehistory, as well as
the domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on a cdrom of the last eight years of my work
(Archive); I also additional video materials, created with Azure Carter
and Foofwa d'Imobilite, on two cdroms, Baal and Parables. I've worked on a
series of codeworks and political pieces, as well as Asteroids, a group of
videos based on 3d modeling of spatial objects and fly-byes. Finally, I've
recently completed two cdrom collections of materials, Miami and Voyage.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work and possible introduction. It is also helpful to
read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lq, lr)
as well. Skip around. The Index works only for the earlier files; you can
look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

For information on the availability of cdroms containing the text and
other materials (graphics, video, sound, articles, books), see the appen-
ded notice below.

You can find my collaborative projects at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

I agree, personally, that any intersection between poetry & popular
culture bears watching, and not necessarily with a glare. Further, I agree
that in the spirit of "On the Pumice of Morons," the revisions of Little
Nell, typo, I mean Mattie's poem have been more interesting TO ME than the
original poem. Which is terrible. Oh, wait, that word is "trite," isn't
it? Okay: I'll see my own "terrible" and raise myself "barfy."

Personally, being both physically disabled (thankfully, at the moment
not so badly that you'd notice unless you deliberately watched my gait)
and five kinds of certifiable nutbar, I don't want people to look at my
poem and go, "Awww, poor wittle cripple." Don't lay on me the burden of
being some saintly fucking Tiny Tim. If my poem sucks, tell me it sucks.

Criticism is  tricky: educators are right to encourage people and provide a
situation as much as possible where people feel good about themselves: but
if one is doing poetry eg it is probably good to give honest but detailed
comments where those comments are expected. As a person approaches adulthood
(altho one is still sensitive about one's own work) a criticism can be
helpful; its the way its put. I remember my father teaching me water colour
technique when I was about 9 or 10, now he was convinced that I had what he
called "a marvellous colour sense" whereas when I painted I simly put a
colour here another ther more or less as I remembered things were - but
that wasnt too bad but  it embarrassed me how he went around saying how good
an artist I was (would be), but he taught me how to put blues in the
distance, green in the fore-ground etc, have a centre, balance, how to give
a feeling of light (I suppose he was teaching me his own way of painting as
he painted after Turner and others like that ) but the criticism came in the
form of suggestions: I remember working as a tewchnitian and when I made an
error that was matter-of-factly pointed out by my boss (without the sarcasm
or abuse that a lot of foreman reserve for those under them) but I received
sufficient support for acheivements: thats  a good process ... its very hard
to deal with this question as the problem  for a sensitive teacher is "what
is good poetry?"  and you might think you know, but do you (or does one?)
it's problematic: the creative writing schools etc maybe are doing the best
thing by not criticising in the "this is better than that etc sense" and
rather getting the students "into action" showing them this idea: "let's try
this" judgements and negativity are probably superfluous: an example is your
own appreciation of Ammons - who is a poet i like altho I havent read him
for a time - and of course its your or (one's, the individual's) opinion:
but once a poem is published its a fact of life that there simpply ARE
critics out there: the work of building a person needs to have been done
both by that person and parents and so on before they are criticised....its
problematic: but remember that by the time somebody gets so much praise
there on Opprah or whatever its very different: but I think that we do feel
very strongly about things such as our own poetry... I have to admit that
when it comes to that I am still very nervous when I read in public: this
means that I am scared of criticism or disapproval which is probably a hang
over from my school days when people were "dumb" or "morons" and people got
prizes and "failed" certificates or athletics eg School Cert which has now
been done away with was a big bogey for many children, and hence the
approval, instead of coming from within the individual, comes from outside:
which is bad news because if one is dependent on external approval one
collapses (or may collapse) when that approbation is removed.....I just got
beaten in a close chess game and it feels bad: I hate losing!  but the
answer to that is: how long am I to remain upset over that when noboddy else
cares and remaining depressed about a "failure" actually limits one's
abilities to continue in some other endeavour?..its a paradox: to get strong
inside oneself one has to expereince so-called "failure" and even court it
and ride over and through it: as rejection, criticism etc are all constant
but in developing that strength in ourselves or others we need to also give
as many positive messages as possible.
 Maybe the teachers on a creative writing programme should encourage
experimentation and effort while providing examples of a range of other
writers: some criticism of technique toward a particular end if
approriate:but get away from the judgement of the end product.....if people
are motivated to invent or create then they will find their own way
eventually; in  a  sense all poetry IS good as long as the creator of the
poem or work feels good in the process of creation. That's what matters: to
feel good about what one is doing while doing it: even better to be
'passionate' and driven and maybe 'obssessed'..and so on...
 I think however that the Opprah's of this world play on the weaknesses of
people who have because of whatever events in their lives and their own
make-up are unhappy inside themselves: as some one said "she likes sad" ...
but if she gives positive messages that's good: the trouble is that the
world TV film etc is so artificial and full of phonies that my advice to the
parents would be to keep their boy well away from any media exposure.

Millie,

About your response viz. "quality" (points excerpted
below)/"can't judge ... brilliantly/worst poet
imaginable"---

and to conflate that with your other thread abt.
Ashbery/Merrill---



John Ashbery had the reputation for being the most
~generous~ poet anyone would ever meet.


(Harry Mathews brought out that obvious characteristic
of John Ashbery's, in an interview I did with Mathews
in 1988.)


You couldn't show John Ashbery a poem he wouldn't
like, wouldn't find some good in.

And if he ~a priori~ found anything
likeable/attractive about the person, the poem was a
shoe-in.

Any student of his, anyone who encountered him must've
discovered this, I think: there would be a single line
he'd pull out, a single ~word~ ...

("It made me think how many times I read the word
'the' and yet never tire of seeing it"!)

John Ashbery has even said, in interviews, that given
a student who writes in a style he personally doesn't
follow or espouse, such as Confessionalism, he
supported the stud. in trying to write "better"
Confessionalist poems.


There are people, Millie, about whom it's proverbially
cooed, "He never said an unkind word about anyone."
It's not a bad thing to be approving, encouraging, and
nurturing, ---especially where the students are
novices.

Consider: the closer to an "ideal" any writer
approaches embodying (the case with John Ashbery, who
is living paragon to whole generations of imitators
and admirers), the further that writer ~falls short
of~ a Still-Unattainable that's envisioned.

(Another John Ashbery interview where he said Wallace
Stevens used to scare him, because he realizes he'd
never be able to write like that, at that calibre.)


If you're a James Joyce scholar, ~what's the point~ in
even discussing or commenting upon anyone else's
writing, since, on some level, you know that the
entire XXth century (~pace~ Pynchon, et al.) never
did/will never reach that level of "command,"
architecture, diction.

Everybody's a shrimp, when there are giants in the
earth.

Whatever mental list you can count off on your fingers
--- don't give yourself too long or cheat --- of
English language poets you can name from the
~pre-1900s~ millenium is probably about as many poets
who are worth reading that the language produces, and
~at that frequency.~

But we know so many more contemporary poets than we
remember past ones.

The odds of any poem or poet being "supremely" worth
your investment, on some sort of cosmic scale, are
quite slim.

(And we know only Modernists.  What were the libraries
full of early XXth cent. poetry that are never
re-printed...?  Should these people ~have never been
born?~)


So, the rest is just ~your temperament~ speaking, how
~you~ form judgments, whether you form judgments ~at
all.~

As far as your Emerson teacher from Atlantic,
pedagogically there is no evidence that "Spare the rod
and spoil the child" works better in creative writing
classes or MFAs programs.

My education has ~closed me off~ to more poetry than
it has opened me up to.  Indoctrinated taste ~seals
off~ our capacity to take in.

How will red-pencilling a MS and writing "cliche'",
"redundant", "trite", and all the other ~cliche'~
comments that creative writing teachers are
indoctrinated to make,

faster advance students toward some next stage,

than encouraging them to believe there's some kernel
of possibility that continued ~work~ (which takes
place ~on their own,~ to the degree a writer can
tolerate solitude) and guided reading will advance
them toward?

(In ~A Wild Salience,~ a student of Rae Armantrout's
collated the marginal remarks that Armantrout made on
poems of hers in a writing class that Armantrout
taught.)


I think it's long since overdue to place "good,"
"bad," "worst," "terrible," etc., permanently ~under
erasure,~ banned, as terms--- not to enter into the
sort of Flower Children relativism you're talking
about but

~in order to see~ whether you/we can continue to make
the same judgments with more illuminating terms.


"good"/"bad" are ~universalized,~ the way you're using
them, when, in fact, in separate cases different
criteria are being exercised in the judgment.

("This poem isn't very good" = "This poem is using a
limited, 4th grade reading level vocabulary of one-
and two-syllable words, few more than five letters
long"? = "This poem is using a florid, Ph.D. level
vocabulary that forces me to check the dictionary
every other word, if I am to follow any meaning, and
*I don't like* being reminded of what I don't know"? =
"This poem is embarassing frank about private matters
and I'm uncomfortable having such hair-raising
intimacies revealed to me"? = "This poem is Mister
Spock Vulcan in its emotionless, impersonal neutrality
and I believe it needs to be humanized on some level
to have some appeal to any earthling" = "This poem
is..."?)

The "bad" poet you describe who wrote in Gigi and
Kristen fonts on lavender and pink paper ~had a
graphic impulse~ more like a painter or visual artist,


and they might be more helpfully taught by being
directed toward poetry, like --- whatever ---
Apollinaire's calligrammes, Robert Grenier's
caligraphic ink writing, Spencer Selby's collages,
*WILLIAM BLAKE!*, etc., where that secondary impulse
could be cultivated into fuller parity with the text.

Someone --- I forget whom (Blake?) --- said:

"There are no great poets in heaven."

---which I had to have explained to me by the
commentator who quoted it: hierarchies of taste or
importance are not ultimately leveling, a "superior"
poem does not cancel out the appreciability of a
"minor" poem --- and poems appreciated at different
times for different reasons, in one case a sorrowful
Celan miniature because your woundedness is seeking
out its spokesperson, on another night Milton or Pound
because you're more in touch with your multi-leveled
complexity and a sense of history/mythology and need
to be addressed from equally many planes, the next
night a "saccharine" Elizabeth Barrett Browning love
sonnet because ~you~ are lost in sentimentality and
puppy love and at that hour can only understand the
simplistic,...

The pleasures of poetry are not homogeneous.


I think there really needs to be more openness toward
the determinants of transitory ~power~ that are
influencing one's sense of "good"/"bad".

Study of women's poetry written in America before the
XXth century will be reduced to --- whom? --- a
teacupful of two or three poets, at best, unless the
reader can transcend prejudices and unreceptiveness
around rhyme, meter, and sentimentality.

Annie Finch, whose project in other respects I
sometimes diverge from, was quite pioneering and
recuperative in linking the resurgence of "formalism"
to pre-Modernist women's poetry,--- so that by again
reacquiring the lost ~capacity~ to read buh-BUM
buh-BUM buh-BUM buh-BUM "June"/"moon" poetry "breathes
life into" half the population of past poetry.

Your pink and lavender paper poet is much closer and
ready for web publication, where graphics matter more,
than a pure 12 pt. Times Roman font poet.




P.S.  James Merrill's influence is as strong or even
more widespread than John Ashbery's: you're not
considering the counter-reformation of New Formalism,
to which Merrill represents a formalist torchbearer.

"The Gaga Films," by Jennifer


I went to the cinema on the tram down the hill. I often went this way for
other reasons but wasn't sure where I was. I was in company of a couple of
experimental filmmakers. They told me about the place. It was in a clap-
board house remodeled as an underground film venue. It was $15 to get in.
I only had $8 Canadian. I left and came back; I found $14 US. I hoped I
could make up the difference. They were talking about "The Gaga" - the two
films about "The Gaga" - and had I seen them? The films were the most
politically astute of the century. "The Gaga" was also "La Gaga" and I
hadn't seen them. I was missing so much. "The Gaga" wasn't playing that
night.

Interpretation

"The Gaga" is the violent absurdity that drives late-capitalism. "The
Gaga" has always existed, but was quiescent in traditional capitalism -
it could never appear under hierarchy, but only interstitially in the
Network. As the Network grew, through late-capitalism and postmodernity
into terror, The Gaga appeared - first as a peripheral symptom, then
increasingly as an engine driving the whole. The Gaga is a projection,
perhaps derived from Cruickshank's 19th-century Locomotive - "They've gone
loco" - images of the confluence of steam and imperial capital. The Gaga,
like the Japanese Kappa, is a figure at once vulnerable and dangerous. It
is vulnerable because it resides in the Network, a post-Situationist
entity susceptible to major and minor illness or decay - through the
strategic application of hacking and other disruptive techniques. The Gaga
is utterly inhuman, nonhuman, inhumane; all of The Gaga films are in
black-and-white, as if to indicate, from the mode of representation
itself, the structural and nodal nature of The Gaga. The Gaga is most
often described in these films by means of chalkboard lectures, diagrams
in pencil, voice-overs, and talks. Computers and digital effects are
rarely used; they are the centrifugal residue of The Gaga, incapable of
anything more. It seems paradoxical that The Gaga both underlies the skein
and is within it; the skein is its flesh and blood, and a computer repre-
sentation would be nothing more than a desiccated and useless sample of
its tissue. For it is clear that The Gaga is continually in process, that
it participates in the quantum states known as superimpositions, that it
is always extended beyond itself, non-boolean, gestural, genderless. A
feminist professor appears in one of the films, delineating The Gaga,
demonstrating its difference and distinction from a feminist fluidity that
absorbs and gives, breaks down the transitive. She, like all other actors
in these works, is defined as such - "a feminist professor" - in subtitles
that also list "a working-class hero" - "a factory worker" - "a consumer"
- even though an attempt is made, beyond analysis, to develop a romance -
"a lover" - "another lover" - against the constant and broken, jump-cut
description that constitutes the style of the films. The Gaga alone, like
the Virgin of the Virgin Mary, like the sealed womb, is never described,
always clothed in the Network. It is clear that The Gaga is part of the
distribution of the films, that the audience, as in violent pornography,
is implicated, just as The Gaga is implacable. The implacability is
portrayed in terms of gray zones; the black-and-white occupies, for the
most part, an uneasy middle ground, most of the time. There are never any
"true" whites, "true" brightness, in the films; instead, starting from an
upper middle gray, the films descend into murky darkness, as if they were
reproduced several times over, from an earlier, and now lost, model. The
result of all of this is a clear indication that we, ourselves, have lost
the power of brilliance, of brightness, of that clear light permitting
analysis; instead, our theoretical explanations begin in that gray area
where language proliferates, cut off from the clarity of projection and
representation. These explanations likewise descend into darkness, where
they are part and parcel of the substance of the world, where they are
within and without, suffused with The Gaga, from which, like the real
weight of the curtain of iron, there is no escape. It is no wonder that
both films are titled "The Gaga" as well; the resulting confusion in talk
and analysis (some speak of "Gaga A," "Gaga B," "First and Second Gaga,"
etc.) only serves to reconfirm their internal direction. If there is any
brilliance in the world, it is clear, it is to be found in the films
themselves; nowhere else in culture is analysis so devastating, accurate,
and beyond recall. The films are undated; the names of the participants
involved are never given; even their origin remains, not a mystery, but
simply unknown. Go see "The Gaga"; everything else falls, into place.

This helps to account for what makes Ashbery so popular among both "Us" and
"Them" (we all know which particular Us we belong to, right?).

As you say, his poetry resists the "find-the-major-symbols" school of
analysis by refusing to supply coherent narratives, points of view, thematic
focus, etc.  But it does so in part by seeming to _invite_ that kind of
analysis: because syntax, grammar, and that kind of thing is so often
"normal," even "eloquent," in non-_Tennis Court Oath_ Ashbery, the
uninitiated reader will at first invariably _attempt_ to read the poems for
a conventional referential meaning.  I know I did, anyway.  For example,
many of his poems have lots of water imagery, or sky imagery, or
writing-poems imagery, etc.  And in fact Ashbery continues to supply these
kinds of temptations in ever-more complex forms to those determinedly
traditional readers who have already learned his basic tricks but still want
to lobby for his status as a "real" poet.

Just look at at least half the Ashbery criticism out there, and you will see
attempts at exactly what you were saying can't be done: readings that try to
connect symbols, find cloaked narratives, establish a unified speaking
subject, and so on.  The first objection that springs to mind is that such
readings are perverse, but they're really not--the poems are _asking_ to be
treated that way.  You could accuse the poems themselves for being
critically perverse in setting up so many ingenious, perceptive critics.
The most obvious example would be Harold Bloom, with his Romantic
subjective-poet Ashbery, but you could say the same about John Shoptaw,
Leslie Wolf, Fred Moramarco, Charles Altieri, even at times a devout
avant-gardener like Marjorie Perloff.  All these very intelligent critics in
their various ways have set about to demonstrate Ashbery's suitability for
inclusion within a system of canonization and commentary that uses very
old-fashioned New-Critical modes of inquiry.

Furthermore, as I've been suggesting, they frequently meet with a great deal
of success, at least as far as they take their approaches, which is usually
just far enough to stop before they have to take account of Ashbery's
"trick": i.e., that the poems are only pretending to be those kinds of
poems.  (Actually, some of those critics probably acknowledge this, now that
I think of it, so please nobody call me on the carpet.)

But the paradox is that in order to pretend convincingly to be that kind of
poem, it must ... well, _be_ that kind of poem.  So for example, "Self
Portrait in a Convex Mirror" is on one level a poem of meditation about art,
identity, etc., and as such is capable of sending the Harold Blooms and
Helen Vendlers out there into paroxysms of ecstasy.  On another level,
however, it's a pastiche, a blank parody that short-circuits its stabs at
profundity as soon as it makes them, in the _act_ of making them.  This is
even more the case in poems like "Daffy Duck in Hollywood" or just about
anything he's written since 1990: these poems are like little facades set up
in a ghost town, with little signs on them saying "(close-) read me."  And
when you try, you end up realizing that you've only been close-reading the
sign saying to close-read, not the structure behind the sign.

In this respect, Ashbery's poems are different from the other contemporary
poetry you mention.  You're right about those poems: regular close reading
doesn't work with them.  They're made with that futility in mind.  Their
little hanging signs say something like "Don't even bother trying, pal."
Ashbery's, however, are like reversible jackets you can wear to either Iowa
City or Buffalo.

To but in here again: I agree in principal with the gist of  your comments
Jeffrey: Ashbery  (at least everything I;ve heard about him and the way he
(and what he says)) in interviews makes me think him (if witty urbane and
very sensitive) also a positive person: not one to make hurtful or harsh
judgements: I dont know if it was editied but his "Reported Sightings" on
art says nothing bad about anyone: and he has some very interesting and
eclectic interests: John Clare's (prose especially);Charles Ives, Elliot
Carter, Marvell, Raymond Roussell, the way he was reading Milton and then
went to a movie about daffy duck with Frank O'Hara and dreamt Daffy was the
devil: hence the very vital "Daffy Duck in Hollywood", the amazing ability
to pick out Parmigianino's extraordinary painting, the surreal the lyrical
and the quotidian modulated in his work, the sometimes quite amazing twists,
the sense of ongoing ness, nowness, and so on....but Ashbery has been
enormously written about: Merrill is a little more "normative" (if I can
make a classification-generalisation)...

And the concept of directing or encouraging people along lines they like is
excellent: we all start with "trite" or common-a-garden poems  - although
some children -many- seem very creative: there are some extraordinary poems:
in fact I remember when i was "getting back into poetry" about 1988 that my
daughter brought home a painting with faces on titled "The Girl on the
Faces" either a creative error or her way of seeing things any way I turned
that into the beginning of a poem:

  "The girl on the faces is a thousand child."

There I deliberately end-stopped  the "child" and this was long before I;d
heard of language poetry or much of any modern poetry....

However I'm a bit puzzled to your talk about shrimps and giants. Cheers,
Richard.

Bin Laden seems to me  like a prophet... a kind of modern Jesus Christ and
he seems to talk poetically and enigmatically...a kind of gentle and
langorous version of Che Guevara whose book (about him) i carried aroound
and never read: I liked the idea of revolutionaries and revolutions
especially as a 20, 21 year old...never got as far as going to Vietnam like
the young man who joined the Al Qaeda...like Christ he (bin baby I mean)
will  probably inspire a cult which could even turn into a religion: not
sure if I could become a Muslim but I would if Bush and Mr Wolf started a
big campaign against Muslims and banned that religion...mind you I'm a loner
I dont like joining things...just like the idea of big buildings crashing
down and explosions but then I suppose its a left over from watching all
those war movies ( from Amerika) in the 50s eg "The Battle of the River
Plate" (wow one ship coped in the magazine and the whole ship blew up!) and
"To Hell and Back" (with Eddie Murphy) and ones in which the Koreans
(Koreans?) were always the evil slant-eyed ones we loved to see blasted
heroically (heroically?) from the skies (they always flew Migs), and then
those cowboy movies when we always all cheered as children when the cavalry
arrived to save them from the frightening Red Indians, and there was always
Pop Eye with his spinach and The Three Stooges...

But do you think that old bin baby would be interested in me poetry? Anyway
as I say i like the idea of bin Laden: maybe that's all he is, an idea...but
I hope not: could you pass on my regards? Cheers, Richard.

Indeed. once I used to go to poetry workshops at the
Clearfield Public Library, etc., finally I even taught
one through a Community Education program...the Just
Buffalo Literary Center does three open mic readings a
month at which all kinds of poets and of all different
skill levels and experiences read.

and it doesn't really matter that many of them haven't
read a lot of the excellent poetry being *written* in
Buffalo. on the other hand, very few of those poets
left the campus to go to the open mics. so there are
several different Buffaloes, with not too much
mixing...at least not while i was there. (having just
left). (sad. i love Buffalo. under snow though it is.)

well I am not sure if you are being sarcastic here or
not. i think i am with Deepak Chopra. recently I've
been driven to hysterical emotion (I am being quite
serious) by Yoko Ono's music--not the cheesy protest
songs or the Lennon-corrupted attempts at "pop" music,
no I mean the full on Ono-weird moaning and wailing
(specifically, if you are interested, the albums "Fly"
and "Plastic Ono Band")--to me it is about an
individual exploring all strange, unsettling, boring,
cheesy, dissonant and fabulous qualities of her own
individual voice.

in fact, since this has been happening i have been
having a very hard time listening to forms of music
with regular time signatures and scales.

odd.

i'm not one hundred percent clear what all this has to
do with the poetry discussion. oops. well, i knew this
was going to get away from me.

but i guess one thing Yoko actualizes is that everyone
has a generative source they should be reaching for
and developing. sort of regardless of the results.

i admire the point you make re Oprah and commodity of
verse.

i think if Mattie's work--(indeed)--results in more
people writing verse, doggerel, bad poetry, whatever
you want to call it, that is okay with me. i think
that is a positive move for a world in which people
(past Sesame Street anyhow) are solidly alienated from
the sources of their own creativity.

we may discover a way to be less selfish.

        Vernon,

        This is the point that I was hoping would come around. (wait that sounds
snotty doesn't it) I shop'd the Walmart this year and it was great. The
people there are great, looking up to see low brow as entertainment, yes,
but these are the people, the mob. Now Ginsberg's triumph was to open the
modern poem to them. As if I am not one ... But Yes there is a poem,
Virginia. Now how could one get a poetry sponsorship or open reading in the
market place? Would we be shunned like in Footloose and have an angry John
Lithgow say it is anti Christian? Would we be forced to drink hemlock for
teaching in the agora ??? I fine case for agoraphobia. I know I am sounding
like John Dryden here, but how can we open the poem to everyone, and remove
it from the day old bread section??


                            Best, Geoffrey

Elizabeth Treadwell said she shops at Target. This year I did the bulk of my
holiday shopping there, as well. I'm imagining this two-poet Target scenario
expanding like a Nike ad, with numerous poets saying they shop there or
voiceovers announcing "Even the avant-garde finds what it needs at Target."
Now, if only they'd carry some serious literature or sponsor a poetry
series... (dream on)

Beethoven went deaf, Dante was blind, and
according to rumour, so was Homer. There were no
social programs for these people. They do not
continue to be studied over the centuries because
of their "special interest" status, but because
of what they *said*.

I think it is condescending to grant some sort of
special dispensation based on disabilities,
especially in literature, which is arguably one
of the most level playing fields there is.

It is not a question of of conforming to socially
accepted norms. If a deaf poet puts on a
performance for the deaf, they have conformed to
a set of normalised expectations, namely those
within the deaf community.

We seem to have the idea that everyone can and
should be able to do everything. There *are*
things the handicapped cannot do. That's what
*makes* them handicapped!

Were I too lose my arms, legs, hearing and
eyesight in the next five minutes, I would still
expect that anything I write be judged against an
"objective" standard. If I had to talk into a
tape recorder, then so be it.

Of course we are dealing with not art and
aesthetics anymore, but political correctness.
There is truth in what Harold Bloom calls "the
literature of resentment". I prefer to think of
it as an utter lack of commonsense.

A poem may or may not be interesting in the
context in which it was written, but that should
not be the final criteria.

>>You said I said:


2. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR ALL POETRY REGARDLESS OF
AGE
OR DISABILITY (OR GENDER? OR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL?
OR
CLASS? ETC.?)

Coming from Millie, that gives me pause.  But,
again,
I have to re-translate it:

If the sick wish to advance the social
assimilation of
their fellow disabled, they should conform to
socially
accepted norms.

Am I misrepresenting the thought?

It's better for the disadvantaged or special
caste to
~impersonate~ the privileged majorities, in order
better to promote inclusion of their group?
-------

You didn't misstate what I said but you lost the
context, which was that
"sadly" this is true.  I also said that
logically, if we wanted to prove
that we aren't morons by writing poetry, we
should only have to write the
poetry average people who are not morons write,
which generally isn't very
good (to use a loaded term, of course).

I think it is silly to make poetry-writing the
center of a claim that
disabled people are as worthy of respect or love
or care as other people.
All people are worthy of respect, etc., by virtue
of being human, and there
are certainly som ediability groups whoo can
never write as good poetry as
non-disabled folks (say people who are multiply
handicapped and can neither
move nor speak and are mentally retarded (one
hopes these people have
extremely sever mental deficiencies because if
they are even conscious of
existing it must be hellish)).

A lot of times minority groups claim to have a
culture of their own and want
not to be judged by the standards of the
majority.  Perhaps a group very
invested in this idea wouldn'ty want to compete
in the field of poetry
because it isn't their domain.  Or they would
have a poetry so different
from ouirs that we couldn't understand it.
Recently, disability groups have
made use of the "we're different, not better or
worse" idea.  The Deaf (who
demand the right to be capitalized) have done
this the most, presumably
because they share a language that non-Deaf
people rarely  if ever achieve
fluency in.  Deaf poetry does exist and it is
incomprehensibe to non-Deaf
people, although there are also productions which
try to mix Deaf and
hearing words, music, and dance.

Gardener of Stars
by Carla Harryman

        Atelos (www.atelos.org) is pleased to announce the publication on December
31, 2001 of Garderner of Stars by Carla Harryman.


About the book:
        Carla Harryman describes Garderner of Stars as “an experimental novel that
explores the paradise and wastelands of utopian desire.” The book offers a
mythic  history of a post-historical city situated in a garden landscape
whose inhabitants are engaged in perpetual tending, limitless generation.
Their generatings and tendings take place in speculation and dream,
practical and impractical invention, desire and copious sex — all facets of
a politicized eros and an erotic politics.
        The utopia in question (“the unruly utopia of the senses that is not in
conflict with the world’s current”) must be understood first not in terms of
place but in terms of personage. M, Serena, Gardener (the eponymous heroine
of the novel) are themselves utopias (as distinct from utopians) surviving
in a painfully fraught (though sometimes beautiful) milieu. Negotiating this
milieu, the various characters come into contact (or, more precisely, throw
themselves into contact) with events that are in a ceaseless process of
coming into being and falling into ruin.
        But this utopia must be understood too as the very language, the prose,
that invents it. No contemporary writer has done more than Carla Harryman to
tend and generate the possibilities of prose writing in English. Haunted by
the future, Gardener of Stars is an extraordinarily moving, brilliantly
visionary work.


About the author:
        Carla Harryman was born in California and lived there until 1996. She now
lives in Detroit, where she teaches Women’s Studies, Literature, and
Creative Writing at Wayne State University. She was one of the founders and
the principal playwright of the Bay Area’s Poets Theater, and a number of
her theater works have been produced for the stage, with performances
throughout the U.S. as well as in England.
        In addition to Gardener of Stars, other books by Harryman include two
volumes of selected writings, There Never Was a Rose Without a Thorn (City
Lights 1995) and Animal Instincts: poetry, prose, and plays (This, 1989); a
hybrid novel, The Words after Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories and Jean
Paul Sartre (O Books, 1999); and a book-length dramatic work, Memory Play (O
Books, 1994).



About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip’s Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes; Gardener
of Stars is volume 10. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian
and Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Travis Ortiz;
cover production and design is by Ree Katrak.

we go day after day now. the rest of the world is terror. this is no
terror, not even the culling, the shattering of the thin shells of the
crust. this is a moment to think about intelligence, the intelligence of
the world, breaking out of the loop. this is the breaking out.  .  :this
is the way the aging brain works. neurons skein, tangle, interlace, inter-
weave. some die off. there are submerged strata absorbed by the other. the
other is transformed into others. wisdom is the networks among the others.
wisdom is the limestone, the submergence. wisdom is the marl gathered
beneath the peat. there are large saw palmettos at chikeka. the brain is
gathered among the confluence of life. the brain is self-reflecting,
resonant, subsumption architecture. wisdom is the making-manifest of the
network. wisdom is the culling of extraneity.:at chikeka, two men were
fishing. we went through the hardwood hammock. a little girl took some
mosquito-fish for her aquarium. watched the sawgrass. watched several
killdeer. a turkey vulture landed in front of the car, flew around to the
back. strangler figs everywhere. before that, oasis, back to the ibis
rookery. there were heron mixed in. walked through the mudflats to the
left of the runway. before that, back at shark valley. there were too many
cars. back at chikeka a possum eating alligator eggs. on the way out the
limestone showed. there were snake and crabholes everywhere. a huge flock

I agree in general with this analysis or actually I think Ashbery is very
highly intelligent, creative and extremely well read and a llateral thinker.
I think he just sits down, brain on fire, and writes: that's it! He's simply
a genius like Mozart: he just writes it down. Cheers, Richard.

Per his definition, Emily Dickinson was one of Damien's amateur poets.

Liking the idea of revolution is the romantic comfort of an armchair
revolutionary.  Bush et al will not, cannot, outlaw Islam.  But, what if
the Bill of Rights becomes, at least in part, a subversive document?  Do
the armchair folks act?  By then, it will be too late to act.

I don't know if this review, itself, is a fiction.  As I understand it, the

-------------------------------------------------------

K-Mart opened a Manhattan outlet at St. Mark's Place,
the main drag of the ever-punk, black leather,
green-haired/skinhead East Village, within blocks of
the St. Mark's Poetry Project.  The neighborhood was,
legendarily, terminally cool.  Soho was fed by East
Village painters.

I don't recall if they ever actually held poetry
readings there, but in trying to befriend the "Take A
Walk On The Wild Side" neighborhood, that K-Mart did
open an in-house art gallery.

There was an article on it in the New York Times. (I'm
sorry I can't locate it through Lexis-Nexis, well over
ten years ago.  I think I cut out the photo and used
to keep it over my desk.)

The premier artist's work looked highly believable.
The photo of him slumped at a K-Mart Cafeteria table,
young like tungsten over a paper coffee cup, a
second-hand suit with sleeves too short, cuffs rolled
up, vertical hair, was classic St. Mark's.

The "how," Geoffrey, to get an open reading in the
market place, or in Wal-Mart, is:

           to go in and propose it.

Walk in the door.  Ask for the manager.

You could write in advance, if you felt you needed
more influence, gumption or time.  Phone
1-800-Wal-Mart-Central-HQ (not a real phone number).

The store branch may not realize that Buffalo is such
a poetry mecca.  If you pitched it right, it's highly
feasible.  He'd surely see dollar signs and a way of
"reaching out" to the University population.  Of
uniting town and gown.

Wal-Mart has a Community Involvement Wal-Mart
Foundation:

http://www.walmartfoundation.org/wmstore/goodworks/scripts/index.jsp
,

Environment, Community, Children, Education.  There
are certain off-beat holidays they associate
themselves with, too.

* Community:

They've given matching grants to the Ballet Folklorico
Infantil in Los Banos, CA.  (If ballet, how not
poetry?)  They supported Grandparents' Day with
$750,000 in grants last year.

* Children:

Missing children and Code Adam.  Project Insight
provides eyeglasses to children at no cost.

* Education:

Ground Job Shadow Day.


(And there's no easier way to "make a name for
yourself" in the East Coast poetry world than to run a
reading series!)


=======================================================

"We live here, too. So we strongly  believe in our
responsibility to  contribute to the well-being of our
community. Together with our customers, we know where
Wal-Mart can help the most, and we can take great
pride in getting involved and seeing the results of
our efforts in  person."  --- Wal-Mart

"Art should not console," said Iris Murdoch austerely. But sometimes it's th=
e=20
only thing that can. One thing 11 September broke was a pattern in the ways=20
we see ourselves in the world. And when such perceptions are challenged is=20
when we most need pattern-making in the form of art. We need existing great=20
art, and to urgently find new meaning in structures already familiar to us;=20
we also need the structure of art made after the trauma to confront it, to=20
explain it for us.

Some arts can confront it directly. "We are not healers or protectors, merel=
y=20
artists," said Tom Hanks at the "Tribute to Heroes" telethon concert. But=20
Bruce Springsteen sang a new song, "My City of Ruins", for "our fallen=20
brothers and sisters", ending it with "Rise up, rise up". It sounds corny,=20
but it worked. "I wanted to hug the guy," says Rick de Yampert, a journalist=
.=20
For art does heal. The art of presenting audiences with knowledge that is=20
terrible to accept, of making us able to survive horror by structuring it in=
=20
a particular way, is the art of tragedy. And Aristotle's metaphor for=20
tragedy's method was catharsis.

Patsy Rodenburg, voice trainer at the National Theatre, has just taught a=20
Shakespeare-speaking course in New York. "There's a yearning there now for=20
profound work. You can go to the great plays and not feel so lonely. I did=20
Richard III and Julius Caesar; plays full of envy, grief, murder on an=20
unbelievable scale, about what they were facing themselves. They got the=20
power of it: Richard the murderer, 'hell's black intelligencer'. It's=20
comforting that it's happened before, that Shakespeare structured the words=20
for us."

After 11 September, the United States also embraced WH Auden's poem on the=20
declaration of war, "September 1, 1939". It was read on national radio.=20
"Auden muses on Manhattan skyscrapers as symbols of modern power, and the=20
isolation of America's consumer culture," says poet Dana Gioia, who recited=20
it at a reading on 12 September. "'The unmentionable odour of death/ Offends=
=20
the September night...' =E2=80=93 they gasped as I read."

"There's a profound thirst for poetry now," says Alice Quinn, The New Yorker
's poetry editor. "Anthologies of poems that speak to the time are coming=20
out; the Poetry Society of America organised a reading at Cooper Union, wher=
e=20
Lincoln gave his most stirring speeches; 1,200 people came."

Chip McGrath, the books editor of The New York Times, sees a different=20
cultural shift. "Books on warfare, Islam, Afghanistan, are jumping off the=20
shelves. Otherwise, it's cookery. Hardly any fiction, to my surprise." In=20
Britain, the bestseller lists have been reconquered by Harry Potter and the=20
celebrity chefs. In the US, however, another kind of book has recently been=20

vice-president of Magnum in New York. "People want to have something they ca=
n=20
keep. TV images are powerful, but fleeting."

"Mmm," said a friend of mine. "Isn't there a thin line between consoling and=
=20
cashing in?" Obviously, there will be some cashing in. No doubt the books an=
d=20
films have already started =E2=80=93 Woody Allen said the events would be "f=
air game"=20
for directors. Some will be exploitative; others will be necessary art =E2=
=80=93 in=20
the sense that Gerard Manley Hopkins found it necessary in 1875 to write a=20
poem on the death of five nuns in a blazing ship. "The Wreck of the=20
Deutschland" became his masterpiece, but that's not the point: he had to=20
write it. The Art Museum in Yad Vashem, Jerusalem's memorial-museum for the=20
Holocaust, contains sketches of gas chimneys, barbed wire and scalped hair,=20
made in death camps by people for whom art was a necessity: "driven to it by=
=20
what they saw," say the museum's curators.

Bruno Bettelheim, a death-camp survivor, said you shouldn't try to understan=
d=20
horror, just stop it happening again. The critic Theodor Adorno said there=20
could be no poetry after Auschwitz. But there had to be. To go on, we have t=
o=20
find a pattern in our responses to trauma. Audiences need the questioning=20
clarity of art; artists need to create new structures from pain. "Cashing in=
"=20
will depend on the artist's integrity. On 11 September, 11 members of the=20
photographic agency Magnum were in Manhattan: all took photographs. What=20
would 11 top photographers have done in New York but take photos? And now th=
e=20
book has come out. "If something upsets me," the photographer Helmut Newton=20
told me once, "I get my camera out. I believe that if a photographer has a=20
camera between him and horror, he can face anything."

"In a peculiar way, for artists, this is the best as well as the worst of=20
times," the theatre director Deborah Warner said recently. "We have a=20
terrible thing to draw on. There'll be new energy. My feeling after 11=20
September was to return to the theatre. It's a very safe place." That's the=20
response to Tom Hanks. Art does protect and heal. Sometimes it's the only=20
place where you feel safe.

On 11 September, however, art was made unsafe, too. Art, under attack along=20
with everything else, was abused; even stolen. When video-artist John Maybur=
y=20
saw the second tower hit, he recognised an aspect of his art: "What I was=20
seeing was artfully done. The first plane got our attention, so we'd look at=
=20
the second." The planes were a video-installation, with the world as audienc=
e.

The music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, the 73-year-old experimental composer,=20
has long incorporated elements of theatre and spectacle. He has followed=20
Duchampian aesthetics, searching for metaphorically violent ways of thrustin=
g=20
image and sound together. His 1994 "Helicopter Quartet", based on a dream he=
=20
had of "towers of television screens", thousands of outdoor spectators and=20
musicians in flying helicopters, was creepily prescient of 11 September as a=
=20
live spectacle. Inevitably, he responded to the attack in those terms, as=20
"the greatest work of art there's ever been. That people rehearse like crazy=
=20
for 10 years, totally fanatically for one concert, and then die! Compared to=
=20
this, we are nothing as composers."
Faced with fury and outrage, Stockhausen later said he was referring to the=20
"Luciferian aspect of art", but his comments also show that late Modernist=20
ideas of art, privileging spectacle and "happening", are stale; that they=20
must change.

Different arts will change differently as they move beyond 11 September. The=
y=20
will change because that day was destruction, the antithesis of creativity.=20
And making something new, good, bearable out of destruction is what=20
creativity is for.

The fall of Troy, of the "towers of Ilium", is tragedy's first metaphor of=20
human fragility =E2=80=93 and changes in design are obvious. "More emphasis=20=
on=20
safety," says Frank Gehry, architect of Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum. "More=20
technical discussion of how to get people out of tall buildings fast," says=20
Cecil Balmond, the designer-engineer of iconic buildings throughout the worl=
d.

Others may take longer. Art offers safety because it takes risks. Nicola=20
Lane, a London artist whose work is currently touring in the Arts Council=20
exhibition Adorn, Equip, says she felt guilty about taking a magnifying glas=
s=20
to photos of people jumping from the towers, "but I had to know the shape of=
=20
their bodies in the air". That's her job. Art has to risk knowing appalling=20
things, to draw constructive conclusions from them.

But risks can backfire. The earliest Greek tragedy we know of was written=20
when Persia was the global super-power. In 499BC, Athens helped the Eastern=20
Greeks rebel against Persia: in revenge, Persia burnt the Eastern Greek city=
=20
of Miletus, massacring men and enslaving women. In 493 BC, the Athenian=20
dramatist Phrynichus wrote a play, The Sack of Miletus, and was fined 1,000=20
drachmas for "reminding the Athenians of their own misfortunes".
After 11 September, the riskiest art may be fiction. Novelists can't ignore=20
11 September. If they describe it poorly, they kill their novel; do it well,=
=20
and they unbalance it and risk accusations of cashing in on the tragedy.=20
"Such a huge thing bulldozes through any narrative," says Deborah Moggach,=20
author of Tulip Fever. "You'd have to acknowledge it. Awareness of it affect=
s=20
everything, but if you mention it explicitly readers may feel it's dragged i=
n=20
for effect." Many novelists have been unable to work recently. "Shock, grief=
,=20
aftershock: one's reactions were extreme and changed every day," says=20
Moggach. "It was difficult to concentrate."

"Novelists respond in oblique ways, mediated by imagination," says Michele=20
Roberts, author of The Looking Glass. "That takes time." She was in the=20
middle of a city novel about suffering, death, and compassion, set in August=
=20
2001. "Now there'll be more death, and more compassion, " she says.

"September 11 is affecting novelists who draw inspiration from the world=20
outside, rather than the world within," says Amanda Craig, author of In a=20
Dark Wood. "It brought home to us how our cultures are bound up with each=20
other, and made the American psyche more permeable by the rest of the world.=
=20
My American characters have become more complex, anguished, conscious of=20
being hostages of fortune."

The novel is the art of the story, and stories outlast everything. What are=20
Troy and Persia now? A handful of ruins =E2=80=93 and stories. The story of=20=
11=20
September will be told when photographs are dust, as long as there are peopl=
e=20
to tell it. But though we live in a story-shaped world, we don't know what=20
shape it will take next. Osama bin Laden knew America's story =E2=80=93 our=20=
modern=20
Athens, our talismanic culture =E2=80=93 inside-out. It's in that narrative=20=
of=20
invincibility that the biggest break has been made. No one knows how=20
permanent this deliberate break will be.

For Americans to take control of their story again, they have to understand=20
it from other people's point of view. There are always two sides to the stor=
y=20
in a divorce, just as there was in the Crusades =E2=80=93 that episode of=20
international piracy remembered in the West in Turkish operetta characters,=20
in pubs called The Saracen's Head and in Bush's unfortunate rhetoric. Bin=20
Laden must have smiled when he heard Bush utter that word which, for million=
s=20
of people living in conditions other than ours, is so capable of arousing=20
memories of outrage. With 19 plastic Stanley knives( box cutters), bin Laden=
=20
became Saladin, energising the story of the Crusades as seen through=20
non-Western eyes.

Looking at one's own story from a different side is a prime characteristic o=
f=20
Western art, distinguishing Homer from, say, contemporary Assyria. Homer=20
shows the pity of war from both the Greek and Trojan points of view. The=20
earliest surviving tragedy, by Aeschylus, showed Athens's final victory over=
=20
Persia as a tragedy for Persia.

John Buchan, a master of narrative, knew the stories in other nations' heads=
.=20
"We have laughed at the jihad," says Walter Bullivant in Greenmantle,=20
published in 1916. "But there is a jihad preparing. The question is, how?"=20=
=E2=80=93=20
words the CIA might have attended to in 1996.
The day after the bombing of Hiroshima, a New York Times editorial declared,=
=20
"Civilization and humanity can now survive only if there is a revolution in=20
mankind's political thinking."=20

What happened to that revolution? Is technology the only way we've advanced=20
since 499BC? What about culture? Different ethnic groups live all over US=20
cities, but no one programmes sympathetic knowledge of other peoples' storie=
s=20
into our education. In Yad Vashem, Jewish schoolchildren are shown the=20
Holocaust story: why aren't Palestinian children, too? And where's the museu=
m=20
of Palestinian suffering, where Jewish kids can be taken to learn the storie=
s=20
of people they'll grow up beside? Why is the history of Islam =E2=80=93 and=20=
the=20
treasures it gave the West when we were still medieval thugs and warlords=20=
=E2=80=93=20
not on the national curriculum for all children in countries with Muslim=20
populations?

The art that helps us understand our own tragedies has to be big enough, lik=
e=20
that of Homer, to sympathise with the suffering of people who cause them. We=
=20
won't get rid of terrorism =E2=80=93 or the support for it now preparing in=20=

hearts and memories of thousands of mutilated, bereaved, dispossessed people=

=E2=80=93 without understanding our story and theirs, from their point of vi=

For =E2=80=93 as Gandalf says in The Lord of the Rings =E2=80=93 "Stories do=

Geoffrey,

I wish I had the answers. Most corporations have corporate giving offices
that fund programs and use their contributions as tax write-offs. It's a
nice thought (more a dream) that if  government funds poets in the schools
corporations could fund "poets in the stores." Finding someone who combines
a substantial literary background with corporate clout would prove a real
challenge, I suspect.

When Borders first started, it stocked works of local authors, and let them
hold readings and book parties. As its profit margin dropped (some of its
staff told me), its support of local writers dropped as well. It also
stopped carrying the work of many writers and musicians I like.

I believe many members of the "masses" could appreciate more interesting
literature and music than the media currently feeds them. Whether a
corporation would take the risk of supporting poets is one of the unanswered
questions. Whether the audiences themselves would take the risk is another.
Ginsberg did open the poem to many people. Poetry slams opened the door a
little further, before becoming its own genre. When I give readings I try to
educate the audience a little. (At St. Mark's Poetry Project, this isn't an
issue, but it would be at Walmart or Target.) By telling the audience what
I'm trying to do, I try to reorient their expectations. In some cases it's
helped, in other cases it hasn't.
Some people who didn't now a thing about langpo found they enjoyed it,
others found it made them "uncomfortable."

Nevertheless, the contingent that wants 19th century rhyming verse will
remain. I don't condemn them; after a day of writing what I write and
reading anything from Bruce Andrews to Marjorie Perloff and many stops in
between, I like to close out the night with a mindless TV show. My hope is
that some of the masses will take the time to challenge their current
tastes, and possibly expand them. But I've been hoping that hope for
decades.

Best,

Vernon

In a message dated 12/28/01 7:02:34 AM, immerito@HOTMAIL.COM writes:

<< As you say, his poetry resists the "find-the-major-symbols" school of
analysis by refusing to supply coherent narratives, points of view, thematic
focus, etc.  But it does so in part by seeming to _invite_ that kind of
analysis: because syntax, grammar, and that kind of thing is so often
"normal," even "eloquent," in non-_Tennis Court Oath_ Ashbery, the
uninitiated reader will at first invariably _attempt_ to read the poems for
a conventional referential meaning.  I know I did, anyway.  For example,
many of his poems have lots of water imagery, or sky imagery, or
writing-poems imagery, etc.  And in fact Ashbery continues to supply these
kinds of temptations in ever-more complex forms to those determinedly
traditional readers who have already learned his basic tricks but still want
to lobby for his status as a "real" poet.

Just look at at least half the Ashbery criticism out there, and you will see
attempts at exactly what you were saying can't be done: readings that try to
connect symbols, find cloaked narratives, establish a unified speaking
subject, and so on.  The first objection that springs to mind is that such
readings are perverse, but they're really not--the poems are _asking_ to be
treated that way.  You could accuse the poems themselves for being
critically perverse in setting up so many ingenious, perceptive critics.
The most obvious example would be Harold Bloom, with his Romantic
subjective-poet Ashbery, but you could say the same about John Shoptaw,
Leslie Wolf, Fred Moramarco, Charles Altieri, even at times a devout
avant-gardener like Marjorie Perloff.  All these very intelligent critics in
their various ways have set about to demonstrate Ashbery's suitability for
inclusion within a system of canonization and commentary that uses very
old-fashioned New-Critical modes of inquiry.

Furthermore, as I've been suggesting, they frequently meet with a great deal
of success, at least as far as they take their approaches, which is usually
just far enough to stop before they have to take account of Ashbery's
"trick": i.e., that the poems are only pretending to be those kinds of
poems.  (Actually, some of those critics probably acknowledge this, now that
I think of it, so please nobody call me on the carpet.)

But the paradox is that in order to pretend convincingly to be that kind of
poem, it must ... well, _be_ that kind of poem.  So for example, "Self
Portrait in a Convex Mirror" is on one level a poem of meditation about art,
identity, etc., and as such is capable of sending the Harold Blooms and
Helen Vendlers out there into paroxysms of ecstasy.  On another level,
however, it's a pastiche, a blank parody that short-circuits its stabs at
profundity as soon as it makes them, in the _act_ of making them.  This is
even more the case in poems like "Daffy Duck in Hollywood" or just about
anything he's written since 1990: these poems are like little facades set up
in a ghost town, with little signs on them saying "(close-) read me."  And
when you try, you end up realizing that you've only been close-reading the
sign saying to close-read, not the structure behind the sign.

In this respect, Ashbery's poems are different from the other contemporary
poetry you mention.  You're right about those poems: regular close reading
doesn't work with them.  They're made with that futility in mind.  Their
little hanging signs say something like "Don't even bother trying, pal."
Ashbery's, however, are like reversible jackets you can wear to either Iowa
City or Buffalo.

Kasey
 >>

If I may be forgiven for jumping in, Kasey's finger is on the pulse.  Ashbery
is, in all of his productions, a "language" poet, a manipulator of rhetorical
forms.  What he foregrounds (if I may use that well worn term) is not meaning
per se, but its structural interpinnings,   its source material so to speak.
Meaning is always a formal product, and Ashbery's poems are loaded with it.
What is deliberately lacking, typically, is a sense of unity (a "trick" of
relationality), the stratagem of the parts concealing their seams.  Best,
Bill

-------------------------------------------------------

That's how I read post-Ashbery/Language poetry: from
the entire ~oeuvre~ downward to the individual word.

When somebody's worth it, I read and re-read their
books, back to back, in succession.  And I'm a
marginalia FIEND.  I have a good memory for what words
I've heard --- I can usually remember, with uncommon
words, the last time a person spoke them in a
conversation or where I'd heard it --- so there's a
sort of reflex or ding! that goes off for me when a
word reappears a second time in a book or across a
series of book.  And a total Jacob's Ladder when it
appears three or more times!

I mark those words off in the margin, often with
symbols: my Howe books use the Greek ~theta~ for the
theme of thinking or thought; Greek ~mu~ (not my
sainted cat's name, which was Chinese) for memory,
remember, forgetting, etc.  (For a long time, I've
used Gk. ~pi~ for "poetry.")  Then, by a sort of
concordance method, I can re-examine the meaning of
any cell by how it's transacted over the full scale.
Meaning can also be re-diagrammed into a sort of
symbolic equation, semio-algebraically.


David Buuck at ~Tripwire~ has the MS of the
presentation I gave at the Barnard College Lyric
Tradition vs. Language Poetry Women's Innovative
Poetry conference, on Howe and this reading method,
which I called "vertical reading."  (I'm pretty sure
~Tripwire~ will thumbs down on it.)  Theoretically,
it's very sensible: with "asyntactical" poetry, the
~de're`glement~ (Rimbaud) has only been traced along
the syntax, the horizontal level; the paradigmatic
axis, or the chain of substitutions and iterations for
any word/synonyms, remains untouched.  Any poet's
unconscious idiolectical drives to re-use the same
words is quite personal and revealing.  (There's a
book on Wallace Stevens called ~Obsessive Images,~ I
believe.)  The associations are extremely subjective
or private, and usually hermetic to anyone who doesn't
intimately know the person: mere letters can become
hieroglyphs for people or associations (the letters in
the author's name, obviously), the way that Schumann
tucked away his mistress' and Clara's names in the
ASCH motifs.

The only catch is that, by vertical reading, words and
word clusters do wind up meaning something,
definitely, from macrocosm to microcosm, but it's
often something ~completely different~ from the
dictionary or standard meaning of the word.  ...so
that in contemporary poetry recurrent words are often
place-holders or "wild cards" that stand in for
private meanings.


An interesting exception, in John Ashbery, is his use
of hapax legumenon (words that turn up only once),
such as "jacaranda," e.g.


> Furthermore, as I've been suggesting, they
> frequently meet with a great deal
> of success


A critic's job is to impose a coherent template over
any poetry, or object of study.  (The opposite of that
was Deconstruction, which took apparently cohesive
texts and exposed their inconsistencies and
contradictions, ... but ultimately Deconstruction
received a great deal of negative backlash in
America.)

I once went in during her office hours, with the art
critic (diva!) Rosalind Kraus.  (That I merely dared
to go into her office left Ph.D. candidates pale.)  I
had found (David Hockney may have pointed it out,
actually) a visit that Picasso made to the Gaudi
cathedral in Barcelona, and I wanted to say (or
Hockney had said) there was a link between Gaudi's
broken crockery facade surfaces and Picasso's cubism;
I wanted to say that the elongated figures in
Picasso's Blue Period was El Greco (I am an ectomorph)
. . . And Kraus became famously impatient with me, and
said:

"It doesn't matter if it's true or not!  It's about
which *INTERPRETIVE GRID* you superimpose over
anything."


The "trick", as you say, isn't John Ashbery's.  It's
the critic's.  One is taught to "write through" a
secondary critical work: I took classes where some
post-structuralist was assigned almost randomly, and
you had to find a way of writing about the artist via
those ("unrelated") texts.

Sorry for the autobiographical reductivism,--- but he
had also just lost his job (or was on the brink of
losing it) as art critic for ~Art in America,~ whose
ownership had changed hands.

(...what irritates me is what people ~won't~ say about
"Self-Portrait", which should be so obvious: that it's
about ~narcissism.~)

That's absolutely brilliant.  He'd love it!  I hope
some List reader who's in contact with him mentions that.

I like the idea of "we're different, not better or worse."

Sometimes reading a writer from a "different" group teaches me a technique I
find useful in my own writing. Ishmael Reed is a good example.

As a person with a "disability" (Tourette Syndrome), I work hard enough at
writing to expect my work to be judged on its merits, not my neurological
condition. Nevertheless, I find that my condition influences my use of the
page as much as my reading of Olson, to cite one example. I've also found
that my condition gave me certain abilities that offset its disadvantages.
 My surplus dopamine enabled me to complete my work ahead of my co-workers
and sneak in some writing time at the office.)

People need to express themselves, whether they're disabled or not. Some of
them will become full-time writers, others will write simply to purge their
feelings. I make a distinction between a person who writes one crude draft
and feels good afterward, and a person who polishes the draft to a
professional piece of work. For some people writing is art, for others it's
therapy. As long as the person knows the difference, I don't have a problem.

I don't begrudge people with disabilities their publication in the
newsletters of organizations that serve them. Much of the writing I read in
this vein is badly-rhymed "poor me" poetry that readers find heart-warming.
I just wish the same organizations would give more support to the people who
can articulate their condition better. But then, we (or I) might not be
saying what the organizations want to hear.

laden, it seems to me, is neither the fierce warrior he is made out to be,
nor, as richard here thinks, a prophet...rather a capitalist renegade
bankrolling an organization whose activities he can't really participate in
other than in the position of cfo...i'm reminded of that oft played footage
clip of him firing the rifle & thought how awkward he looks both holding the
gun, & how fragile he seems when the gun is fired...not much chance of that
man on the front lines i'm afraid...i guess jihad is a wonderful idea when

        Richard,

        I can see why you see him as a Jesus figure, but to me he is more of a
James Bond foe. Larger than life while Martin Luther king is a JC figure if
any there was this century. It's the movie industry that shapes our need for
a man to turn into myth. From the days of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to Die
Hard, we need to have someone with vast amounts of wealth to stand up to the
word they want to dominate these days. There are no more bad nations to go
after with a global economy, one needs to be independent once the globe has
been ought over and won. So with bigger bombs and spy networks developing
one would figure would arise to form a Dr. No, or a Goldfinger. But we don't
have a James Bond, nor does Tony Blair, who I love - he's like a Thatcher in
drag - but that's not my point.


                            Best, Geoffrey

Via the EP discussion-list, this message:


Dear H.D. Society members,

    I am a grandson of H.D. and have been reading your postings with
interest over the past couple of years.  I'm afraid that now I have some bad
news to share with you.  My mother Perdita, H.D.'s daughter, died on
Wednesday at her home in East
Hampton.  I know that many of you were her friends and correspondents.
    What follows is the text of an obituary I wrote that will appear next
Thursday in the East Hampton Star.

                            Val Schaffner



PERDITA M. SCHAFFNER

     Perdita Macpherson Schaffner died on Dec. 26 at her home in Springs.
She was 82.
     Mrs. Schaffner was the author of many published essays as well as a
number of unpublished stories and novels.  She was an active philanthropist
and served on the boards of cultural institutions such as the Bay Street
Theater in Sag Harbor,
Poets and Writers Inc., and Yale University's Beinecke Library.  She
cultivated a wide range of friends here, in New York City, and in Europe.
In academic circles she was known as the daughter of the Imagist poet Hilda
Doolittle, who wrote under
the pen name H.D.
     She was born in London on March 31, 1919, and was raised in a highly
unusual household there and in Burier, Switzerland, near the town of
Montreux.  The identity of her father was a subject she long refused to
discuss, although she was amused
when biographers and dissertation-writers deduced that he must have been the
poet Ezra Pound, who at one time was H.D.'s fiance, or the novelist D.H.
Lawrence, who was a close friend.
     Although Mrs. Schaffner was originally named Frances Perdita Aldington,
H.D. being married at the time to the British novelist Richard Aldington, he
was not her father either.  It was not until 1983, in an essay included with
a reissue of her
mother's novel Bid Me to Live, that she publicly identified him as the
character who in that roman a clef is called Vane, and who in real life was
Cecil Gray, a Scottish music critic and minor composer.  Like Vane and the
novel's protagonist, the
musician and poet carried on an affair in the final months of World War One,
and he quickly disappeared from her life and that of his daughter, who would
meet him on only one occasion, in 1947, by chance, in the entourage of the
writer Norman
Douglas on Capri.
     At the height of the flu epidemic that followed the war, H.D. was alone
and ill in an unheated room in a seedy London rooming house, on the verge of
labor, when she was rescued by her young friend Winifred Ellerman, who wrote
novels under the
name Bryher and was heiress to a shipping fortune.  In what became a
lifelong relationship, Bryher took mother and daughter under her wing.
Perdita (the name comes from Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale) grew up in a
menage that included H.D, Bryher,
and the latter's husbands, starting with Robert McAlmon, a novelist who
later chronicled those somewhat manic years in a memoir titled Being
Geniuses Together.
     Bryher's second husband was yet another novelist, a debonair Scotsman
named Kenneth Macpherson who, like her, was in love with H.D.  The couple
formally adopted her child, who took the name Perdita Macpherson, and all
four set up house in a
towering Bauhaus structure overlooking Lake Geneva that doubled as a studio
for avant-garde films and was also home to an assortment of dogs, cats, and
monkeys.  They divided their time between Switzerland, London, and Paris,
where they were at the
center of a group of literary and artistic figures, some of whom, including
Gertrude Stein and Edith Sitwell, Mrs. Schaffner would later recall in a
series of vivid, witty essays.
     Surrounded by writers, the girl seldom had a chance to meet other
children, for she was educated at home according to Bryher's eccentric
educational theories.  She did, however, become fluent in French, German,
and Italian, skills that served
in good stead when, as a young woman at the onset of World War Two, she took
a job in with the Office of Strategic Services, which was the precursor of
the Central Intelligence Agency.
     She worked at a country manor called Bletchley Park where teams of
translators pored over scraps of intercepted Nazi messages decoded by the
top-secret "Enigma Machine"  Later she was assigned to OSS headquarters in
London.  She lived through
the Blitz and served as an air-raid warden with the novelist Graham Greene.
At the OSS she became friends with many American officers, among them James
Angleton, the poetry-loving spy who later earned notoriety as the CIA's
chief mole-hunter.  They
encouraged her to visit the US, her mother's native country, and after the
war she came and stayed.
     In New York she took a job as secretary for John Valentine Schaffner, a
literary agent who was starting out in business and could not afford to pay
her.  They fell in love and were married in 1950, setting up both home and
office in a
century-old house on East 53rd Street that is one of Manhattan's few wooden
structures.  They had four children, Valentine, Nicholas, Elizabeth Bryher,
and Timothy, all of whom grew up to be writers.  Summers and weekends were
spent at a rented
house in Southampton, on land that is now part of the Conscience Point
National Wildlife Refuge, and later at property the family bought in 1967,
an 18th-century farmhouse near the end of Fireplace Road, Springs, that was
originally the Parsons
homestead.
     Following Mr. Schaffner's death in 1983 she moved to Springs full-time
and developed a wide range of friends and activities here.  She began
publishing essays in The Star, in literary magazines such as Grand Street
and American Scholar, and in
editions of her mother's books, for which they served as prefaces or
afterwords.  One of them is included in the recently-published Best of the
Pushcart Essays.  She was a regular at meetings of a fiction-writing
workshop and a Shakespeare study
group.  She became active on behalf of the Bay Street Theater and other
local causes.
     She was a keen devotee of the theater--here, in New York, and in London
on annual trips there--as well as of travel.  Although Europe and the
Caribbean were her most frequent destinations, she also visited Kenya, the
Falkland Islands, Alaska,
Turkey, and Korea.  In Springs she built up a substantial library,
particularly of contemporary novels, literary biographies, and histories of
World War Two espionage.
     In 1996 she suffered a massive heart failure and spent two weeks in a
coma at Southampton Hospital, where the doctors, having almost unanimously
pronounced her case hopeless, dubbed her "our miracle girl" when she proved
them wrong.  Back home
she gave up smoking, substituted red wine for Scotch whiskey, and cut down
on travel but otherwise kept up her schedule of activities.
     Her heart remained frail, however, and following a seizure last month
her condition began gradually to decline.  She died at home, as was her
wish, among her family and her six cats.  She is survived by three of her
children: Val, an author and
former editor and columnist for The Star, who lives in Bridgehampton and
Manhattan; Elizabeth, also a former Star columnist, who has a home and horse
farm in the Northwest area of East Hampton; and Timothy, a poet and
publisher who lives in Tucson,
Arizona.  Nicholas Schaffner, a composer and biographer of rock groups, died
in 1991--a victim, as was his father, of AIDS.  Also surviving are four
grandchildren: Timothy's sons Wyatt and John and Val's daughters Kaya and
Lia.  A fifth grandchild,
a boy who will be named Pada Macpherson Schaffner, is expected to be born
within the next few days to Val and his wife Min-Myn.
     A memorial service will be held on Mrs. Schaffner's birthday, March 31,
at a place to be announced.  In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Bay
Street Theater are suggested.

I'm with you mostly on this: I dont think that ALL political correctness is
a bad thing. It becomes bad when it becomes formulaic, or denies expression
even of "wrong" opinions.... I took the point eg about cripples and how some
poeple would be sensitive to that term for example but feel that my right to
be eg acidentally insensitive, or to be strongly 'prejudiced'or whatever
must be considered..hence my rather tongue in cheek "diatribe" [Cripples
cripples cripples etc...] of course I wouldnt go around using rascist or
insenstive terms for the hell of it for I feel that that is wrong: but it
has to be acknowledged that they are used and sometimes we use them under
stress or because we need to or we were stupid or it was right to or we wer
angry or whatever.... some things are good that are PC but it can lead and
often does lead to straight-jacketting: however in regard to the young boy
we should yes be sensitive but he WILL get criticism: the next question is
one of personal philosophy and development etc when is it or is it ever good
to criticise (if it is obviously everyone is "criticisable") ..... I think
that in general directing or urging people, or at least helping them to
develop self development, confidence, esteem, is essential: but later we
have the question of (given a "mature" populace who have developed a good
inner strength so to speak) the desirability or otherwise of criticism at
all: the best kind is that which unaggressively assesses as far as the
critic is able, but also uncovers and inspires potential readers of a work.
Better overall to talk about a writer one is very inspired by...
  Obviously if we think someone is "hopeless" or "very poor" as a writer we
cant lie: but the answer there might be to avoid commenting on that writer
... actually a better way of critiquing might be to suggest ways a writer
might alter his/her writing..... its problematic...
  In general we should be positive, but obviously ther are times when a
discerning knife has to be used: but let the scalpel attempt to heal if
possible!
 Possibly this is more problematic with "new" writers than those
established.
 But overall I am in agreement. regards, Richard.

Title: Nine Points of the Phenomenology of Painting


"Title: "the canvas is an indeterminate size, sufficiently large to occupy
a fair proportion of the viewer's angle of vision. color and textual
attributes are also indeterminate, irrelevant, peripheral" Oil on white
canvas, black text in imitation of courier." this title affixed to white
label, traditionally placed to the left of the painting at an indetermin-
ate distance. beneath: "THESE ARE THE FIRST ERRORS."  description of
painting:  "Oil on white canvas, black text in imitation of courier." Text
rescued from the painting:

Upper left: "i reside here, huddled in flight within the corner. it's
comfortable but requires energy, continuous maintenance. one false slip
and i crash. this is half-wrecking zone, half-home. no one imagines i'm
here; it's safe. someone or something else ... requires the same amount of
energy ... has no place to huddle ... out in the open ... who knows "

Upper middle: "this is impossible, all this energy; i'm sliding back and
forth; you can't get to me; you can't find me; you know i'm not cornered;
i can never be cornered; this is the sky, the heavens, the empyrean; this
isn't the corner; the corner's always artifice; the corner takes a
different kind of energy, a push; here it's towards the vertical; i'm
always heading up, against the edge; the edge is a horizontal line"

Upper right: "The edge is a point. The edge is one-dimensional. I gather
towards the point. The point is natural; it's origin. It takes energy to
remain in the vicinity of the point. The point marks the edge of the roof.
This is a roof, neither sky nor heaven. You can always find me by my
coordinates. This is the Cartesian fetishization of the real. This is the
last of the systems of defense."

Middle left: "I'm against the margin, the margin is a line, a vector, the
margin points to the roof, the sky, the pole at pagoda center, I'm there,
rubbed raw against the Thing, vertical and human, walking, not fucking, at
attention, not supine, nothing's beyond the left; nothing's left of it."

Center: "there's nowhere, there are names and no names, there are things
and no things, there's nothing to grasp, i'm naked, vulnerable, you can
see all of me, you can see through me, i'm the punctum of representation,
this is the vanishing-point of the phenomenology of the real, arms and
legs, mountains and valleys, waters and locomotives, herons and pagodas in
all directions, frameworks and annihilations, states and processes, trans-
formations, the name leaks, suppurations, double dimensions, i'm sliding
in every direction, i can't see the lines or points, a spread or stain,
splayed or residue, abject, the stigmata of effacement of the other, the
strategic game, i.e. the location of the game, played out"

Middle right: "This is it - the vertical body - compressed against the bar
of the real - there's a bit of support for it - the vertical dimension,
hierarchy - the frame's holding - always aware of the frame - this could
be an infinite plane extending from here - imagine the possibilities -
lungs and breathing - in the distance - nothing at all - I remember the
center - I couldn't work there - couldn't begin or end there - all that
blanked space - nothing - but here - there's a moment of parallel - every
point has that - moment of perpendicular - the same - whole pencils of
lines - filling in the interstices - cubisms of all sorts - spectacles of
abstraction - styles - genres - I'm safe here - I could go on and on - "

Lower left: "she's down in the corner... she's there with him... they're
so safe... they're sleeping... look at them sleep... they can do anything
here... this holds the rest of the image... this is the source of all rep-
resentation... this doesn't have to do anything... this can't do anything
... another of the zero-dimensionals... they're fucking now... now they're
drinking... they're whispering... i can almost hear them... they don't
have to maintain anything... they're not sliding anywhere... they're
cuddling... they're quiet and serene... they're at rest... they're holding
their own... garnering sweetness and light... "

Lower middle: "What are you thinking of? We're sliding back and forth?
We're the base of all things! We're the foundation! What are we going to
do? Is this the horizon at your foot? This is the foreground of every
world! This is the earth against the ungraspable mysteries reaching
upwards beyond the possibility of body, organism, original face! Are you
claiming essentialism? Wouldn't this be essentialism, if such, if any,
were the case? Of course, still it takes energy to hold on! It takes a bit
of energy to avoid sliding to the point! Isn't the point zero? Isn't the
point nothing at all? Look, an animal! Look, names and contours! Look, all
sorts of things?"

Lower right: "outlaw grasps of forms and substances, crashed caches of
brushstrokes and inscriptions, compression algorithms of conversations and
languages: LOOK WE'RE SAFE HERE TOO: the wall of the work where the
signature sits: HERE: anywhere but there are expectations: IT'S CROWDING
US OUT: what is: the names: all the names: but they're safe, the store-
house: store-house of the real: something else, something else: I'LL LOOK
IT UP; demarcation one again of origins: IT SAYS HERE AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT:
one moment, one moment: "

lit from an indeterminate distance, THIS IS AN ERROR, in consideration of
the canvas - nevertheless, it's there _to be read_ as if there were an
adjudicated syntax, acceptable, beyond which the world is differend.

Agha Shahid Ali, 52, a Poet Who Had Roots in Kashmir
By ERIC PACE
Agha Shahid Ali, a Kashmiri- American poet who was a finalist for the 2001
National Book Award in Poetry, died on Dec. 8 at his brother's home in
Amherst, Mass., where he was staying. He was 52 and had lived in Brooklyn.

The cause was brain cancer, the publishing house W. W. Norton announced.

Mr. Ali was named a finalist for his book of poems "Rooms Are Never
Finished," which Norton published in November. Almost 30 of its pages
involve his elegy to his mother, who also died of brain cancer.

Grief and violence were among his themes.

In the poem "Of Light," published in the journal Poetry this year, he wrote:
"From History tears learn a slanted understanding/of the human face torn by
blood's bulletin."

When Mr. Ali became a finalist for the National Book Award, the poet
laureate of Maryland, Michael Collier, wrote: "As a Kashmiri, Ali is aware
of the historical vicissitudes that breed violence and hatred in people who
once lived together peacefully. His poems speak to the enduring qualities of
love and friendship. With elegance and wit, they also speak to the
difficulty of maintaining such relationships."

Another American poet, Michael Palmer, cited Mr. Ali's links to poets
ranging from the Urdu-language Faiz Ahmed Faiz to the Spaniard Federico
García Lorca. Mr. Ali helped introduce American poets to a venerable Persian
poetic form, the ghazal.

Cultural ties and divisions were also themes of his.

In his poem "Farewell" he wrote: "In the lake the arms of temples and
mosques are locked/in each other's reflections."

But another says: "A language must measure up to one's native dust./Divided
between two cultures, I spoke a language foreign even to my ears."

He spoke a combination of Urdu and English as a child, but he wrote all his
poetry in English.

Eight books of his poems have been published, and Norton plans to bring out
another in 2003.

Mr. Ali was born in New Delhi and grew up in Kashmir and in Indiana, where
his parents were studying. He moved to the United States permanently in
1975.

He held degrees from two universities in India and three in the United
States and taught at several American universities and colleges.

In addition to his brother, Agha Iqbal Ali, he is survived by his father,
Ashraf, of Srinagar, India, the historic capital of Kashmir; two sisters,
Hena Ahmad of Kirksville, Mo., and Sameetah Agha Murphy of Brooklyn; two
nephews; and a niece.
