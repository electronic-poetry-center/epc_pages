Regarding Richard Wright and "Melanctha"---

I believe I read somewhere about 30 years ago that during the Depression
Wright had some job with one of those public works projects (back when his
country seemed to be developing into a democracy), in which he was a
teacher trying to raise reading skills with poor Blacks. And he used
"Melanctha" as a kind of textbook.

Why can't reflection (in Adorno's sense) be socially urgent? Isn't one idea
in Adornos' Aesthetic Theory that art's reflection is the best (& only)
agent of social critique?

But aren't the forms otherwise available for expressing 'humanist'
alienation often alienated/ alienating in themselves? You seem to forget
that they're also cultural (not natural) forms. & What wd. it mean for the
writer to regard (rather than disregard) the reader? Aren't such regards

Why does 'voice' always have to serve as a model for explaining what
Language po doesn't do? What I enjoy in much disjunctive poetry is the
distraction of not becoming absobed and engaged by a persona (emotional or
otherwise)/ several personas/ voices but finding out about language as a
medium, when and why and how language controls, lets go of control & etc.

Sometimes humans need distance from the human/ humanist world. & sometimes
we need a more distanced control (or non-control) than what 'a leg to stand
on' implies.

What's the point of addressing if it only hightens sympathy and recognition?

I'm not just asking to provoke, I'm interested in the relation between
Adorno & the language poets & why you (/others) think that they're so
incongruent.

You raise some good points here - I guess my problem with this approach to
writing is I have trouble imagining "language" doing ANYTHING by itself.
There's always a human agent, selecting, distorting the feedback.  It's
always a voice, even behind the mask of "pure language". But I see your
point about distancing the poem from simply recording the self or selves.
It gets boring without the off-beat. Where would I be, in fact, a simplified
boring digital-talk-self, without Jack Spandrift there to raise the ante?
- Henry Gould

Henry, you "talk" too much.  Did you hear Gene Autry died?
- Jack Spandrift

Why don't you ever talk about women cowboys, Henry?
- Elliza McGrand

OK, I will.  I met one in Wyoming once, when I worked on the
Barlow Ranch for a few weeks before hitching west.  She was named June,
I think, was blonde, always dressed in spangles & such, but could shoe a horse
lay fence wire & rodeo with the rest of the crew.  I think she was the
top rodeo rider in Wyoming for a while.  That was about 25 yrs ago.
My brother could tell you more about her.  He was a regular there for
years.  - Henry Gould

Don't believe a word of it, Elliza.

Re. the current debate about Spivak and over-complicated writing, the
following may be of interest (if not strictly topical):

Two scientists, American Alan Sokal and Belgian Jean Bricmont, are
causing a stir in Paris with their book "Impostures Intellectuelles",
published next week. They attack the writings of, amongst others,
Jaques Lacan, Julia Kristeva and Regis Debray. They write: "We want to
'deconstruct' the reputation that these texts have of being difficult
because they are deep. We show that if they seem incomprehensible, it
is for the very good reason that they have nothing to say." And about
the above-mentioned thinkers they say: "They talk abundantly of
scientific theories of which they have, at best, a very vague
understanding. They display a superficial erudition by throwing words
at the reader in a context where they have no relevance. They
demonstrate a veritable intoxication with words, combined with a
superb indifference to their meaning." Jacques Lacan (a well known
psychoanalyst) is criticised for "arbitrarily mixing key words of
mathematical theory, without in the least caring about their meaning."
The authors take particular exception to one of Mr Lacan's lesser
known theories, in which he argues that "the erect male organ, not as
itself, not even as image, but as the missing piece of the desired
image, is thus equal to the square root of -1 of the highest produced
meaning."

According to the Guardian newspaper here in the UK, the book is
"already a topic of furious - and unfathomable - debate in the cafes
of the Latin Quarter".

There is also a fairly short (French) article about it on the Web, at
http://www.yahoo.fr/actualite/970925/culture/875179380-yaho87518288603
6.html

At the very least, I suppose it shows that this issue is certainly not
limited to Indian writers.

David -- the link your cited article gives  is defunct. But for anybody interested
in the French reaction to theSokal/Bricmont book just out in France, check the
following web page of the French daily "Libération":

http://www.liberation.fr/sokal/index.html

It's in French, sorry about that, but it also has a link to Sokal's own homepage in
NY where he has carefully archived all the "sokal affair" data.

Ma, A Novel



Clara and Travis meet in a foreign city. She returns to Fukuoka-Yr. They
correspond by email halfway across the earth. He travels to Fukuoka-Yr
to meet her at the airport. As the plane approaches, he's surprised to see
herds of animals near the edge of the city. He'd have to ask her later.


-----------


Ma, A Novel


Which I do work on: "Her nights, his days. Her days, his nights."

And that he comes to a foreign city and does not understand the language.
And that the airport is brown. He's got a sheet of paper, he can't de-
cipher. What is it, where is she. He shows it, there's a taxi, a sheroot,
he gets in, it's already old, nervous. He goes somewhere, recognizes
nothing. Characters in other scripts, cuneiforms for all he knows. Llamas
cross his path.

But the city's vacant, her place is vacant. Locked or unlocked - in this
novel, it won't make a difference. He goes in, the door opens. There's
nothing, no clues. It's clean, no dust, breakins. He doesn't know. This is
a man, Travis maybe, who doesn't know a thing.

He can't find her friends because everyone shrugs. He meets people who
speak his language, easy now. They know her. They haven't 'seen her
around.' She's the kind of person one sees around. She's private. But
there are no rumors, nothing. She works in medicine.

Well, she hasn't been at the clinic. Nothing is missing. You can see where
this is going, of course. Doors close behind him, before he reaches the
knob. The keys are like Berlin keys, they go through the hole, out the
other side. That's important, there are windows through rooms and no one
is ever looking.

Now something has to happen for the novel to be a novel, what then? Per-
haps a clue, but there are always clues, even clues in the beginning of
things, the glance of a dark-haired woman at the airport, a slip of cel-
lophane on the floor of her flat. Clues are things that gather meaning,
reverse time, reconstitute events. But things are cluttered here; the
sook is filled with blood where the animals are slaughtered, nomads come
in from the countryside, shrines are staffed by garage gong bands. The
Genkai Park inexplicably closes down; there are guards, something's hap-
pened.

No clues then, but this happening. What could be on the run. Later, two
people are captured, he doesn't understand. There's a celebration in the
city involving a wheeled boat which capsizes against chains of humans
carrying placards of waves. People are really injured and the clinic's on
hand.

He finds food, stays in her place. He's ill-at-ease, a woman comes wear-
ing a veil and he pays the rent, holding up the currency of his country.
He's surprised how little everything costs. He should feel as if he were
now a part of her life, the woman who was going to meet him, but he does-
n't. He might wear a bracelet or necklace one day. He wears her jumpers,
goes out aimlessly. He thinks, it's all come to a halt here.

He finds himself listening to himself finding himself, but he's not lost.
Just that there is this constant wonder at the world. He's more in love
with her than ever before. One day, he goes to a screening of silent
films, Melies. Women are disappearing all over the place. He'll make a
film about a magician, a woman who brings men back to life. The woman
trance-trains, has visions. Then she sets up mechanisms, everyone knows
all of this and she's quite successful. She dies. Her extras are out of
work, lifeless. They form a secret circle. They keep her corpse, have
visions, try to raise the dead. They have visions, but they don't trance-
train, in fact they do nothing at all. She comes back to life.

There's a knock at the door of the flat. He's been there for months, un-
recognizable. His nights, her days. His days, her nights. Whammo-kazowie,
she's at the door. It would be presumption to ask. She talks about vis-
ions, what she knows. Beneath the flat, there are missile silos. Next
door, enigma code writers are hard at work. Across the way, the buildings
are part of the largest ship ever constructed, you can see the alley-
gangway down to the sea. The ship begins to move, everything shakes for a
minute. The ship stops again, earthquake he says, no she replies.

She's learned everything, signs and symbols. She can't read the cuneiform
either, but insists it isn't important. What comes between the letters,
she confides, that's it more or less. What comes between the letters, he
realizes, is his own alphabet. Everything shudders, they take the Shin-
kansen back to the sheroot stand near the roman ruins. The drivers are
different and perhaps she departs.

But the novel won't go this way. It will be populated with expatriates,
colorful characters named Abdul, Charisma, and Jennifer. They'll drink
a lot and expostulate. There will be all sorts of other horizons strat-
egically across going-native. Sarongs and turbans, veils for the women,
who would and wouldn't. There are fires on the other side of the city -
they never come nearer. Guerillas, one opines. They listen to the short-
wave, marry local, leave one by one. They fan out across the city.

No, they don't, nothing like that happens. There are clues to the woman's
disappearance. The airport appears to be a mechanism of some sort, the
runways laid out in shamanic configuration, easy hiragana squared off for
the takeoff and approach. The stewards knew he was arriving. The pilots
watch him, uneasily, warily, he can't help noticing. Whatever is afoot
takes him by surprise. Nausea, fear.

And then, the rest of the novel. Things happen.

Fragmeant


Travis wrote to her. The time and return was .465 seconds on average, not
bad when Fukuoka had been considered the center of the world in the four-
teenth century, his own hometown unknown, fallow, untended. He was aware
of the gaping maw of the sun, violent lunacy of the swinging moon which
rarely showed its face - from its night, the radiance of her day showed
forth. Mesmeric, he adapted himself to her schedule, his sun-up suppers
with his friends were the occasion of back-channel conversations about
sanity and the diameter of the earth. He joked he was the only one aware
of circumference, of what a sphere was and meant - that he was the only
one earth-bound, everyone else walking with stitched eyes and habits
formed from childhood. He knew the sphere of stars and its awkwardness,
how it shuddered above and below the equator, the rings of luminescent
star-clouds and their satellites, give and take of unknown constellations.

But it was his doubling that fascinated him, breakfast as dusk rose, not
dawn, sleeping at odd hours reflecting gaps and silences, and his Monday
night class that began oddly enough on Tuesday morning at seven - he re-
mained surprised that the students were alert, keen on the speed of the
Net, which should have been accountably slow and clumsy.

His clocks gained a minute, lost a minute. He tried to meet himself half-
way, like a friend. His nights were bright with untoward clarity, unthun-
dered days, dark, uncanny, silent. Someone fixed the stars, he thought,
they were never when they were supposed to be.

She wrote him about the llamas.


______________


Llamas


The llama glistened, black carapace covered within insistent tortoise
plates gleaming in the brown air of noon. It didn't move. Sirens in the
distance constantly changing, warding off violent cars close to veering
out of control. The head turned. Smoke from the nostrils, soot-nose
beneath glowering eyes, body tensed with radiant energy. Shimmered waves
of heat rose from the back, the breath, the brow.

She noted this in her brown notebook, ruled with blue lines. She wrote him
about the llamas near the Shikuneem, vicinity of Kasuga-Shi. They were
llamas, Luria, she was a tracker with a blue felt hat, sorobon and note-
book, penning ebb and flow, turbulent streams of animals burrowing into
the world. They were moving in from the arroyos south-west of the city,
the burning-plains traveled only by the Shinkansen. It was said that bones
sparkled as the trains rushed by, straight unbuckled rails held up to the
sanded grounds too hot for human touch.

Travis remembered her uneasy witnessing, now the thing before him, as if
produced by the cuneiform inscriptions everywhere in his vicinity. It was
a one world, transitive, her llama text taking root, hair, and bone; she
was nowhere to be found. Had she left him these animals, created by pure
description? Was her disappearance contained in the eye of the beast, the
vestiges of retinal memory destroyed by the fire next time? For a second
he felt the creature recognized him, but that second passed, replaced by
the uncertain knowledge that he was losing her trail as the purely exotic
began its uneasy hold.

Did she watch from the grey-pink building tiled against the sky? Did she
lay harbor-dead, trolled by fish and crustacean, memory lost and tangled
in kelp, seed-pods of aquatic plants adapting to stratified pollutions
dragged from shore to sea-bottom and back again?

Travis found his language tangled as well, the product of uncertainty,
loneliness, and an ignorance so pure he had no name for it.

Parting the Thirty-Fourth


Clara reached over for her box of cigarettes; if Avi didn't leave soon,
all hell would break loose. He'd already fallen off the futon three times
in the night, what would you expect from a gaijin who faded in and out of
the desert weekly.

The Desert Weekly, lead story: Gaijin loses grip on wadi edge, plunges two
meters to gravel pitstop, slight remains of moisture lapped by desert
frogs. Pictures, page 2.

When he left, she turned on the radio, cd player, computer, called the
airport, Fukuoka International. The name for city was 'ir,' Fukuoka-Yr
carved in cuneiform on the corner lintels everywhere. They never let you
forget. Flight 75, San Francisco, Oregon, Nepal, Catalina Island, Oman,
Fukuoka-Yr in that order. It was on time and she imagined the plane poised
perfectly in a planetary ring, waiting for the moment to descend. She
dressed, left the bet-ie, headed down the street.

The llamas were waiting as she stepped into the troika. She headed out on
Number One Highway, south, left on Shogun. She hadn't worn her hat, see,
for quite some time now. They stopped by the marshes, approximately five
kilometers from the terminal. She watched the plane make perfect descent,
dialed Robert immediately, continued on her way.

When Robert answered the phone, Jane was in the other room. They spoke in
whispers, aha. She told him all about the recent demographics, head-
counts. Later he'd say she was nervous, preoccupied. He was a specialist
in cartoucherie, useful where the only secure mode of communication was
still clay-based. Lady Sarashina had written

 Were it not for river rock and pine
  This clay would not have impressed
   My name, my love, your _hon_

or book, mnemonics of his mind, to whom she had written, borrowing from
Chinese Ch'in-fu, the impress of the reed pen, striations of thought as
the seven strings, seventeen vibratos, sounded, then faded into ma. Clay
into thought, material into the silence of the word, all this heaven.

Clara was circumscribed by Robert's interest in her demographics, by the
movements of llamas across the burning plains, by the distance of the
troika (found by the side of the road) from the airport. Her disappearance
dissolved into the gaze of Travis, waiting for her, waiting and waiting -
a gaze transformed into a glance, then the look-see of astonishment as he
began to understand she might never meet him again. Would he remember her
voice, enumerating herds, packs, gaggles, schools, flocks, enervated
groupings of the awkward black mammals, their armor-plating clacking in
the heat of the day?

Every one of these people were breathing, in and out.

Clara turned over lazily, suddenly realizing what had happened. She woke
with a start in utter darkness. The worst had happened. "Travis," she
said, uncertainly, "Travis."

'Yes,' he replied, as a hand slid along her arm, her face, her hair. "I'm
here, darling, I'm here."


_______________


On or Off the Mark


He rose early, left her house. After the second week, he had installed a
tighter lock on the door, although the thin window-frames were easy enough
to puncture. Now he felt he was in her shell, the doubled times between
his home city and Fukuoka collapsed into the singularity of her absence.

As he rounded the corner, a young man on a blue bicycle passed, face in-
tent on negotiating past the yellow just-ahead-truck. They collided.

Travis felt for his glasses, notebook; young Sven apologized. Clockwork
could be heard in the midst of the spilled packages. A woman crossed the
street, umbrella in hand. "I'm quite sorry," he stammered. "No damage
done," he replied.

"Everything is time here," Sven said. "Their whole lives are planned out
for them, even the priesthood. Monotheisms take their toll." What wasn't
there to understand.

"Have you seen her, by the way," asked Travis, "the woman who used to live
here - I was supposed to meet her weeks ago. She's been missing as far as
I can tell."

"I've been missing her."

"You reported her to the police?" He had, with little luck, no results,
less comprehension. "Gaijin," they had said, "Avarim," it happens all the
time. They have their own customs, come and go, the trade-routes and the
like. Sven nodded. He had long blond hair, vacant gaze, thin leather
jacket.

"I've seen her," he said, deciding to tell. "She's the one I drove to the
airport, we had a spill on the way. She was gone when I came to. I didn't
say anything to the police - moonlighting. Mind if I smoke?"

Had a cigarette, continued. "I knew her for several years here, we're a
close community. She was aloof, prone to raging in the streets late at
night, we got along. Had something to do with the llamas, I couldn't see
the point in tracking imports you know. She thought they made patterns in
the city - the only patterns here are the runways at Fukuoka-Yr Interna-
tional. They're a glyph you might read from the air, a sign for love, odd
in this environment."

They looked around at the factories, smoke, grey-pink buildings, men and
women speaking incomprehensible tongues, Palawian, Sumerian, Hittite.
Everyone was bound by cuneiform, common among them. Everyone, even Travis,
could he but read the literal writing on the wall.

"She was involved with something," Sven said. "She talked about a new kind
of corporation, I didn't follow her. It didn't make sense, but this was,
she insisted, different, it drew a blank where an economy might be."

"Drew a blank?"

"It emptied finance, not engaged, didn't zero out, plus and minus, assets,
debits, that sort of thing. It had power in production. It had chains,
flows, automations. She was tracking it through the llamas, said they were
intelligent, agents of sorts, traffickers."

"I never saw llamas like these before," Travis said. "Carapaces are unus-
ual, pangolins or armadillos, yes, but not your typical ungulates. For all
I know, they might be wired, plasticine, something of that nature. All
those plates. Look there."

Travis loved explanation, it made sense of the world. As a child, he took
screws apart. He ordered the world and the world was filled with orders
filled and delivered. Now he thought, the city, the city. Now he thought,
I'm totally wrong here. He wanted to return to the house.

Suddenly Travis knew that Sven knew something, Sven knew Travis knew noth-
ing at all.


______________



What the World Did and Said


A fierce wind drove across the plains. Tumbleweed blew about, covering the
Shinkansen tracks and trains slowed down for the nowhere sight. The sun
gloomed red and sullen against the silhouettes of mountain torn from the
planet's paper scroll. Lizards scuttled across the pock-marked rocks and
earth; centipedes scurried under cover, their legs coated with tiny crys-
tals of embedded sand. Even the llamas moved slowly, their scales burn-
ished by gusts scouring the remnants of the natural world.

Still the stars turned in more-or-less constellations, in a frozen sky
above the doomed melee. Below, a lidded eye opened to nothing, closed
quickly;  above, vacuous light reflected only clouded surfaces for whole
races elsewhere intent on penetrating the secrets of the earth.

The moon and sun, tethered, trembled and yawed at the taut cords binding
them together in the fugue state of the world drawn down into heat and
exhaustion.

Clara woke again.


_____________


Letter


She sent him a letter in a dusty envelope of clay, impressed with reed
characters. It fell into her home through the mailslot, cracked open on
the floor.

He couldn't read a thing. Sven could:

darling, darling, darling, darling
darling, darling, darling, darling
darling, darling, darling, darling
darling, darling, darling, darling

"Is that all," Travis asked, is that all. Sven shrugged, look at the repe-
tition. Travis felt the current.

The envelope, Travis said, "the envelope." Sven picked up the pieces, the
Shearim-Ku address clearly visible. But there was more, long drawn-out
lines scrawled, reassembled, recuperated, the ascension of language in
Sven's nimble hands:


these may secrete glues fixatives across the spine of the wanderers o dar-
ling emptied coffers not even coffers not even wood-logs holding shekels o
darling not even monies of this world and the next o darling vertebrae of
the wanderers o darling in you in this stony you in you heptagon o darling
three beauty you unknowing-travis knowing me


Sven slowed toward the denouement of the powerful message, the twenty-one
darlings of the tripled heptagon, Sven noted mesmeric Travis in love,
Clara's presence filling her tiny home, welcoming him forever, ghost of
Clara, projection-Clara lost on walls and ceilings, Clara-wraithe tip-
toeing across tatami floors, whispers everywhere. Sven stopped writing,
turned towards door, left quietly, Travis to his own devices.


______________



Engagement Ring


Travis thought, it emptied the economy. What was precious, disappeared -
exchange value, all of it. Take the fetish out of Marx, the rare jewel
simply doesn't exist, everything is common, free software. Not communism
or socialism, simply nothing. Gold unstable, platinum non-existent al-
ready. This corporation was _disengaged,_ not there. No chairman of the
board, no stocks. No offices, products. Power in absence.

Travis thought, he couldn't conceive the future here, what then? Was it
hoarding, llama-plates carefully disguising sheaves of rare metals, dia-
dems, high coinages of nations on the way down? Silver was transparent
at the edges, diamonds lost their glint, cobalt its eerie luster. Art
copied itself, copies shuffled in the commodities market along with salt,
oil, corn.

Travis feverish.

Travis thinks Clara-knowledge. Thinks like Clara thinks, llama-gold-and-
silver. Thinks traces across the ruffled streets unfurled with absence
ignored; there would be no resurrection. Cuneiform strategies and wagers.
The political economy of preciousness.

Travis thinks, Clara is precious. Thinks the disappearance of Clara in
this incomprehensible land, cries Clara-comfort, calls Sven for help.
Travis is wise, the glimmer of idea.

Sven arrives, they're in the house. Sven smokes, Travis drinks. "What's
the possibilities here," Travis said, about absent-Clara. Humans don't
have exchange value, not since slavery, capitalism's roles, the military.
There's always someone else beneath the blue felt hat, always someone,
don't mistake the exchange for an individual's history.

"We're bound together," Sven says, but something escapes. Love magnifies
it, you were coming for that. "So the corporation takes action. Clara,
like uranium, radium, glows. She disappears, you're flattened out here.
Her work stops; you can't read the language, hiragana clay-marks. It's
over, you're in her house, wear her clothes, breathe her."

"You and the corporation know it's not enough," Sven smoked. "So they'll
think you're a danger to them. Don't take any troikas!" Because it may not
be me driving.

In an economy of zeros.

"It's not enough," Travis drank. "She's alive, the keikan are in on it."
The message had twenty-one. Travis thinks maybe the city is the corpora-
tion, Fukuoka-Yr. Or Robert, Sven, or none of them. Travis thinks of
llamas. All the Gaijin, Avarim. "Everyone's life is precious to someone."

"But not everyone arrives enhancing the value of the woman or man tethered
like sun or moon, crackling the earth's surface, burning plains, forlorn
cry of enameled llamas ..."

With one ring, Clara rings him up.


_____________


Kudasai


Travis loves Clara. Clara loves Travis. There's an absent corporation.
There is helpful Sven. There are questions about power. What a stock
response! Travis decides none of it is true.

Directly across the street, the house slides into the water, a nuclear
submarine almost ready for action.


___________


Corporate


It didn't know where it was or who it was. It didn't have a name and there
was no one around to name it. Like Sartre's anti-semitism, anti-llamaism,
if it didn't exist, it would have to be invented. Somewhere in the minds
of men and women.

It simply _vacated_ worth from scarcity, building up from economies of
plenitude and planetary grace at the end of the twentieth century. A uni-
versal drain, it would have been suspicious of life, of movement not its
own, of secret exchanges, mining for jewels and gold. It protected itself,
circumscription, proscription; it trundled into the real smarts of people
destined to see an hour into the future.

It was the enemy of lovers everywhere! Of all that was beautiful on the
face of the earth! If it feared, it would have feared love! It knew no
fear! It had the beauteous Clara, or did it! It was approaching Travis!
There was no end to it! It could afford to wait and wait, Fukuoka-style-
of-the-Golden-Seal! It had all the time in the world! Travis was in mor-
tal danger! Clara, where was Clara!

She rang him up, "Don't think for a moment, Travis, that anyone has con-
sciousness besides you and me." Knowledge is disseminated between the two
of us. We tremble in the jouissance of the selves! Everyone else is stu-
pid!

Travis, "Stupid?" blinked an eye. Well, not stupid, perhaps, you know me
and my language. Ah, but unthinking, with blinders on. We're too far gone
for that, you and me.

Travis, "Far gone?" We're at the limits, darling, looking out, looking in.
It's a thin line as it is; we're getting pretty good at tight-rope. There
is nothing else, do you understand? It's unthinking, though, in a differ-
ent way. Think of it as a value-thief. It's all that left when plenitude
and scarcity are overturned, why some of them are worth more than whole
countries!

"Where are you," asked Travis, nerves shot, arms stretched to the break-
ing point. Truth made him weak.


______________


Lucky Star


"these may secrete glues fixatives across the spine of the wanderers o
darling emptied coffers not even coffers not even wood-logs holding
shekels o darling not even monies of this world and the next o darling
vertebrae of the wanderers o darling in you in this stony you in you
heptagon o darling three beauty you unknowing-travis knowing me"

the letter had read, enclosing sixteen darlings. Sven set to work. The
wanderers were llamas surely. "Spine" comes from the back, perhaps a
reference to carapace? Rogue llamas fetched no prices, the coffers were
gone, rotted away - what next but world-wide currency?

Twenty-one was the voting-night-club age in Fukuoka. Everyone who was
anyone would be at the Plex that night. Why, it was a holiday. He rang up
Travis.

Travis thought, too many phonecalls, hello. Arrangements made, the troika
carried both of them down Ben Eliezer. Travis saw the building had a tur-
ret, watchtower, lookout for llamas and now submarines. I must be imagin-
ing things. A beacon revolved on high, spitting out sumptuous code, darl-
ing, darling, darling. Maybe a warning or just premonition.

Inside, the chaos witnessed from a thousand movie stills, bodies tuned to
220 heartbeats a second and the local voltage. Because of the mirrors, a
thousand people descended into punctuated gloom and infinity. They lost
each other almost immediately; Travis was never to see Sven, dead or a-
live, again.

He moved towards what he gathered was the source, equidistant from his
images bounced and shattered in the impossible space. He measured himself
thereby. Towards the star-chamber where everyone was twenty-one. Towards
the heptagon drawn on the floor, like a bad novel where everything fits
together, like my life, Travis said. One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven. As he rounded the corner, Clara.


______________



Ice


Ice storms whipped the plains into a second frenzy, needles feeding on the
rippled ground. In Fukuoka, everything was sheen, the dim sun reflected
in a million blunted images, like lost dancers of the heptagon writhing in
memories of ecstasy. Bamboo tubes, set among the cacti, howled the proper
notes of dead emperors, until they where shattered by blast and rind. The
temperature hovered near zero, breathed in and out of it; layer after
layer of ice turned streetlamps into hailstone mimicry. The moon shone
blue, sun white-green; the stars were pinpricks against the frozen black
backdrop of withered weather.

Howling, they danced! Fierce, they danced! Gripping each other, pulling
hair by the roots, arms clawed into one another, they danced! Screaming,
they danced! Fallen, scraped, bruised, they danced! Laser-blind, eyes for
each other, spear-tip eyes, they danced! Travis hungered, Clara hungered,
they danced, arms and legs, ripped cloth, fed, feeding, torn! Torn naked
against the marrow of the floor, bone-marrow, blood-marrow! Stumbling to
their feet, howling! Danced the darling dance! Danced the beauty dance!
Danced the dance of death and exile! Danced the Dance of Speech and All
Phenomena! Danced Being-Nothing-Time, danced the Scratch-and-Wounding-
Dance, faces, arms, legs, breasts marked black-blue, trembling, ecstatic!
Travis hungered, Clara hungered, danced the Proper Name! A great shout!
A great SHOUT!

A GREAT SHOUT!


_______________



THE GREAT SHOUT


They fell.

They fell exhausted to the floor, half-conscious, they fell soaked and
blooded from scrape and scratch and bruise, Plex went silent.

Naked in the rubbish of torn clothing. On the floor they did lay there
naked in their torn clothing.

Something had occurred in the empire of depletion, someone spread a thin
cloth, was it llama-skin, across them. Again, indecipherable writing on
the surface, above and below, shadow enumerations of cancelled transac-
tions, carrying over from vacancy.

Bodies stirred, threw off their wrappings; intense flesh greeted the
dancers who left silently. Lam and Pam approached, gathered Clara-Travis,
helped limbs and torsos from the centripuge, now down a corridor, tunnel,
backroom.

Elsewhere, Library of Bet Shearim, an unlidded eye continued to count,
reticular engravings on microscopic glass slide. Such pane shatters; what
was there, visioned, died on the rapidly-evaporating surface. Stentor,
rotifera, flattened in agonies of starvation, asphyxiation. Now Clara and
Travis are unencumbered in the lobby of a fine hotel on the other side of
the city, solitary, guarded by patient llamas.

Now they will begin to speak, tell their woeful tale beneath the watchful
eye. What has eye gained, what lost? Corporation trembled in first-time
fearful sloth, transfixed heptagon signaled rise in universal perception.
Clara said, "In order to see, one must be able to close one's eyes." Great
wonders appear in darkness, hypnagogic truths, eidetic imagery close to
imaginary sources. "Vision is the half of it."

"Vision is knowing how not to see."

"Vision is blind."

"Vision is knowing deference."

Corporate listening, writing scurried on piles of skins. Begins one where
other leave off. "Species aren't forever," thought Travis. It takes some
doing. I never knew Sven to thank him. Redolent Clara-Travis wrote and
rose from sumptuous couch. Marble disappeared above into the sound of
sirens, Plex on fire.


______________


Vision


"We danced," Clara said, slowly, around the couch. This was later, now it
was wisdom-dance or ordinary, an ordinary in which we become once more
acquainted after these many adventures. Then we knew the couch was for a
purpose, half-sleepy llamas in the peaceful kingdom. We returned and
slept.

"Our silver souls rose, until we exchanged them for a different color."
Dark blue bodies appeared, grown from bone-marrow spine fields on a world
marooned, unlike our own. The economy of need shuffled goods along field
furrows, bales of raw materials, llama carapaces, bills of lading. Bone-
field dark blue bureaucracies invaginated in maroon earth, black-brown
commodity trails lettering the landscape.

"What was most apparent was the blindness of it all, the inconsequenti-
ality." Nothing seemed to mean or matter; meaning was drained from this
uncanny planet of the senses.

"Meaning was drained," Travis added, because meaning comes only with ex-
change, only with value-added; rob value, and meaning disappears. Pure
survival requires only pipelines, jostling, inert strategy; meaning is an
investment of an entirely different kind, related to sentience. Here's
where the world starts and ends; if lettering is littering, there is,
literally, nothing to be said.

"Nothing but the bills of lading." In the vision, souls and trails swirled
and if there had been only a singular witness, an eye that closed, whole
realms would have shattered. As it was, there were cracks.

Clara continued, "There were cracks where the furrows were; we watched
them widen. It was our eyes that did this, our ability to close, turn
away, ignore." The more we watched, took our places among the dark blue
souls, the more things began, slowly, moving out of kilter, askew, awry,
ajar.

"The lid has an effect."

"It was the corporation," Travis said, "the corporation that was closing
down through its awakening by our lids retreating the image of the world
into occasional darkness." We became aware there were three of us, Clara-
Travis, and then, this, inertness stirring, breaking itself apart, per-
haps seeping into the real.

"It had to do with the llamas as well, for example, they too had eyes, the
necessity of sleep, the moments of turning-aside, leaving us unguarded for
a second, a minute, hour, or day. And so we awoke, the two of us leaving
the vision-world now splintering, cracking into rubble - we awoke knowing
corporation awoke as well, all of this, knowing only llamas."

Locked in infinite embrace, they left hotel for streets unnaturally lum-
inescent in the nighttime sky. Travis could just about see the familiar
words of his native language interspersed between the incomprehensible
symbols - just about, then everything would fade, once more, to a world
of unknown wonders.

They went back to their home in silence.



_____________




In Hebrew, lama means "why," said Travis.

Exactly, said Clara, a melamid.

Hi all,
I'm mostly a lurker on this list but the very interesting exchanges
on race/class of the past few days has provoked me out of my closet.

Two things happened in the past few months that concerned me
and made me wonder if it would be possible
here in san francisco to have some sort of public forum (perhaps at
new langton arts, where I am one of two literary curators) on class
and "innovative writing" that would not degenerate into name calling.

One was a discussion I fell into at a party with a "innovative" poet
who has been in the community here a long time. We were reflecting on
how things have changed over the last fifteen years with the decline
in arts funding. When I came to san francisco it was possible to have
a literary community that was very stimulating from the streets so to
speak. There were for example free workshops taught by Bob Gluck at
Small Press Traffic. Anyone could drop in. This provided me and others
with an invaluable opportunity to learn and read and talk etc etc.
You could find a really smart community. NOW, however, you've got to
pay for that, through poetics programs, creative writing programs etc.
One of the main reasons people go to those schools is to find a
stimulating literary community.

So now, even more than before, the people who are fluent in the terms
and theories of "innovative
poetics" are people who can afford to go into debt to the tune of
tens of thousands of dollars. This is weird, folks. I don't like it
at all.

The other thing that happened that concerned me was a performance poet
(spoken word stuff) who protested some curatorial decisions at NLA on
the basis that we were curating an in group, something she though NLA
had always done.

It's true and it's not true. We've perhaps been curating more queer,
minority, younger writers than in the past. That's something we're
interested in. But what is true is that we curate people who all have
sort of the art school type of literary education. It's like you
need that to get in the door, which means $$$. That slants and
distorts not only the resulting literary community but also
impoverishes the
relationship of the literary community to the wider community.


I'm wondering how others have dealt with these problems and tensions,
specifically with relation to "innovative poetics".

On a similar note, I'm still haunted by the image (imagined, alas--I never
got to see the real thing) of the Madison Wisconsin fire of a few years ago
that levelled the world's largest cheese warehouse. Apparently there was a
river of molten cheese several feet thick running down one of the streets
for days. The mayor told an interviewer that it wasn't funny.

Thank you for that Holly. I did - I think - actually know that but it was
in a remote
part of my head from which there are very few connections. Much
appreciated.

would have been in on this Stein conversation earlier, but I now have no
access to email from home (hope to change that in the coming months) -- so
only see my mail a few times per week --

yes, _Reading Race_ contains a now somewhat outdated discussion of
_Melanctha_ -- the publisher is U of Georgia Press,,,,, and I can make a
shady postal deal with anybody who can't find the volume nearby --

BUT

among the more recent relevant publications is the Fall 1996 issue of
Modern Fiction Studies devoted to Stein ,, which contains, along with much
else worthy of note, Lorna Smedman's article on Stein and racialized language

You can find it in Peter Baker's _Onward_ (I think that's the title), an

Mime-Version: 1.0

NEW from Avec Books:

The Grouper
Lissa McLaughlin
Poetry * Prose * Photographs



The unexplained coherences intrigue me, the every day exotic, how random
abrasive fragments operate as structure. Something succinct and deep is
expressed that cannot be said in words.
                                       --Mei-mei Berssenbrugge

In Lissa McLaughlin's drive-by America, there is more than just the view
passing frame by frame outside your window. Beneath a seemingly still
surface, sensory experience cuts deep. Danger lurks in many forms:
gun-wielding uncles, hurricanes, nascent sexuality. Here, the sticky stuff
of memory is equal parts experience and dreamscape-and what falls in
between. Lissa McLaughlin reaches through the boundaries of consciousness
to create a richly layered prose.
                                        -Kathy Lou Schultz

Lissa McLaughlin knows that narratives based around memories are truest to
experience exactly at that moment when they know what can't be said. The
pained, angry, yet often slyly humorous collection in The Grouper
illustrates that memory must never pretend to understand more than it can.
The starkly resonant, but finally resistant, photographs show how language
can only navigate edges of the irreducible instants of a life which words
cannot finally know. In so doing, The Grouper reminds us that trauma must
never be reduced to an excuse for story.
                                            -Mark Wallace


Reading The Grouper, we are "listening for the mess to speak, afraid it
will." Convincingly, disturbingly, Lissa McLaughlin has "opened her mouth
as far as it will go" and given us  pictures of language learning "to mark
physically the moment speech ruptures." What does writing become when it
"refuses to enter the novel memory writes"? Page after page, in brief prose
fragments and fragmented anecdotes, in photographs and jaggedly chiseled
poems, McLaughlin provides a turbulent sequence of answers to this
question, where "the meaning of nothing becomes more and more clear to us
[as] bits of the temporal world snag and accumulate." And if the language
is a "mess," it is nonetheless well made, offering not chaos but the form
chaos takes when we call it writing.
                                               -Stephen-Paul Martin

Lissa McLaughlin has written film reviews and a children's picture book.
Her fiction has appeared in _The Massachusetts Review_ , AVEC and _The Best
American Short Stories_. Her previous collections (_Troubled by his
Complexion_ and _Seeing the Multitudes Delayed_) were published by Burning
Deck.  She lives in San Francisco.

I wanted to come back to the list, after a long absence and a new e-mail

recommend Kali's fairly remarkable speculations about race, Judaism, and
identity yesterday -- I found them wondrous and provocative (in a good
way).

At my new school we had to undergo "diversity training" last week,
something akin to what Texaco executives must have had to undergo a few

(And now you have to imagine -- for lack of me being able to put them
there -- an "A" in the upper left quadrant, a "B" in the upper right, a
"C" in the lower right, and a "D" in the lower left, which letters
correspond to categories of people called "mainstream" "bi-cultural"
"traditionalist" and "counter culturist" (oh no, not that!). Anyway, the
idea is that some people have high capacities to "acculturate" -- can't
we all get along -- and low ethnic identities: they're mainstream.
(Other, less sanguine terms, could be substituted here). High ethnicity
and high acculturation would be bi-cultural, able to get along in
multiple worlds, or "style-flex"; high ethnics and low acculturates
would be those unable to compromise, hangers-on to their own traditions,
and the last category would be those "alienated from both the ethnic and
the majority culture communities." (I always thought those were the
poets, but many folks on the list would disagree).

I don't know why I did this -- I hate categories myself -- just wanted
to give a glimpse of what passes for official diversity these days. The

seemed kinda strange to me that, in the ongoing (imagined?) debate
between the "cold experimentalists with no leg to stand on" and the
champions of some sort of warm direct-address aesthitics of "humane
impulses,"  adorno was somehow recruited on the side of humanism and
purportedly non-ideological clarity.

could this be the same teddy i know and love?  a quick perusal of
_minima moralia_ reassured me somewhat and i reproduce the following
quote because 1) it made me chuckle and 2) it seems vaguely relevant to
any assertion of straight-no-chaser "aesthetic" practices based on
"obvious" principles or the idea that there is such an animal as clear
communication or direct expression of "emotion."

it's from section 53, entitled "Folly of the wise"

"In his limitless and and implacable demands the petty-bourgeois sticks
his chest out, identifying himself with a power he does not have,
outdoing it in his arrogance to the point of absolute spirit and
absolute horror.  Between the grandiose sublimity embracing the whole of
humanity--a sublimity ever ready to trample inhumanely on anything small
as mere existence--and the coarse ostentation of bourgeois men of
violence, there is an intimate collusion.  The dignity of spiritual
giants is prone to hollow booming laughter, exploding, smashing.  When
they say Creation, they mean the compulsive will-power with which they
puff themselves up and intimidate all questions: from the primacy of
practical reason it was always only a step to hatred of theory.  Such
a dynamic inheres in all idealistic movements of thought...

"The attempt to deduce the world in words from a principle is the
behaviour of someone who would like to usurp power instead of resisting
it...The rose-scents of Elysium, much too voluble to be credited with
the experience of a single rose, smell of the tobacco-smoke in a
magistrate's office, and the soulful moon on the backdrop was fashioned
after the miserable oil-lamp by whose meagre light the student swots for
his exam.  Weakness posing as strength betrayed the thought of the
allegedly rising bourgeoisie to ideology, even when the class was
thundering against tyranny.  In the innermost reaches of humanism, as
it's very soul, there rages a frantic prisoner who, as a Fascist, turns
the world into a prison."

oh that teddy: he'll make ya laugh till you cry.

wow, this argument is so old hat that it's hard to believe it's actually
causing a fuss somewhere.  esp. in reference to lacan, against whom the
argument is at least 30 yrs old, as a quick spin through michael clark's
garland press bibliography wd show....t.

---------------------------------
They [Sokal and Bircmont] write: "We want to
'deconstruct' the reputation that these texts have of being difficult
because they are deep. We show that if they seem incomprehensible, it
is for the very good reason that they have nothing to say." And about
the above-mentioned thinkers they say: "They talk abundantly of
scientific theories of which they have, at best, a very vague
understanding. They display a superficial erudition by throwing words
at the reader in a context where they have no relevance. They
demonstrate a veritable intoxication with words, combined with a
superb indifference to their meaning." Jacques Lacan (a well known
psychoanalyst) is criticised for "arbitrarily mixing key words of
mathematical theory, without in the least caring about their meaning."

I actually found some of Lacan's writings quite evocative in this regard
(in my extremely limited reading of Lacan). I liked the links between L's
use of the terms 'Real' and 'Imaginary', and their use in the mathematics
of complex numbers, as well as his formulation of desire as the excess of
want over need, and how this simple arithmetic led, through recursion, to
what sounded like almost fractal complexity (although I can't recall the
passage right now).

While L's use of the language of mathematics might be interesting
poetically, I can sympathise with Sokal and Bricmont's fear that L's
apparent "intoxication with words, combined with a superb indifference to
their meaning" (although that sounds like as good a definition of poetry as
I've heard recently) might not be all that helpful in understanding the
workings of the human mind. Do the Real and Imaginary axes meet at the
origin (zero) in? Does the Symbolic realm provide a third axis, and if so,
does this begin to introduce quaternions, and the need for another realm?
What do the various arithmetical operations represent within the mind (if i
(= square root of -1) is the phallus, what do -1 and 1 become in his
scheme? Is there a link between i and the "I", representing unity on the
imaginary axis?).

I even vaguely considered linking Mandelbrot and Lacan in a poem to be
entitled "The Fractal Geometry of Desire", but choked on the portentous
title. Is the boundary between the desired and the undesired a fractal,
becoming more complex (and even undecidable) the closer one inspects it?

I'm not sure what Lacan would have made of Mandelbrot. He (Lacan) seems to
have displayed an almost arrogant disregard for the possibility that
biology might have something to do with the mind, which is one of the
reasons why I never persevered in reading Lacan, whereas Mandelbrot seems
to have shown a healthy interest in a variety of arts and sciences. Was it
Mandelbrot who said "Erudition is good for the soul"?

For the Great Left Theorists, it's always somebody ELSE's ideas that are
"idealist illusions", "abstractions", "will to power", etc.  Materialism
and alienated labor provide the master key with which to lay out these
broad-brush cliches.  Doesn't seem to occur that perhaps the basic ability
to generalize, synthesize, empathize, and communicate might transcend
the various blinders of the various political positions - and that these
tools of thought might just as well be linked with humility as arrogance.
History can always be brought to bear to prove the opposite - but then what
is history but the tale of the Great and their Great Deeds? - Henry Gould

Camille,

In my experience it has never been that overwhelmingly true, that
innovative poetry people "can afford to go into debt to the tune of tens
of thousands of dollars."  But it sure isn't true right now of most of the
poetry folks I work with.  My own situation is very much working-class and
barely getting by; from what I've encountered and heard, not that
atypical.

Not questioning relevancy to _The Grouper_ in particular, but, Mark
Wallace (you're on this list, yes?) what do you mean by "language can
only navigate edges of the irreducible instans of a life which words
cannot finally know"? Or rather, "language can only navigate edges of
the irreducible" to take it both out of context and out of constituency.

You mean that? In general?

I may have confused everyone in my just sent post by giving the wrong

The List should know that there is no more Language-writing.
Language-writing has been disconnected from the List in the larger sense.
When Bob Dylan sang for the Pope, they agreed to excommunicate
Language-writing. Language-writing, a local disturbance in NYC, the Bay
Area, Vancouver, Seattle, Kent State, Cambridge, and Alabama,in the 1970s
and early 80s, is now a memory (and whose?) in history books, & meanwhile a
number of individuals who lived thru those times continue to write. But
Language-writing has left the planet, the way Imagism left the planet
(except for _Poetry (Chicago)_ & various "sunday-painting" clubs) by 1929.
That Language-writing parrot is a dead parrot. That parrot has been
transformed into its future molecules. And so it follows that, dead & gone,
Language-writing cannot exist as an object of bashery. They dont want to go
on about "the tensile strength of last winter's icicles". If a poem offend
thee in the present, pluck it out. But look to thine own eye, that its mote
not be bigger than a beam. In short, people will have to do something else
with their Oedipal longings. Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings. But
please address the fact not the messenger. Thanks, David

God, I love the sight of wagons being circled! I don't know what it is that
gets to me, the dance-like sensuality of the movement into place or the

I also love parades and brass bands.

It seems to me that what is "irreducible" is desire, to echo a phrase in
one of Mark Wallace’s recent postings; also that language poetry in its
explorations of the constructedness of our  (at least in the USA) all
too common sense of being used, of our language being used-up, detached
desire from it’s language forms—

Now no one can really live with that situation (to my view). I choose
the word "desire" not to get preachy about something spiritual,
transcendent, or other or "not" —simply in the hopes of addressing an
array of palpable emotional facts. Hopefully those new to the
excitements and difficulties of poetry, even graying poets and editors
like myself, know that desire is irreducible, that desire is not
satisfied by making of language itself some fetish object. I also
believe that most language writing was perfectly clear concerning this
felt dissonance (the difficulties, the limits of language). That agenda
for addressing reality and social fact may have in some ways outlived
its usefulness. Is language "irreducible"? Is desire "irreducible"? I am

Interesting post.  Some quick notes in response.  Two things here: class as
an issue underlying the practice of writing and how to address it, within
the context of "innovative writing."

As someone pointed out to me recently (as I'm struggling with how to address
class issues in a piece I'm at work on)--while there is a vocabulary for
working with gender/sexuality issues in innovative writing, there is no such
vocabulary for working with class issues, particularly in poetry.

Also the issue of having an intellectual life outside of the university.  I
don't have any answers but I'm very interested in the question!  I think
there is certainly difficulty there.  Though I must say personally (and I'm
outside of the University) I'm enjoying the intellectual stimulation of the
list, of participating in Bob Gluck's workshop (which is inexpensive
relative to Univ class), attending readings here at SPT and elsewhere in SF,
reading journals etc and talking to some extent with other writers. Of
course, this is in between working full time, being a mother, partner, etc.
Bits & pieces.

Seems to me over the years the language writers and their adherents
have given as good as they got--wheeling out their big guns to bring
down the walls of mainstream practice and stolid MFA program verse.
When the shelling stops, that's when you should worry. (Sorry about

I thought those interested in the Sokal opera might find this posting of
interest. This article (partially posted below)first appeared in on-line
mag, PostMortem. I also published a lengthy review of Gross' and
Levitt's Higher Superstition in British print mag, Science As Culture,
late last year. The latter is more pertinent to the current discussion
but I can't transmit it because I don't have a copy in any form.---Carlo
Parcelli. P.S. Don't count Adorno and the Frankfurt school out as
regards the above topic.e.g. Dialectic of Enlightenment.

"Science smiling into its beard, or first full-dress
          encounter with evil"
          by Carlo Parcelli

          "[H]ighmindedness is the mark of every professional ideology.
Hunters
          for instance would never dream of calling themselves butchers
of the
          woods; they prefer to call themselves the real friends of
animals and
          Nature, just as business men uphold the principle of fair
profit, and the
          god that thieves also take for their own is the business men's
god, that
          distinguished promoter of international concord, Mercury. So
not much
          importance need be attached to the way an activity is mirrored
in the
          consciousness of those who practice it."(from Robert Musil's
The Man
          Without Qualities, chapter 72)

          Robert Musil, in his monumental novel about pre-Anschluss
Vienna
          entitled The Man Without Qualities, addresses often and
profoundly
          social and epistemological questions arising from applications
of science
          and technology acceleratingly evident in pre-World War I
Europe.
          Chapter 72 contains some of the most succinct expressions of
Musil's
          concerns. The first paragraph of the chapter which is
sardonically entitled
          Science Smiling Into Its Beard, Or First Full-Dress Encounter
With Evil
          reads thus:

          A few words must now be said about a smile, a masculine smile
at that,
          with a beard attached to it, whereby the general activity of
smiling in
          one's sleeve was transposed into the masculine one of smiling
into one's
          beard. It was the smiling men of science and learning who had
accepted
          Diotoma's invitation and were listening to the celebrated men
of the arts.
          Although they smiled, it must on no account be believed that
they did so
          ironically. On the contrary, it was their way of expressing
homage and
          incompetence, a matter that has already been mentioned. But
one must
          not let oneself be deceived by that either. It was true enough
where their
          conscious mind was concerned; yet in their sub-conscious-to
make use
          of this customary word-or, to put it more exactly, in the sum
total of their
          being, they were people in whom a propensity to Evil crackled
like the
          fire under a cauldron.

          I was reminded of this passage in Musil's work when I
encountered
          Steven Weinberg's piece, Sokal's Hoax, in the August 8 New
York
          Review. In his first paragraph, Weinberg strikes the very
tone, smile
          included, that Musil alludes to:

          Like many other scientists, I was amused when I heard about
the prank
          played by NYU mathematical physicist Alan Sokal, who late in
1994
          submitted a sham article to the culture studies journal Social
Text.

          A couple of friends of mine brought me a copy of Weinberg's
article
          cautioning me that it would "get my hackles up." Actually, it
did nothing of
          the sort. Even though Weinberg points up the pitfalls of
applying
          interpretation to mathematically defined phenomena by
ridiculing aspects
          of the writings of culture theorists, his piece contained
eight caveats
          concerning the limits of science which dovetail quite nicely
with my own
          concerns. In fact, I was startled to find Weinberg making a
number of the
          same points which I made in a book review of Higher
Superstition by
          Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt published in a recent issue of
Science
          As Culture. It would be delusional of me to think that a
scientific
          eminence like Steven Weinberg would read anything I wrote much
less
          consider cautionary any insights that I might provide. I
therefore must
          conclude that Weinberg's caveats that strip the power from his
own piece
          and form the foundation of mine have a certain pan-cultural
quality that
          transcends educational, economic and doctrinal castes.
Following are the
          eight alarms that Weinberg and I would like to sound:

          1) Weinberg dissociates his argument from technological
applications. He
          states:

          Those who seek extrascientific messages in what they think
they
          understand about modern physics are digging dry wells, In my
view, with
          two large exceptions, the results of research into physics (as
opposed,
          say, to psychology) have no legitimate implications for
culture or politics
          or philosophy. (I am not talking here about the technological
          applications of physics, which of course do have a huge effect
on
          our culture,...) (my italics)

          I assume that one would exclude science's "extrascientific
messages" in
          which scientists, CEO's and journalists proselytize for the
inherently and
          ineluctably progressive nature of science or the justification
of "pure"
          scientific research on the grounds that often unpredictable
yet beneficial
          technologies accrue as 'spinoffs'. In short, how do "purely
scientific
          discoveries" achieve ahistorical status; in other words how do
          phenomena, universalized, quantified or otherwise shed their
historicity?

          2) The second part of Weinberg's quote above contains caveat
number
          two:

          ...or about [physic's] use as metaphor, but about the direct
logical
          implications of purely scientific discoveries themselves.)

          But science writing itself because of the mathematization and
          quantification of phenomena resorts to metaphor to communicate
only
          contingently the "purely scientific." This is not to fault all
science writing
          but when language as opposed to mathematical expression is
used to
          describe physical phenomena then the limited tools of language
including
          metaphor impose their conditions on expression and
communication.
          Weinberg's phrase, "logical implications", is an attempt to
fuse the
          ineluctable element perceived in science e.g. its discrete
logic with the
          historical and hermeneutical change that it is often required
to undergo
          leading to the pliable and breachable skin of "implications."

          Though I have no beard to smile through, I was amused (and not
          surprised) to read in Higher Superstition that the authors
held the
          philosophical movement, Logical Positivism, in high regard
specifically the
          work of A.J. Ayer. Although this form of positivism's
connection to
          physics is based primarily on personal temperament one
understands
          Gross' and Levitt's affection for it because it, like
mathematical equations
          in their ideal state, is simple and tidy---actually anal. In
this manner, the
          Vienna Circle even mistook Wittgenstein's anality for their
own. But more
          than that, Gross and Levitt are attracted to Logical
Positivism's
          comprehensibility. It is akin to poetasters who sing the
praises of A.E.
          Houseman, Robert Service, Edgar Lee Masters and Robert Frost
while
          finding Charles Olson, Ezra Pound, David Jones or even T.S.
Eliot
          gratuitously difficult. Often it is difficult for scientists
more than other
          people to see their personal limitations expressed in
seemingly objective
          choices and connections because as Musil puts it:

          ...[A]fter all [science] dominates us, not even an illiterate
being safe from
          it, because he learns to live together with countless things
that are born of
          science)

          The world more and more conforms to the conditions of science
so we
          tend to forget that the world itself is not scientific.

          3)Which leads to caveat three. Weinberg admits that science is
inherently
          hegemonic. If we are to accept "purely scientific discoveries"
as
          "objective" and "unbiased" then the implication is that they
are also benign
          in the sense that they are not "discovered" with any agenda in
mind. You
          can see how difficult it is to separate the notion of an
aparticular scientific
          moment from its intention. According to Weinberg and others in
the
          scientific community no generalization can be made about the
intention of
          science nor will members of the scientific community suffer
any criticism
          of sciences special relationship with 'reality.' There is
indeed a
          paternalistic if not a posture of false omniscience behind
such insistence
          upon immunity from criticism that is hard to reconcile with
the alleged
          compelling nature of the argument for "a one-to-one
correspondence"
          between scientific explanation and objective reality and its
continuing
          failure by force of argument to compel conformity rather than
contrary
          interpretation.

          4)Weinberg's fourth caveat is related to the first three. He
writes:

          The other, more important exception to my statement is the
profound
          cultural effect of the discovery, going back to Newton, that
nature is
          strictly governed by impersonal mathematical laws. Of course,
it still
          remains for us to get the laws right, and to understand their
range of
          validity; but as far as culture and philosophy are concerned
the difference
          between Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravitation or
between
          classical and quantum mechanics is immaterial.

          Then comes Weinberg's caveat:

          There is a good deal of confusion about this, because quantum
mechanics
          can seem eerie if described in ordinary language.

          First note, in the first part of the quoted material above
that physical
          theory is provided with ineluctable 'position' because it is
expressed
          through laws and yet outfitted with the 'momentum' of time by
the very
          mutability of these laws as scientists wiggle "to get the laws
right." It
          simply remains for scientists to declare that science is
cumulative and that
          in the "effort to get laws right" they will not broach any
fundamental
          change. In short, five hundred years is apparently enough time
to assert
          the immutability of scientific laws. Science has expanded our
conceptions
          of time to something approximating the Hindus or Mayans. But
our idea
          of the eternal does not rest with our actual experience of
time but in our
          ability to abstract it.

          When Weinberg says that "there is a good deal of confusion" as
regards
          quantum theory and western standards of perception and
expression, he
          is minimizing a problem that has engaged physicists,
historians of science
          and philosophers of science since the inception of quantum.
Weinberg
          himself is confined to ordinary language when he endeavors to
          communicate the tenets of quantum theory to people with a
limited or
          non-existent mathematical background. Weinberg's popular books
rely
          on standard methods of language expression including metaphor
to
          communicate their points. In the realm of language, where
quantum finds
          no adequate expression, the differences "between classical and
quantum
          mechanics "is" not "immaterial." If language is inherently
deceptive or
          insufficient for the task why does Weinberg write books or
articles for
          that matter. The paradox reminds me of a chapter in a book by
physicist
          Frijtof Capra called The Tao of Physics. The chapter is called
Beyond
          Language yet is comprised of several thousand words.

          Certainly given the success of his books which popularize
various
          physical phenomena, Weinberg is not recommending that we adopt
          Wittgenstein's famous tenet at the end of his Tractatus, "What
we cannot
          speak about we must pass over in silence[?]" If so we can
happily and
          gratefully look forward to no more popularizations of the
natural world
          from Weinberg or his colleagues.

          Here allow me to provide a counterpoint to Weinberg's
'pragmatic'
          position. Physicist and mathematician T. Bergstein in his book
Quantum
          Physics and Ordinary Language came to this conclusion about
the
          "eeriness" of the phenomena and its expression by expanding
the
          "implications" of the physical term 'complementarity':

          Through the selection of words and sentences it is possible
for the mind
          to accentuate or weaken the complementary elements of
communication
          in innumerable ways. The wide variety of different forms of
knowledge
          embedded in language cannot ever be comprised by scientific
description
          because the accentuation is necessarily fixed on the
subject-object
          partition. An adequate description of human existence must be
sought in
          the ordinary uses of language, in the humanistic sciences, and
in poetry -
          not in natural science.

          Poetry! We could start with Wallace Steven's poem The Pure
Good Of
          Theory which

          would go far in pointing out to Weinberg many of the
contradictions in his
          thought. Stevens writes:

          . . . If we propose

          a large-sculptured, platonic person, free from time,

          And imagine for him the speech he cannot speak,

          A form, then, protected from the battering, may

          Mature: A capable being may replace

          Dark horse and walker walking rapidly.

          Felicity, ah! Time is the hooded enemy,

          The inimical music, the enchantered space

          in which the enchanted preludes have their place.

          Unlike Weinberg (who could be that "large-sculptured, platonic
person"),
          Stevens honestly addresses epistemological conundrums as they
manifest
          themselves in the process of writing and possesses
considerable
          philosophical tools with which to do so.

          From the "humanistic sciences", I would propose Edmund
Husserl,
          specifically his book, The Crisis of the European Sciences and
          Transcendental Phenomenology: Husserl writes:

          Where is that huge piece of method subjected to critique and
clarification
          [-that method] that leads from the intuitively given
surrounding world to
          the idealization of mathematics and to the interpretation of
these
          idealizations as objective being? Einstein's revolutionary
innovations
          concern the formulae through which the idealized and naively
objectified
          physis is dealt with. But how formula in general, how
mathematical
          objectification in general, receive meaning on the foundation
of life and
          intuitively given surrounding world-of this we learn nothing;
and thus
          Einstein does not reform the space and time in which our vital
life runs its
          course.

          Weinberg might agree with Husserl above regarding the
separation of
          "mathematical objectification" from cultural considerations.
But Husserl
          demonstrates that the interchange between the mathematization
of
          phenomena and the phenomena themselves occurs on a much more
          fundamental level and yet, in spite of this, only effects the
cultural and
          societal shape of human existence and not its "vital life."
People like
          Weinberg tend to confuse the hegemony of technology and
retrograde
          considerations of its scientific origins with more fundamental
changes,
          when in reality that hegemony is no more than a cultural
condition
          amplified by its present historical currency.

          Bergstein's "complementary elements" sound perilously like
metaphor
          where a few elements are drawn together to illuminate the
whole which is
          revealed as the template for metaphor's techne. The inability
to describe
          scientifically e.g. mathematically "the wide variety of
different forms of
          knowledge" e.g. experience presages the failures of the Strong
Artificial
          Intelligence project. (Note the way A.I. advocates like Daniel
Dennett
          have a propensity to set up artificial antagonists, straw
adversaries, who
          are little more than 'thought experiments', whose
counterpoints come
          from Dennett's own mind, which he then proceeds to defeat in
argument
          though often he even fails to accomplish that.)

          And lastly Bergstein says that "the illumination of human
existence" should
          be left not to Weinberg, Sokal, Gross and Levitt but to those
that they
          despise-philosophers, social theorists and even poets. Perhaps
Bergstein
          had seen the smiling beard of Musil's "first full-dress
encounter with evil"
          and decided that others with more altruistic impulses should
be entrusted
          with interpreting paradoxes that scientists have heaped up and
then
          largely ignored in favor of those discoveries which yield
marketable
          technological results.

          5) Caveat number five (which relates to caveat number four)
comprised a
          major part of my review in Science as Culture. Weinberg's
formulation
          reads thus:

          I have to admit that physicists share responsibility for the
widespread
          confusion about such matters. Sokal quotes some dreadful
examples of
          Werner Heisenberg's philosophical wanderings...

          Weinberg goes on to make this statement:

          (Heisenberg was one the great physicists of the twentieth
century, but he
          could not always be counted on to think carefully, as is shown
by his
          technical mistakes in the German nuclear weapons program.)

          But how does it follow that Heisenberg was a poor philosopher
because
          he was a poor experimenter? It would seem that Heisenberg who
was a
          supreme theoretician would likewise make for an imaginative
and
          meticulous philosopher. Heisenberg's discussions with various
          philosophers, especially Neo-Kantians, rested on a reading and
          understanding of continental philosophy that is extremely rare
among
          current American physicists. How can Weinberg or Sokal who
seem to
          have no background in philosophy and have contributed far less
to
          theoretical physics judge Heisenberg's powers in these areas
especially
          when they insist on expertise from people in other fields?

          Weinberg goes on to criticize Louis de Broglie in the same
vein. This is a
          bit ironic to this reader because in Higher Superstition, a
book that
          Weinberg praises, its authors Gross and Levitt hold up de
Broglie as a
          sensible extrapolater of physical concepts into philosophical
discourse.
          The overall subjectivity of the matter renders Weinberg's
argument
          without merit. The hubris that comparative mediocrities like
Weinberg
          and Sokal show toward other physicists and scientists who
disagree or
          whose statements are disagreeable to their position but who
demonstrate
          a superior knowledge and understanding in areas such as
philosophy
          points to extrascientific intent and motive. Weinberg claims
he is able to
          precipitate cultural conditions from the fundamental
scientific
          understanding of phenomena. But again context wins out and
Weinberg's
          caveats in the form of discrete categories blend in ways he
seems not to
          have intended.

          Weinberg creates his own paradox. His commonsense form of
          pseudophilosophical discourse relies heavily on his own
pedestrian
          cultural and epistemological assumptions. He disagrees with
Gross and
          Levitt on the merits of the philosophical arguments of Louis
de Broglie
          precisely because arguments about physical phenomena couched
in
          language, philosophical or otherwise , are wide open to
interpretation. If
          Weinberg were to train for e.g. read with attention texts that
would allow
          him to approach a desired set of discretions, he would run the
risk as
          many of his colleagues have of challenging his own core
assumptions.

          Recently, I picked up Wolfgang Pauli's The Influence of
Archetypal
          Ideas On the Scientific Theories of Kepler which explains
Kepler's
          discoveries both in their historical perspective and with a
Jungian tinge.
          We must assume that Weinberg et al would reject and ridicule
Wolfgang
          Pauli as they do Heisenberg, Prigogine and de Broglie and the
thousands
          of other scientists and mathematicians that have endeavored to
use
          language based tools to explicate physical phenomena and its
          implications. What scientist or mathematician who is more than
a
          technician has not speculated in this manner including John
von Neumann
          who, though as reactionary as the creator makes us, came
through the
          constraints of logical discourse, to a faux Buddhist
interpretation
          concerning the problems surrounding conceptual expression and
quantum
          complementarity.

          Actually a more illuminating piece concerning this dimension
of alleged
          scientific culpability appeared in the Book World section of
the
          Washington Post for August, 11. Robert L. Park, a professor of
physics
          at the University of Maryland, reviewed John Horgan's recent
book, The
          End of Science. At the end of the review, in which Horgan
caricatures
          Weinberg as "a tough minded rationalist", Park writes this:

          But Horgan ends with the fuzzy, feel-good silliness of Frank
Tipler, who
          concluded in the Physics of Immortality that at a distant
point in time
          we will be resurrected as computers. It is naive ironic
science gone mad.

          I pointedly criticized Tipler's book in an earlier PostMortem
concerning
          the Mary Lefkowitz flap as well as in my review in Science as
Culture.
          Tipler's book is indeed an intellectual cowpie but it is not
the exception in
          science writing.

          Park concludes his review with this revelation:

          By the time the shuttle got me to my rental car, I realized
that ending with
          Tipler was a metaphor. This, Horgan is warning us, is where
science is
          headed. Everyone will be free to choose the theory that suits
them.
          Without empiricism to keep the score, one ironic science is as
good as
          another. Science has manned the battlements against the
postmodern
          heresy that there is no objective truth, only to discover
postmodernism
          inside the wall.

          This statement would make Frank Tipler jump out of his skin.
          Postmodernists would find its naivete amusing possibly
responding with a
          volley of laughs and guffaws through their own beards. Park is
asking for
          the impossible. He wants the logic of mathematical science to
again
          reflect the rational that finds its expression in everyday
experience. Park
          wants quantum to yield to everyday language and not to the
inexorable
          mathematical logic of Frank Tipler's computer extrapolated
equations
          which far from demonstrating theoretical relativism are
actually a working
          paper for those doing research in Strong Artificial
Intelligence, fifth
          generation computers and the like. (The second half of the
book is a
          veritable catechism of the current canon of mathematical
physics.)

          Empiricism 'keeps score' at present only through its
technological
          application. And if you recall, Weinberg in his review said
his argument
          rejected the "technological applications of physics, which of
course do
          have a huge effect on our culture".

          6) Caveat 6. Weinberg admits that he cannot prove the
existence of
          objective reality. Frankly, I don't know why he brings it up.
Sokal and
          Gross and Levitt also do but, even though John von Neumann and
          certain Buddhist sects have struggled with the question of
objective
          reality, it has never been an issue with the philosophers and
social
          theorists that Weinberg et al attack. If they would read
Wittgenstein's
          Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics they would
understand
          why they misunderstand deconstructionists and social
theorists. But
          anyway as regards "objective realty" Weinberg writes:

          ...[T]he languages in which we describe rocks or in which we
state
          physical laws are certainly created socially, so I am making
an implicit
          assumption...that our statements about the laws of physics are
in
          one-to-one correspondence with aspects of objective reality.
To put it
          another way, if we ever discover intelligent creatures on some
distant
          planet and translate their scientific works, we will find that
we and they
          have discovered the same laws.

          'We' and 'they' have not even discovered the same laws here on
earth.
          Many of the 'they', which comprise the majority of humanity,
were
          coerced and brutalized into accepting our laws. Ask 'them.'
Many now
          embrace the technological fruits of western scientific
legalism; but few
          outside of those who have themselves become scientists
understand or
          accept the philosophical catechism of 'objective reality' that
has formed
          around the empirical method. Many people in sciences core
culture reject
          the materialist implications of science. These indeed are
cultural questions
          which cannot be wholly attributed to ignorance of the
empirical sciences.
          If Weinberg's adolescent fantasy were to come to pass, no
doubt
          "intelligent creatures on some distant planet" will 'discover'
our 'objective
          reality' at the point of whatever state of the art sword human
science has
          forged for their powerful handlers.

          But in these matters Weinberg insists on demonstrating his
chauvinism
          and bigotry. He writes:

          Sarah Franklin...challenges an argument of Richard Dawkins
that in
          relying on the working of airplanes we show our acceptance of
the
          working of the laws of nature, remarking that some airlines
show prayer
          films during takeoff to invoke the aid of Allah to remain
safely airborne.
          Does Franklin think that Dawkin's argument does not apply to
her? If so
          would she be willing to give up the use of the laws of physics
in designing
          aircraft, and rely on prayers instead?

          First, no Weinberg, Dawkins argument does not apply to
Franklin when
          you take into account the likelihood that Franklin is not
Muslim.
          Secondly, does Weinberg plan to get to the afterlife in an
airplane or is an
          airplane, as Muslims and many of the rest of us percieve, a
potential
          undesirable means to that end?

          And translation is not a scientifically objective activity any
more than
          relating our perceptions is. As Pauli, Hansen, Husserl, Adorno
and
          Feyerabend (among many other physicists, philosophers etc.)
have
          pointed out it is the mathematization of the process that has
provided the
          "one-to-one correspondence" that by Weinberg's own admission
require
          his "implicit assumption." (Read comment on Dennett above)
Weinberg's
          argument is circular but that doesn't mean it is wrong. It
simply means
          given the meager abilities of Weinberg to argue his case, he
can speak of
          nothing that would help us know for certain whether he is
right or wrong.
          But is the inability to effectively bring closure to the
problem he addresses
          due to Weinberg's lack of philosophical acumen; or are the
          epistemological tools at his disposal fundamentally inadequate
for the
          task?

So, Weinberg and the other scientists and science writers that the article

evil
anal
poetasters
paternalistic
false omniscience
failures
hubris
mediocrities

Now that I've let off some steam, perhaps I should make some more measured
replies to the points raised by the article.


> An adequate description of human existence must be
> sought in the ordinary uses of language, in the humanistic sciences, and
> in poetry - not in natural science.

Why is the author resorting to such binarism? I have certainly found the
works of Wallace Stevens, Michele Leggott, Denis Diderot and Milan Kundera
to provide vital steps towards forming, for me, an "illumination of human
existence", but so have the works of Richard Dawkins, Alan Turing, Sophie
Germain and Edward Lorenz. We are human, and thus succumb to desire,
acculturation and oppression; but we also succumb to viruses, neurochemical
imbalances and gravity.


> And lastly Bergstein says that "the illumination of human
> existence" should be left not to Weinberg, Sokal, Gross and Levitt but
> to those that they despise - philosophers, social theorists and even
poets.

It's not clear to me from the quotes in the article, or from Weinberg's
other writings, that they do despise philosophers or poets. Or do Ayer and
Popper not count as philosophers, perhaps because they are guilty of
comprehensibility?


I think the author misreads Weinberg's statements in the following passage:

> if we ever discover intelligent creatures on some
> distant planet and translate their scientific works, we will find that
> we and they have discovered the same laws.

Parcelli's response ("'We' and 'they' have not even discovered the same
laws here on earth. Many of the 'they', which comprise the majority of
humanity, were coerced and brutalized into accepting our laws.") seems to
disregard that Weinberg writes specifically of "scientific works", not of
belief systems in general. Thus, while many different cultures and
religions have widely differing explanations or narratives of the world,
Weinberg is saying that any group which follows what might broadly be
termed "scientific" principles (such as falsifiability, a combination of
analysis and synthesis etc) might be expected to find similar theories.
Science is thus regarded as useful because it is consistent.

Finally, the title of the post is strangely consistent with a belief that
used to be traditional among the arts and humanities (one that is in
opposition to the usual critique of science's relation to socioeconomic
structures): that the arts are the proper domain of the aristocrats,
whereas science is better left to the "yokels".

Very vague, but not bad.  Blakean, in fact.  In general I have great
respect for the work of Bromige, Gould and others on this list;  sometimes
I wish I could filter 'em out though when the main point of their posts is
to trivialize and dismiss issues that are actually about poetix. Their
responses to Mark Wallaces small screed being a case in point.

Seems to me that the work done under the LangPo rubric is one of a large
number of useful, helpful, pattern-breaking tendencies in poetry in the US
in the last 30 years.  Defensiveness toward it seems to be *mostly* (as
Perelman and others have suggested) a kind of furious very-US hatred of
groups, of the building of collective identities...

Thanx to Don Wellman for at least addressing the issue a bit...I don't
agree with him that langpo is an "agenda" that has outlived its
usefulness...Actually, to the main actors in the group that is probably
what it is..To the poetry scene in general it seems to me to be mostly
a helpful example of serious and unafraid attention to writing.

Mark, you're right, the silly antics often crowd out the
direct treatment of the thing, the discussion.  But I don't think the main
point of either DB's or my recent posts on this subject was to
trivialize it.  Sometimes you have to read through the flippy parabolicness,
but both of us, I think DB will agree regarding his own, were actually
saying something in particular about the issue raised.  Not trying
to make a joke of it or dismiss anything.   Mark Wallace's
attempt to criticize the critics by referring obliquely to statements
made or written elsewhere & muttering "language poetry bashing" is
certainly just as parabolic an attempt to steer the conversation
- or more so - as DB's or HG's.  All power to him, it's certainly a
phenomenon, I guess - & we have had this discussion before, about
culprits (like that guy Blarnes) spouting "langpo" as a murky shorthand
for unexplored "trends".  But harping on poor little langpo & its
meanies sort of avoids various antagonisms/questions. (probably with
good reason - we don't need another mini culture war in the poetwy
school swamp, thank you very much Mr. Blarnes).  I was going to be
quiet today, & I promise, poor blind poetics listers, to shut up
for the next three days unless something really important comes up.

I tend to agree mostly with Mark P. on this one. Especially when what is being
trivialized could actually become an interesting poetics discussion on this
list. The comments that began this thread were not well thought through (the "I
haven't bothered to read about LangPo and try to understand it first, but here
goes...). The few comments since have tended to be of the short and dissing
kind. I agree that the LangPo bashing does seem to come from a typically US
stance on schools and ideas as such. But to see LangPo merely as a blip on the
radar screen of late twentieth century postmodernist politics is to miss
exciting work, to wave away with both hands those still writing that way, and
to miss still more possibilities. And I don't think that I have missed the
point of David's post of yesterday with its, "there is no more language
writing." It's nothing more than a name (and a general one at that which a few
even extend to include all poetry). This has been a weak discussion of LangPo
the movement, and not about "language writing." In that case, perhaps LangPo
could be discussed in the context of postmodernism, and whether that exists any
longer, or where the hell we are right now (oh no! Not another end-of-century
discussion).

Since we are discussing movements and other poetic phenomena, I offer up as an
example the French surrealists where the decidedly doctrinaire position of
Breton helped that school to an early(?) demise, one that it would have
nevertheless had even if not for his overbearing. Consider the surrealism
bashing that we have seen over the last four decades in which "neo-surrealism"
has been under attack. I don't know about any Oedipal longings (He is dead and
gone, Lady), but what has happened appears more phoenix-like than anything
else; the non-school of I can improve upon this work (action over and against
the longings for originality, or "newness" never realized) referred to as
received form by many. For me, the best surrealist writing has been seen after
WWII in this country and in others. Just an example.

If David Bromige thinks we should let the mere matter of the non-existence
of a phenomenon interfere with our bashing of same, he's got several more
thinks coming.  (Was, at it happens, just thinking of him.)  Let me adduce
here the final sentences of the entry on "nothing" in the Encyclopedia of
Philosophy, where Peter heath remarks:

"If nothing whatsoever existed, there would be no problem and no answer,
and the anxieties even of existential philosophers would be permanently
laid to rest.  Since they are not, there is evidently _nothing to worry
about_.  But that itself should be enough to keep an existentialist happy.
Unless the solution be, as some have suspected, that it is not nothing that
has been worrying them, but they who have been worrying it."

and, after all, isn't disappearing from the world exactly the kind of thing
a language writer would do to attract attention from those theory-ridden
critics who would far rather write about a poetry they would never, could
never, read?

Or as Mark wallace might put it, that never happened, and besides, I wasn't
there.

Sorry Henry, but didn't see this until after I sent my last (the one from
thread escalation central you know). My mail server license has been on&off all
morning. Did note the attempt to swerve in some of the latest posts on this

this is just a general musing on all that has gone on referenced  to
language poetry bashing...

it seems to me that this topic has brought to the surface a very
recognizable reflex with respect to OUR poetry, a territorialness, a
conviction that a certain kind of work, and the authors of that certain kind
of work, which and who happen to represent  the kind of poetics that
[the correspondent] thinks is most worthwhile, are to be championed,
and most decidedly at the expense of not only people and work that do
not fit into the categories of OUR work, OUR writers, and but (even more
dramatically) at the expense of critics who have not appropriately valued
the work and workers of OUR poetry.

Now, I ask of us, what is at stake here? Is there some extra-poetical,
extra-careerist, extra-ordinary value, social, political, personal, that can
accrue in a world where the disposition toward OUR kind of poetry is
different? To what extent is the world as constituted the way it is
BECAUSE of the position of OUR kind of poetry? Is OUR world of poetry
a world of love or of voters or of socialists or of  healers or is it the
world that we know?

What is being defended, and what attacked here? Again, what is at
stake? It seems to me sometimes that we have imagined it all, imagined
the enemy, imagined our purity, in order to give meaning to OUR activities.
We have demonized those who have not gotten around to OUR kind of
work or our kinds of poets (enuf with the upper case), or who have, but
don't find it interesting or moving or to be throwing light on something
they see as a tradition or a tradition of innovation.

I mean, so what? Sometimes, the list's constant trotting out of loyalty
oaths reminds me of a marxist group i was once part of, wherein even
the most informal of communiques had to go out of their way to assert
so-and-so's working-class parents or mill-town origins or farmhouse life.

I also mean: who is really threatening us? And who are we a threat to?
It's just poetry and this list a group of people for the most part interested
in poetry. And some see poetry as doing political work and some see it
as  doing psychological work and some as even social work. We have
room for Creeley and Weiner and Palmer and Coolige and younger folks
and men and women and people of "color," like there are people of "no
color," and that's enough for me.

I think often we doth protest too much, hide behind arcane insults,
micturate (I happen to like arcaneness) upon the "enemy" (ted hughes
still steaming, wasn't wystan hughes wettted here, jorie graham), rather
than talk on occasion about what it is that make Hannah's work work
when it does, and what that means, or about lauterbach's new book, or
jackson's 75th, etc.

I have this sense, as someone reading on the list most everyday and
often too uncertain to reply, that the list is chockablock with people who
are absolutely and elegantly in possession of their own
moral/political/intellectual inviolability who are then (understandably)
offended that bob dylan played for the Pope (and not them).

Or maybe the week has just been too long. But i wonder if anyone else
out there senses what i sense and, although very interested in the list as
a site of importance, is embarrassed by the frequent mutual valuations
that go on, the partisan shots at the unrepresented, the desperate
assertions of mattering.

Subject:      an attempt

Discussing language poetry at times a bit like trying to discuss the middle
east.
Shit flies, nothing gets said. So-- an attempt to say something. First let's
take a chance & say that language poetry does in fact exist. It is not
merely, at this time, a historical phenomena but a set of possibilities -- a
risk w/ a lot of nouns in the way. A friendly roadblock, a fortunate detour.
I.e. & surprise surprise, it is not what it was. The "original practitioners"
(geeze) have variously moved into, sometimes on to, new phases of their
writing & otherwise lives but the reception of their work, understandably, is
still characterized by misunderstanding relative to a volatile (& for many,
desparate) emotional/political/intellectual climate. What the hell is he
talking about?

Language poetry arose, mainly, on the heals of &/or in the midst of two
conflicts: Vietnam & the New American Poetry (no, that's not an equation,
dolt). The media & events convinced everyone "the sixties had failed." Yes,
it's becoming a story. Any case, to avoid reducing Grenier's "I Hate Speech"
& other "seminal" critiques of previous poetries to an oedipal stance there
was in the seventies what Tina Darragh has called "a turning to language." In
other words, a search for a structural critique-- & they found it, in
Structuralism, the Frankfurt School, & in Post-Structuralism-- all of which
were effected by the sixties as well hmm. Bernstein's piece on Baudrillard's
_The Mirror of Production_ an excellent exemplar. So I characterized the New
American Poetry above as a conflict. The degree to which that is true wld be
clear to anyone familiar w/ the truly varied approaches of those writers, &
one can, without partaking of jargon, call these differences ideological. Any
case, to fast fwd.-- what is lacking in ALL the language poetry bashing I've
encountered is a successful attempt to recontextualize the possibilities
still inherent in Spicer, Olson, O'Hara, etc. relative to language poetry--
one ground for this might be to question the equation Adorno & others make of
humanism w/ fascism. Apollo/Dionysis w/out the clouds? What is at stake is an
understanding of human nature right? At this point I don't think that's been
acheived, period.

So some of the possibilities still inherent in newamerpo--1. An insistent &
unsimplistic valuing of the individual, ala Ginsberg, or, very different,
Cage-- warning, you have to be brilliant or you'll be really boring. 2. An
understanding of self as performative rather than unified-- repeat above
warning. Third, & perhaps most interesting to me, a demonstration of the ways
in which language/new american poetics are a continuum, each implying &
partaking of the other.

None of these possibilities exclude another, & certainly there are more, just
as there are more possibilities w/in the techniques that are more often
identified w/ language poetry. In any case, whatever one does, no jury will
come back on these questions any time soon, & actually, it's pretty unlikely
one will be appointed.

Who are thinking of? I know a number of poets who employ
surrealist technique or have written, in varying ways, surrealist
poems--but none come to mind who are solely surrealist.

really & truly on the night Bob Dylan played in Baloney for the Pope

had not played for me but was on the cover of the Times Baloney section) -

to your point about the continuum between nudamurican & langpoo -

would you agree that one link between these kinds of poetry is a sort of
autonomy or distancing - emphasized by what you say the performative or
play aspect of it all - that there is a circle drawn around it, there is
not going to be a simple realism - you are going to have to enjoy it for
what it is & it's not going to help you with your life or solve the world's
problems except as it is - for me this is reflected especially clearly in
the "NY school" types - Teddy Bearigan & the St. Marks home away from home -
whereas the langpoos were more interested in theory - but there is, as you
say, this link, this stretch-of-paw, shall we say, between the Teddy Bears

No, none come to my mind either (other than maybe Philip Lamantia in the 50s).
I'm sure it is intentional that those who employ(-ed) surrealist technique did
not wish to be considered Solely surrealist per se. Of course we all know of
many who employ(-ed) technique such as Ashberry, Yau, J.Tate, Simic, Char, etc.
In this context, I suspect "surrealist" is being used as label for a poet. I
meant to label the writing itself as surrealist (shd. be surrealistic).

Which poets would you include as having written some of the best surrealist

Yes, partisanship is a bore...especially when no new information or
alternatives are offerered in the presumptious rejections of that which is
"not a part."  I'd rather get into some real discussions about langpo, or
someone's alternative proposals, on a concrete, illustrative level.  Facile
judgements really are a bore.

In order to do justice to your question, that would be a long reply! In short,
Breton had little tolerance for what he considered eccentrics and others whose
views differed from his (including political views). People like Robert Desnos,
Antonin Artaud, Dali, Aragon, and that's just the beginning. I liked to read
him, but had to come to grips with the intolerance of individualism I saw.
Respect much of what he tried to do, rather than what he actually did.
Doctrinaire the way I use it means school rules (my manifesto or the highway).
Rene Char, who was one of the surrealists until '34, wrote interesting poetry
and prose upto the eighties having the influence of surrealism. I have already
posted before with the others who have been influenced, and that I like.

Hi folks,

I'll keep this short.

Periplum has released 2 CDs this year: one is the second release by Jeff
Greinke & Land (Dennis Rea, Lesli Dalaba, Ed Pias, George Soler, Bill Moyer
and Greg Gilmore), called Archipelago with eight group compositions &
Suspended Music, a collaboration between the Deep Listening Band (Pauline
Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, David Gamper) & Ellen Fullman & the Long String
Instrument featuring both groups playing new compositions by Oliveros &
Fullman.

I'm offering these to list members for US$14 including postage for either
disc or US$26 including postage for both.

E-mail inquiries to <herb@eskimo.com>, checks/money orders to Periplum,
POBox 95678, Seattle, WA 98145 USA.

Forthcoming releases, out in early 98, include a CD of interactive computer
music pieces by Canadian composer Martin Bartlett & a series of songs for
voice and piano by eleven US composers including John Luther Adams, Peter
Garland, Robin Holcomb, David Mahler, Maggi Payne, Susan Stenger.  Affter
that a few surprises, including some things that may be particularly
pertinent to this list.

Bests,

Herb

                                Above the world-weary horizons

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently about 500 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. We
also encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear (see section 9 below).=20


Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at
POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


___________________________________________________________


2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the
author.


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.



Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted
Poetics message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to
receive ONE message each day, which would include all messages posted to
the list for that day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line
message (no subject line) to


                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and
you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"


set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources
in the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts,
and direct connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The
Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an
extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as well
as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year
or search them for specific information. Your interface will allow you to
print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to
participate! Send a list of your press/publications to
glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.=20
If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any
Poetics posts.


Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a

publications.

Allthough I haven't read all of the recent posts on "Language Bashing",
Michael Coffey's amazingly interesting discussion of this tired warhorse
of a topic happily made  mention of the terrific Jackson Mac Low 75th
Birthday
Celebration which included good things to eat, including a huge birthday
cake, and readings and performances by Jackson, Anne Tardos and many
others, hosted by New York University. For those who could not be there be
advised to quickly go out and console yourself and regale yourself with
the premier issue of Crayon
edited by Andrew Levy and Bob Harrison. The 304 page tome is packed with
good writing honoring, discussing and celebrating Jackson's work, and also
includes an excellently produced CD with terrific music by Jackson and
Anne Tardos, Andy Levy, Jim Staley and many others. The mag contains a
collaboration by Steve Benson and Jackson, poems by Charles Bernstein, Dan
Farrell,Rod Smith, Martine Bellen, Joan Retallack, Jeff Derkson, Jena
Osman,Beth
Anderson,Rosemarie Waldrop and many others, a longish interview,an
intelligent and useful discussion of Jackson's anarchism in relation to
his poetics by Louis Cabri, a complete bibliography , a witty
time-line biography
of Jackson by David Bromige, a photo of Jackson taken by Allen Ginsberg,
a complete discography,an interesting class presentation of Jackson's work
by Ammiel Alcalay-from Jerusalem!- and much much more. It is lushly
and conscientiously produced-in short, a steal at the modest price of
$20. Write to Andy Levy at 144 Union Street, 2cd Floor, Brooklyn,

speaking of music and herb, i just came from a bracing klezmatics concert.
what fun.  they rocked the minneapolis audience, a lot of folkie hippies
(cuz of the venue, a nonprofit "cultural center" that specializes in "world
music"), some very young gay punkish kids, some recent russian jewish
immigrants with big jewelry, some regular jewish folks (but not a lot cuz
it was friday night) and lots of non jews.  when one of the klezmorim asked
how many folks spoke yiddish, i didn't see a single hand go up.

Dear Tom. I'm no cultural theorist. I came into these bad habits on my
own. Some of my sources are unknown or of only marginal interest to
social theorists. If you had read some of the sources I sight in my
piece you would indeed see that the current scientific community
demonstrates the qualities that you have catalogued with marvelous
concision in your message. "Evil" is Musil's word, though I concur.
Musil was a scientist. "Anal" refers to Logical Positivists who were
philosophers not scientists. It is widely accepted that their project
collapsed some years back yet the Strong Artificial Intelligence
community has yet to get the message. Have you read John von Neumann's
Self-Reproducing Automata? "Poetasters" just means scientists are people
who have not dedicated themselves to the craft of poetry but avail
themselves of the opportunity to wax poetic by virtue of the primacy of
the sciences not because of any special poetic gift they possess or
rigor applied. Popular books of science ARE often sloppy and even
ridiculous. Remainder lists are littered with the crap. Read John Casti
comparing Tosca to The Prisoners Dilemma Game. "Paternalistic?" Read
Gross and Levitt's Higher Superstition.I challenge you to find a more
condescending, smug and gratuitous book while making naked appeals to
powerful economic and political interests with the sole motive of
silencing a relatively powerless and somewhat misguided group of
academics. My concern is not for cultural theorists. If I sound smug,
Damn right. I give as good as I get. It was physicists themselves that
raised the questions that cultural theorists have latched onto through
several generations of discussion. Scientists as "Failures?" Go to a
hundred and tenth and Broadway and take a deep breath. Its not so much
that science has failed as that it has so thoroughly succeeded. What
alternatives are left. Certainly, people like you and I have no real
stake in the discourse. It is "hubris" to be told by the Grosses and
Levitts that outside opinions carry no weight in discussion on matters
that effect us. We are allowed a civic consciousness on matters of
science as long as it doesn't adversely effect the economic bonanza of
science and technology. But we are forbidden philosophical opinions even
when it is obvious that in matters that inevitably require
epistemoligcal and hermeneutic tools, scientists have many well endowed
forums yet no special knowledge or insights. Hence, Weinberg who knows
nothing about the vast philosophical and epistemological grounding that
his statements would require to make a modicum of sense is given space
in the New York Review of Books on the basis of work largely irrelavant
to the matters he discusses. What's embarrassing and dangerous about
Weinberg's piece is that he seems to be unaware of this. I guess the
Dynamite Prize will do that to you. Or that's a result of "hubris".
"Adolescent, chauvinism, bigotry?" Let me quote from Barrow and Tipler's
Anthropic Cosmological Principle. "...the arguments one hears today
against considering intelligent computers to be persons and against
giving them human rights have precise parallels in the nineteenth
century arguments against giving blacks and women full human rights." Is
this the domain of science or is it "false omniscience"? You think B.
and T. might be in a little bit over their heads. And of course the
authors provide no historical information to back up their statement.
They get to shoot from the hip, care of Oxford University Press.
I stand by my interpretation of Weinberg that you briefly address. My
position in response to your comment would be similar to one Benjamin
Whorf might provide.
Alan Sokal has turned his original piece into a career with powerful
interests supporting his efforts. And career moves are more profitable
if they support the status quo rather than attack it. What's getting
lost in the attack focused on the Deconstructionists are that concerns
about the scientific method have been with us for a long time. A glance
around my library indicates the depth and diversity of that concern.
Bruno, Blake, Hegel, Husserl, Bohr, Clifford Still, Hansen, Horkheimer
and Adorno, Wittgenstein, Pauli etc. etc. Long before I knew of
Deconstructionists I became interested in the above material. Sokal
shows no interest. Weinberg dismisses Heisenberg's "unfortunate"
philosophical efforts. Weinberg should be so "unfortunate."---Carlo

Thank you Rod for a useful and accurate thumbnail - Still, as one who has
been a  Fellow Traveller for twenty or so years, I have always resisted
the totalizing implicit in arguing or asserting about Language Poets -
(This point has often been made here, but I can't help myself.) Whose
poetics are being discussed? If it's five main guys, who are they? There
is a lot of difference between say Kit Robinson, Bruce Andrews and Steve
Benson - all arguably founding fathers. The longstanding influence of
women Language Writers such as Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, and Diane
Ward not to say major (related) figures like Susan Howe, Beverly Dahlen or Leslie
Scalapino seems not to make much sense in the battle of the various
father/son generations. (And gender is very much not the only way that influential
work becomes excluded from that linear history, as my late husband Jerry
Estrin used often to rant.) The point being that the terms, when analyzed,
are much more complex and interesting than the bashing or not bashing. It also seems not to reflect reality - as many
younger writers have found work by the women mentioned above and others,
as well as less easily categorizable men, as just as useful, or more
useful in their own writing, than those who one might be imagining when using the term Language Poet.

Laura--
Well, it's not 5 main guys I mean when using the term language poetry (tho I
think Hartley's book very good it fails in breadth of address)*, nor is it 3
main guys when using the term New York School, nor two when using Black
Mountain, altho I suppose it might be 3 main guys if I were to use the term
Spicer-Duncan-Blaser circle. I suppose if anything is meant by language
poetry it is an insistent interest in disjunction, this seems to me implicit
in the use of the term & it doesn't seem to me overly reductive when
acknowledged as a kind of shorthand which I hope I did by saying "let's take
a chance and say that language poetry exists." & the variety of uses of the
disjunctive w/in & outside & by "precursors" & "followers" is something which
interests me. Also one of the ways one might see a continuum between new amer
& language is a shared interest in disjunctive techniques yes? & the
differences among these writers & their readers relative to what they think
they're doing is fascinating. & just to clarify again, it seems to me no
matter what criteria one is using-- if looking at "the literary field" with a
reasonable amount of attention-- there are at least a hundred writers one
might identify, contingently, as language poets. & contingently is the only
way one might go about it-- no one's gonna pin anything down, because it
changes. I'm tempted to muse a bit re disjunctive manners of thinking but
it's a bigger subject than I'm willing to take on today. At least I'll say
that an understanding of the contingency of any articulation is what is to be
gained, or one of the things to be gained from the work-- genuine friendship,
for many, is another. Thanks for the feedback Laura & I hope this at least
somewhat addresses Henry's post as well.

I assume that you're aware that disjunctive poetry has been around since
long before your principals were born. One may appropriate who one wishes
as precursors. Not all "followers" will appreciate being so appropriated;
some may even see that appropriation as cultural imperialism, or at least
aggrandisement. And you don't leave a space for contemporaries who are

Thanks for your answer on "surrealistic" writers after WWII.  It was thorough
enough to help me understand your post, and I will now be spurred to
read/research these writers, and be aware of the issue you've raised
concerning their intolerances (doctrinaire attitudes).  What do you know
about Robert Desnos?  I'm tremendously attracted to his "headlong" voice, but
know little about his politics, or what informed him.

I don't believe anything I said implied a lack of awareness of or
indifference to the issues you innumerate. Also, I do not believe it's within

Subject:      BlyBashes Williams - Major Disjunction

John, I just found something that I think's pertinent to your question about
Bly's comments on William Carlos Williams' poetry as having no "inward life."
 I thought I'd share it with you, although you've already heard and
considered this before, but -- I was surprised to see my understanding of the
issue affirmed so elegantly:

From "Charles Olson and the New Realism," Recreating the World/Word, Lynda D.
McNeil, pp.215-216

In his essay, "Olson, Whitehead, and the Objectivists," Robert Von Hallberg
contrasts Objectivist poetics (notably that of William Carlos Williams) with
Olson's "kinetic" poetic.  Von Hallberg maintains that Objectivist poetics
were "aesthetic in the sense that the aesthetic object (poem) transcends its
maker and gains its value from an independent state of being, not from its
origin or effect.  In contrast, Olson's poetic is humanistic: making is not
less valuable than what is made."  Olson's "kinetic" aesthetic grows out of a
phenomenological principle that reality is a process, thus taking priority
over form, and the poet must enact this process in order to confront reality:
 "Art does not seek to describe, but to enact" (Poetics, 169).  Von Hallberg
adds that:  "Unlike the Objectivists...Olson's poetry not only relies on the
equality of the subject and object, as Whitehead would have it, but more
importantly on their reciprocity and symmetry. (VH, 90).

The idea of "reciprocity and symmetry" points back to monistic views of man
and world (subject and object), to Williams' "edge to edge" to describe the
poet and the world, and ahead to Werner Heisenberg's "Uncertainty Principle."

Olson saw the problem of "partitioned reality" in terms of the opposition of
proponents of Mind (Kant, the Symbolists, and T.S. Eliot) and the proponents
of the World or Things (the Positivisits, Imagists, Objectivists, and Pound.)
 In "Projective Verse, Part II," Olson writes:  "It is no accident that Pound
and Williams both were involved variously in a movement which got called
"objectivism."  But that word was then used in some sort of a necessary
quarrel, I take it, with "subjectivism."  It is now too late to be bothered
with the latter.  It has excellently done itself to death, even though we are
all caught up in its dying (Poetics, 155).

Olson believed that it was "too late" to be bothered with the distinction
between mind and matter, because science has revealed man's true relationship
to things.  According to Heisenberg's "Uncertainty Principle," the only way
that an individual can know a thing is by interacting with it--subject cannot
be divorced from object, or as Olson says in "Human Universe," like Herder,
who (interestingly) also used the skin metaphor: "the skin itself, the
meeting edge of man and external reality are so involved with one another
that, for man's purposes, they had better be taken as one" (Poetics, 168).
 Heisenberg expresses this idea in the following way: "Natural science does
not simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplay between
nature and ourselves."  By interacting with an object, man influences its
"behavior," thus thwarting any possibility of a purely objective
description...

Olson's statement that "Image, is a vector" ...

[It seems to me to describe WCW's intention in looking so closely at objects,
and tangling himself up so much with the issues of perception and
apperception.  For Robert Bly to see either WCW's poetry, or the contents of
his poetry, as static artifact, is simply mistaken, for the subject of WCW's
poetry was as much the dynamic between self and object as it was about either
self or object.  He was certainly embodying his existential process, I would
say, even in his most "objectivist" poetry.

Thanks for raising this fruitful question, John.

re: Desnos.

It is the older man who was mobilized in 1939, captured by the Germans,
and returned to Paris.  Joining the Resistance network, he was important in
the operations of _Editions du Minuit_, the underground press. In 1942,
his second collection of poems, _Fortunes_, appeared.  Under the name of
Valentin Guillois he published several pieces, notably the great _Watchman
of the Pont-au-Change_.  It is Desnos at his prophetic, optimistic best.
Arrested by the Gestapo in 1944, he was sent first to Compeigne, later to
Buchenwald.  In 1945, with the Allied armies closing in, the Buchenwald
prisoners were force-marched by the retreating SS to Terezin.  In May, after
the Allies had occupied the camp, Desnos was discovered by Josef Stuna.  He
spent his last days talking with Stuna and a nurse, Alena Teresova, about Paris
, poetry, freedom.

on the relationship between people & the objective:

Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past
Into different lives, or into any future;
You are not the same people who left that station
Or who will arrive at any terminus,
While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;
And on the deck of the drumming liner
Watching the furrow that widens behind you,
You shall not think 'the past is finished'
Or 'the future is before us'.
At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,
Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,
The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)
'Fare forward, you who think you are voyaging;
You are not those who saw the harbor
Receding, or those who will disembark.
Here between the thither and the farther shore
While time is withdrawn, consider the future
And the past with an equal mind.
At the moment which is not of action or inaction
You can receive this: "on whatever sphere of being
The mind of man may be intent
At the time of death"--this is the one action
(And the time of death is every moment)
Which shall fructify in the lives of others:
And do not think of the fruit of action.
Fare forward.

Rod - I'm not sure disjunction works (fond as I am of it) because the
narrative writers whose sensibility is so important to this list (Dodie,
Kevin, other New Narrative cohorts) are often not disjunct, word to word,
line to line, nor are the essay/poems of some avowed and historically
inevitable Language Writers. Lately, with a sense of transgression, I have
been linear and liked it.


Of course one needs to generalize to speak of poetics at all. I ask only
that it be acknowledged that Modernism becomes Postmoderism staring
several key people (or key groups) is not the only story or the only game
in town and may not be the critical one in restrospect. There are many way
for work to have its effect.

The most interesting disjuction is to disrupt that false historical
narrative whenever possible. I say this, btw, very much in support of you and your
poetics. A lot of us are more important than we think we are.

I'm a taxonomaniac.  Hence, as we go through these discussions of
language poetry over and over, I get tired of never knowing what
precisely is meant by "language poetry."  And I'm with Mark Weiss in
being sure that it's more than just disjunctional--or, more exactly,
that it is disjunctional in a way that surrealistic and other forms of
poetry aren't.  My own claim, as mostly an outsider to language poetry,
is that it is poetry that significantly breaks the rules of grammar
and/or spelling for expressive effect.  In my poetics, I rename it
"xenolinguistic poetry" because of the confusion as to what language
poetry is, but I'd prefer to call it language poetry.  For me the
identity, politics, philosophical outlook, etc., of those who are called
language poets has nothing to do with what language poetry is.  Nor is
its subject matter, tone, etc.  I want to know how we recognize it from
words on a page (or spoken).

So, is it more than disrupted syntax, inflection, orthography?  If so,
how?

and Los Angeles Times.  The exhibit, scheduled to open on April 15th,
will include a re-creation of the El Monte sweatshop where Thai

that "there is no way we could counter the powerful impact of those
horrific pictures from El Monte."  The California Fashion Association
said it is writing to members of Congress urging them to raise
questions about the exhibit.

If the exhibit is to survive and tell its story, then supporters must
mobilize as well.

Background:

The exhibit is part of a long-term Museum of American History project
on 'work and worth."  It will be entitled "Between a Rock and a Hard
Place: A Dialogue on American Sweatshops, 1820-Present."  One section
of the exhibit will explain the history of sweatshops from the 1820's
to the present.  Next will be a re-creation of the El Monte sweatshop
which will include the sewing machines and workstations used in the
shop which were acquired by the Smithsonian after it was shut down by
the California Labor Commission.  That will be followed by a look at
the global picture which will include a video of modern textile
factories and explain that not all apparel is made in sweatshops.
Allison Wolf of the American Apparel Manufacturers Association
withdrew her offer to produce the video after curator Peter Liebhold
told her that "the union role has to be positively portrayed."

The museum asked industry, labor, government and individuals for
contributions to fund the exhibit, but so far only UNITE, the garment
workers' union, and the Department of Labor have made contributions.
Apart from a monetary contribution, UNITE has also donated some items
from its archives, including a picture of Eleanor Roosevelt sewing the
first union label into a piece of clothing.  UNITE spokeswoman Jo Ann
Mort said that the 300,000 member union has had no other input into
the content of the exhibit.

According to the Washington Post, manufacturers, fashion and apparel
industries hope that the controversy will become as heated as the one
surrounding the National Air and Space Museum's Enola Gay exhibit.
That exhibit was canceled after protests from veterans groups which
complained that that it was too sympathetic to the suffering of the
Japanese from the atomic bombs.

Action Needed:

Write or fax the Smithsonian Museum expressing your support for this
exhibit.  In your own words, tell curators there that you believe that
the American public has a right to know its own history.  Consumers
have a right to learn about the conditions under which our clothing
and our children's clothing is being produced.  This controversy is
not just about history.  It's about whether sweatshops are to be our
future.

According to conversations with Smithsonian staff, letters will be
extremely useful to them in showing citizen support for the exhibit in
the face of industry protests.

two or three things strike me, and it's late and i can't give any of them
the justice that they deserve, but in the interest of immediacy:

rod's notions of disjunctiveness (reduced as they have been) seem to
have created some blips on the radar, and met with some resistances, to
wit, it aint all that.

and yet bob grumman seems willing to take the visuality of langwriting
on the page, (and) the xenolinguistics (elaborate, pls!), at the expense
of the identity, politics, or philosophical outlook of any given langpo.

which makes me want to beg the emergence of a given kind of writing at an
historical moment (as rod sez, post-vietnam post-newamerpo) and with a
*kind* of politico-philosophical agenda i.e. decentering disjunctivity for
want of a better a(dditionally).k.a poststructuralis...

(and this refiltered thru aviva's very interesting post on wcw and von
hallberg on olson...)

so to throw another worm into the can:  helen vendler has an essay on
periodizing american poetry (heads up bob g.!) in a book edited by
lawrence besserman that came out last year -- a whole other thread can
come out of this one -- but she makes the point that post the beats and
confessionals we have "the poem of the decentered self," of which a jorie
graham or john ashberry is the more fruitful practitioner than a charles
bernstein or bruce andrews.

disjunction, politics, philosophy, then -- or none all or some of the
above?

hesitantly yrs,

When Tom Orange says that I seem "willing to take the visuality of
langwriting on the page, (and) the xenolinguistics (elaborate, pls!), at
the expense of the identity, politics, or philosophical outlook of any
given langpo," I think he (in his hurry) misstates my position.  I'm not
so much concerned with the visuality of langpo as I am with what it is
as textual composition.  More important, I don't take the textual
attributes of langpo (as I see them) "at the expense of the identity,
politics, or philosophical outlook" of those who compose langpo but
ASIDE from those concerns, in order to get an objective (and I'm not
afraid to use such an adjective) definition of what langpo is as poetry.
The other things--politics, etc.--are also important and interesting but
not useful for defining langpo (for me).

As for Helen Vendler, thanks for the tip.  If I can get hold of her
essay, it'd be fun to read, but I don't expect it to say much as I think
she's at least forty years behind what's going on in poetry now.

As for "xenolinguistics," it's just one more of my taxonomical coinages.
It means just "strange linguistic practices," or the significant
breaking grammatical or orthographic conventions.  "Rose is a rose is a
rose," for instance, breaks with normal sentence structure, so is
xenolinguistic.  For more, you'll have to wait for my 5,000-page
monograph, to be published by the Oxford Press sometime in 2073.

yes Laura -- makes me think of the Raworth: "The narrative line is only as
boring as what is hung on it." So, for me it's not necessarily "a belief" in
these historical narratives-- but a realization that these stories are being
told-- so we, as poets, need to try to make them interesting. Make them of
use. Remake them to include our experience. Sometimes one uses them,
sometimes one leaves them in their little box to mildew. But a necessity not
to ignore entirely, cause if we do, there are others that won't. Thus some
validity to the occasional criticism of this generation for not writing
criticism. Tho a number of good things have been done.

From Aviva:
"For Robert Bly to see either WCW's poetry, or the contents of
his poetry, as static artifact, is simply mistaken, for the subject of
WCW's
poetry was as much the dynamic between self and object as it was about
either
self or object.  He was certainly embodying his existential process, I
would
say, even in his most "objectivist" poetry."

Yes, I think this is precisely what Bly misses (unsurprisingly - the guy
is so mistaken, so often, in his published opinions of other writers its
almost unbelieveable).  Bly is still so enamored with the Romantic notion
of the integrity of the individual ("inner life" my foot! he says it as if
he invented the idea) that he misses the fact that Williams is operating
on a different paradigm altogether, one which begins with the assumption
that, as William James said, "Thoughts are things, and vice versa."  It's
the dynamic (implied by James's casual "vice versa") which Williams seems
interested in, as you say, an insistence that self and object (or self and
'other') are determined in and by the act of their evolving dialogue.

This is how Hank Lazer finesses the term "language poetry" when writing about
someone as difficult to categorize as, say, Rachel Blau DuPlessis:
"While DuPlessis's writing manifests certain tenedencies in Language Writing,
her writing also helps us to understand the fictitious or reductive nature of
such a term -- Language poetry -- as that term seems to imply a fixed or
narrowly specified thing.  Her at times thematized version of feminism, her
myth-orientation . . . and her particular variety of lyricism are somewhat
atypical of Language Writing.  Her disturbance of syntax, her assimilation of
a broad range of theoretical writing, the distribution or multiplication of
subjectivity, and the variety of her uses of the page (as a field for
innovative layout) -- espcially overwriting and double-writing -- situate her
work within an experimentalism for which the term Language poetry, like the
term , postmodernism, is becoming a fuzzy but well-entrenched metonym."
I've chosen this passage somewhat at random -- the point is in *Opposing
Poetries* Lazer continually works and re-works the term in  ways that are
relevant I think to many issues broached in recent posts.
One other important aspect of Language Writing seems to me to involve its
transgression of generic boundaries -- between the visual arts, criticism,
etc. and poetry.  In this context the relationship between Conceptual and
Minimalist art and Language Writing has perhaps been neglected to an even
greater extent than its connections to New Am poetry.

Odd that I read Tom Beard's post yesterday and thought that it was brave of
him to voice, in this forum, skepticism about critiques of science, but then
read R. Gancie's post today and thought he scored some points too (the
latter's original post somehow doesn't get to me--sometimes my digest gets
cut off at some arbitrary point--if someone would backchannel the original
post to which Tom was responding, I'd be grateful).  I think I agree w/
Beard (though he might put it that way) that cultural criticism often
conflate the ideological biases of the uses to which a methodology is put
with those of the methodology itself.  I tend to find critiques of the
former far more convincing.  I'd also like to know if Gancie could explain a
bit more about AI researchers not 'getting the news' that logical positivism
is dead--I don't understand what specific import the failure of the
verificationist project has for this particular empirical project.
Perfectly possible that I'm misunderstanding something simple here.

On a not-esp.-related note:  Disjunction never struck me as the essential
component of langpo--the diffuse 'moment' (is that an oxymoron?) under
discussion probably doesn't have an essence, but if it did, wouldn't it have
something to do w/ a questioning (or at least a certain kind of awareness)
of the conditions of reference--the gap (maybe a disjunction of another
sort) between language and the world?  And I'd add that 1) 'questioning' of
ref. doesn't necessarily mean 'denial,' 2) in general, claiming that X is a
feature of historical phenomenon Y doesn't imply that X didn't exist before Y.

And while I'm at it, how come the one poem of Henry Gould's that I've ever
seen (in Poetry New York, I think, starting with some material about finding
a Scrabble tile) didn't read -anything- like what I would have imagined from
the positions he takes on this list?

just wanted to say that, while i appreciate the attempt being made here to
locate formal features of poetry/writing that adequately describe language
poetry-writing (and hope you'll all keep hashing this out), i wonder
whether in fact it would not be equally propitious to think about the
nature of readership (and reader/writer positions and relationships and
'community' and publishing realities) implied by this tag, over and against
?... somebody may already have said this, but i'm operating at the moment
on half a brain (tenure time, weeeee!), so if so, please add my name to
that list...

Yes!

Inclusion is important. Cartoons, Advertisements, road signs, T-shirts,
doodles, sketches, drawings, collages, essays, scientific notes, newspaper
clippings, you name it: anything can and should be used in poetry if poetry
is not to be a ghetto. There are many good things out there which are not
called poetry but which, all labels aside, are the place we should be
working from. In my experience as a poet I've found I often have more in
common with visual artists than with novelists. P.K. Page said that if you
could write a poem you could paint, because they are the same thing. It
worked for her. Hemingway revised by exploiting moments of opportunity in
his work from the previous day. Language poetry can't be so different from
any other kind of writing that it does not have room for these kinds of
joyful approaches.

One of the things I like most about the Klezmatics is that, while they
obviously know the field really well & can play the traditional stuff well,
they don't simply play copies of it.

Folks interested in traditional musics of the USA might should check out
the recently re-issued Anthology of American Folk Music (from Smithsonian
Folkways).  Compiled by experimental filmmaker, archivist, & mystic Harry
Smith in the early 50s, this collection brings together a wide range of
music from many traditions, in turn helping to foster the subsequent folk
music scare/revival.  The last of the six discs also includes some CD-ROM
material including audio interviews, texts, and some films by & of Smith.
Very wonderful stuff.

Here's a Web site on the collection:

Point well taken. Thanks. I take it you mean there is room within language
poetry for these kinds of approaches, but only as a method of _using_
language poetry. If that's the case, then the same could be said about many
other uses and approaches and many other components of a definition. I take
it then that any definition would have to be fairly broad, even general,
and inclusive of the specifics of various approaches. Mind you, I'd hate to
completely separate use from definition.

        I just wanted to add a further plug for Lissa McLaughlin's fine
new book from Avec Books, and in so doing to respond to Beth Simon's query
from the other day.

        Beth, I think what I would say is that my comments probably CANNOT
be taken out of the context of the way I'm responding specifically to
Lissa McLaughlin's book. Her work is a complex reflection on the childhood
and later experiences of a particular narrator whose life has been greatly
affected by several traumatic incidents, though by no means has it ONLY
been shaped by such incidents. Whether or not language plays
some role in constituting those incidents is perhaps an important question
in some ways but in others tangential to the narrator's particular
struggle--which, among other things, includes the recognition that
language cannot FIX the meaning of those incidents and certainly cannot
DESCRIBE the incidents --whether that description has clinical emphasis,
political emphasis, pyschotherapeutic emphasis, or any other or combinaton
thereof.

Thus, I don't see that anything in my comments suggest that I am saying
that "life is irreducible" to language in any kind of generalizable way--I
was not generalizing about anything, as far as I can tell. I think it's
possible to believe that the world escapes language even as language
helps constitute the world, a potential paradox that bothers me not in
the
slightest, but I'm not sure that this kind of generalizing means anything
significant to me, really, because I tend to be more attracted to
particularities (I don't say "individualities," which to my mind would
miss the interrelation that's also in question) than I am to to
authoritative absolutes such as the unassailable conviction, that some
might have, about the extent to which language or experience pre-exist or
predetermine each other.

        In short, I was talking about the specifics of Lissa McLaughlin's
book, which I highly recommend, and not only because it might lead to
discussion about language and experience, but because of the
particularities that are at stake in its use of language and experience.

        Thanks for asking!

Luigi,

Thanks for the correction.

A parallel discussion could be on what characteristics "Language Poetry"
shares with other aesthetics, just so we don't lose something vital in the
process of definition. For instance, if Language Poetry and Intermedia
Poetry both work to break boundaries, say, they could be seen as parallel
manifestations of a larger project, perhaps as yet undefined.  To see them
in such terms might help focus the definition of each. Or it might not. But
it would be fun trying.

Language poetry: A form of tweaking syntax so as to reveal associations
that are themselves comments on dominant modes of cultural production,
including, notably, but not limited to critiques of the production of
left liberal consciousness of self (one of several forms of
consciousness that privileges individual empowerment and like those
other forms is often highly phallocentric) and critiques of the
ideological effects of consumption.

The poetry of left-liberal consciousness in the 1970’s (whether taking
Lowell, Ginsberg, Olson, or Ashberry; the so called "deep-image" school
or ethnopoetics as a model) embraced a wide variety of disjunctive
strategies, central to these was some idea of getting naked and
discovering the self, of mapping some holistic idea of self on the
cosmos (call this self-actualization or "individuation") or confessing
to  individual fragmentation of holistic consciousness (call this
"schizophrenic posturing" if you want). Do not take this last sentence
as a way of debunking the psychological realities of either
individuation or schizophrenia, please. However, that consciousness
rooted in some notion of holism (essentially Emersonian, essentially
nostalgic), as a result of Vietnam-era and immediate post-Vietnam era
politics (critiques of government, corporations, gender and race
inequities) had either proven itself to be synonymous with failed
middle-class liberalism or had retrenched to the level of the local
community. So, if you started to publish around the time of Regan’s
election, the old forms of disjunction seemed tired and self-serving.

The thing about language poetry then, the thing that it got to before,
wide-spread academic understanding of deconstruction or
post-structuralism, was a use of language (of a language that had been
entirely co-opted, shaped for market purposes, for political purposes,
etc) against itself; certainly it was a project that did not propose an
alternative through disjunction but instead aimed to reveal social facts
through tweaking, through setting fragments of received language against
one another, sometimes with humor, most significantly in ways that
caused practitioners to examine the lexicon itself (not with a Duncan or
Emersonian fascination with etymologies and secret knowledge) but with
some of that orthographic experimentation on the surface that relates to
visual poetry.

Now "tweaking" as I have called it (or "torquing as Silliman calls it)
may well be only another surface form of disjunction; but unlike other
forms of disjunction, it does not seek to strip off the mask of
self-consciousness; instead it seeks to make conscious the ideological
effects of language as it is most frequently used or found. …

As a practitioner of "PLURAESTHETIC POETRY" (pompous name?) I note
that some of my PP is LP and some isn't.  Some of both is also prose
poetry or picture poetry to throw some more p's out.  Then distinction
I find myself focusing on has to do with how much I try to lay things
out for the reader. An LP reader has to work harder (and also need
not get the same meaning out of what i write.

Regarding this rather byzantine puzzle, all I can conclude is that Mr. Gould

In response to my tentative definition of language poetry as poetry that
"significantly breaks the rules of grammar and/or spelling for
expressive effect..."  Judy Roitman wants to know "Just what are
we supposed to be expressing?"  Answer: I dunno.  Just something.

Frankly, it took me a while to figure out why I used "expressive," but
then I remembered that traditional poets broke the rules of prose
grammar a lot to get their meter right, and place rhymes, etc., or for
purposes secondary to expressing something.  I wanted to distinguish the
way I think language poets break rules from that.  Also I want to
distinguish expressive breaking of rules as in Stein's "rose is a rose
is a rose" from nonsense, or that which expresses nothing (or anything)
to the auditor, however sincerely the auditor tries to get something
from it.

For a little more on this, let me refer back to Aram Saroyan's
"lighght," even though I use it all the time (and am surely the world's
worst one-poem critic--and the world's FIRST one-WORD critic).  This
poem, for me, expresses the litheness, expansiveness, silence,
ethereality of light, and a metaphor of light as the spelling of
"lighght," and much else.  The breaking of orthographic rules makes it
fresh but also yields the latter (implicit) metaphor, which is central
to the poem.  The poem no doubt expresses other things to other readers,
and to Saroyan, but I think the neutral observer (and/or consensus of
careful, sympathetic auditors) would agree that it expresses, at least
in part, what I claim it does.  "Xchhghghkkkkkk," on the other hand,
expresses nothing, or whatever you want to read into it.  Ooops, I meant
"Xchhghghkkkkkkk," not "Xchhghghkkkkkk."  Sorry.

Now to jump to Don Wellman's response which I found quite absorbing and
sensible but in the final analysis not too useful for my admittedly
narrow purposes, which are entirely taxonomic.  I would ask him what he
would call a person who tweaks or torques syntax (or some other aspect
of grammar), or spelling, without intending to comment "on dominant
modes of cultural production," or get involved in ideological concerns,
and--in fact--does not, as "lighght" does not.  Would they be other than
language poets?  It seems to me we need a larger category for language
poetry that can then be broken down into genres of language poetry
dependent on subject-matter.  So I still maintain that what is
(taxonomically) important about language poetry as I understand it, is
that it tweaks syntax, not why it does so, or what the effects of the
tweaking are.

Harold Rhenisch, I think, is most concerned with what various poets do
as opposed to how to classify the kinds of poetry that are done.  I
certainly believe in mixing various poetries (and in paring poems down
into single effects when that can express or be something moving), but
in speaking of them, I want precise terms to be used.  It shouldn't be
hard to distinguish pure language poems (which focus on grammar or
spelling) from pure visual poems (which focus on the interaction between
visual and verbal imagery), and agree that many poems can be both visual
and language poems (which I would call either compound visual or
compound xenolinguistic poem depending on whether they were more visual
or language-centered).

Not much to say to Thomas Bell except that I agree that many of my
coinages are pretty pompous-sounding, and that I can only hope the pomp
will wear off of them--or that I can think of simpler terms, which seems
unlikely as I've tried for years to do that.  That the accessibility is
his main concern in his poetry (if I understand him right) is
interesting but I'm not sure how it relates to taxonomy, unless we want
to classify things by difficulty--but I don't, because what's difficult
is too subjective.  Visual poetry can be very difficult, for instance,
though in a different way from language poetry.  I continue to feel that
defining poetry by the techniques it uses makes the most taxonomic
sense.

And then there's Jacques Debrot's also interesting post which seems to
accuse naming certain kinds of poetry "language poetry" of the old sin
of reductionism  (and I'm an unapologetic reductionist), based on the
variability of one language poet, Rachel Blau DuPlessis's, work, but all
her variability means to me is that sometimes she's a language poet,
sometimes not.

I suspect I'm not responding to all the ideas that have wafted my way,
and am nowtoo worn out to continue.  I hope I've given a sufficient gist
of where I stand, though.

Poetas,

tonight I've been browsing Amazon.com's listings of versions of the
Persian poet Hafiz [or Hafez] and came on a new volume done by a
certain Thomas Rain Crowe (the 1st item listed below).  The 2nd book
noted below -- evidently Crowe's own work -- was published by Small
Press Distribution.  Hence my supposition that perhaps there are some
on this list who could say a word or two about who this poet is, or
something abt. his work -- esp. abt. either of the initial 2 titles
noted below (or whatever).  Am curious.  (Regarding the Hafez, does
Crowe happen to know Persian?  From the name, one might infer the
possibility that he's a Native American? . . . )

thanks,
d.i.

a footnote to another recent thread, re bly & williams (since "Proletarian

close to pure in the projection department. Bly, the man who chautauquas
around like a rotarian of spirituality, talking and talking about the inner
man, accuses williams, the smalltown doctor whose attic-typed poems are
revelatory but require some consideration, some quiet time on behalf of
both reader and writer, of everything he himself lacks. Williams can only
answer him with silence.

Tom, a basic question that gnaws at me:  what's to be gained for a reader
that "works harder," when all the "work" in the world won't reveal to her/him
what the "author" of a "text" intended (unless the intention was to offer a
tabula rasa for the reader to project self on to)?

I don't want to start a flame war here. If my initial post on this subject
appeared aggressive (or defensive), it was because your article had a tone
that I interpreted as distinctly unfriendly to anyone who is either a
working scientist or who (like myself) grew up in a scientific milieu and
still views science as making useful contributions to our undersatanding of
the world. I hope my second post had a more measured tone, and approached
the points that you made in a cool-headed manner.

We must have read different popular books on science. I haven't read many
myself, recently, but in my adolescence I read a lot of Sagan, Hofstadter,
Dennett, Dawkins and Mandelbrot. They have helped form my views, not only
on science and mathematics, but also on philosophy, politics and (yes)
poetics. If some science writers have a tendency "to wax poetic", is it too
generous of me to believe that this is not "by virtue of the primacy of the
sciences" but out of a genuine love for their subjects, and to convey the
awe of natural phenomena that too many people believe is removed by
scientific investigation?

I'm not sure that it is "widely accepted" that either Logical Positivism or
Strong AI have failed. I hadn't heard that the Strong AI community had
either set themselves a deadline to achieve machine consciousness or been
shown that such an achievement was a priori impossible.

I think that B&T might be referring generically to those who argued that
blacks or women lacked the intelligence or humanity of white males, and
were thus less than human and deserved fewer rights. In this case there is
a direct parallel with those who claim that intelligent computers (and I
assume that B&T are talking of some hypothetical future development)
deserve fewer rights than homo sapiens, and I don't see how a call to
extend their rights can be seen as "adolescent, chauvinis(t)" or
"bigot(ed)".

to take advantage of the time delay the list digest affords by tying
together what bob grumman and don wellman are saying as i think there's a
niche there for what i'm trying to get at

when i gently accused bob of taking textual xenolinguistics "at the
expense" of philosopho-political agendae or lets just call them
as don does critiques of production, i was overstating.  bob corrects me
by saying he takes the former "ASIDE" from the latter in an effort to get
at an "objective" definition etc.  fair enough.  first question then is
can you so easily put the latter aside, bracket it if prefer
phenomenological parlance.

which takes me to what struck me in don's post as particularly
to-my-point.  don talks about "revealing social facts through the
tweaking...of received language."

so second question.  or prhaps an hypothesis.  what the vendlers and the
rest of those who reject langpo fail to see is precisely the way the
tweaking reveals social facts -- as revealed in the language itself or the
xenolinguistics.  frankly i dont always see it myself.  cept thru the
narrow chinks of my caverns.

btw bob, the vendler essay's in a book called the challenge of
periodization edited by lawrence besserman.  agreed, hers is an apporach
tres en retard sur son epoque, hence worth checking out.

I for one think Don Wellman's definition ace, and is what I have always
understood as what constitutes (-ed?) language poetry in an historical
sense.  Work with common strategies that does not share the social
underpinning I have always thought of as either satellite work or a later
generation's development/"misprision," with no sufficient appellate as of yet.

What's your take on Bly's work?  What has your experience of his poetry
been?
 And why would you, personally, consider Williams' work more "spiritual"
(to
use a vague, but I hope understandable, term)?"

Not sure if this was addressed to me or addressed generally but I figured
I'd answer it anyway.  I've read plenty of Bly's work, though I haven't
followed him as if I was his pollster or anything.  As I said in my last
post, my main issue with him is that I think his apotheosization of "the
inner life" is an intellectual (an poetic) sham.  My sense has always been
that ultimately he means "Robert Bly's inner life" and not much else.
Take this:

"Rising from a bed, where I dreamt
Of long rides past castles and hot coals,
the sun lies happily on my knees;
I have suffered and survived the night
Bathed in dark water, like any blade of grass."

Aside from its containing a bathetic rip-off of Whitman, it operates on
what I consider a fatal assumption, nameley the assumption that thr reader
should give a shit what Robert Bly dreamt last night, apart from that
dreaming having any function as socially mediated communication.  Why?
Poetry is not speech, not a newspaper, not a telegram, but it is most
certainly communication.  Whitman may have posed as "any blade of grass"
but that pose was one of many in a nexus of insistently social poses.
Believe too dreamily in the importance of your inner life and "the sun
lies happily on my knees" is exactly what you'll get.  Bly says he wants
to get away from "the need to think of everything in terms of work," but
it strikes me that this need is based on a definition of work which is far
too narrow.  Williams knew - look at "Proletarian Portrait," "Fine Wrok
with Pitch and Copper" - that poetry was work; or at least that it was
better imagined as such.

I 2nd Susan Wheeler's opinion & also applaud Bob G's independent efforts.
D. Wellman's post for one thing revealed connections between the work of
the lang-poohs & the soc-artists in Russia at the same period. Speaking as
a lang-pooh BASHER myself, the bashing seems to come from 2 different
directions - one, from Vendors of the Establishment who feel threatened
by it (I mean the poetry establishment), and two, from people like me who
miss the affirmation ("holism"?) denied by "tweaking", who would like to
find the synthesis under the critique.  Call me naive, but I think poetry
since a while back has something to do with praise. So that's another
resource for them's that can find something to sing about in this
foxhole... dust & ashes & unclean lips O hallelujah you doggone sinner-folk...
Wellman said it himself when he said at mid-70s political-social
discourse was worn out & co-opted & people had turned to local organizing.
Well those people are still there, some of them. (not me, I'm just a
coyote) Maybe the affirmation is in the silence.  As in "I hate (dead)
speech."  Silence - whut that? But you begin to see (thanks to Wellman)
that language poetry is not a "technique" divorced from a very particular
& salt-laden & lemon-scented & methane-chlorox-bleached-calcified
historical situation.  & we in it. & it ain't a degree program.

I think Henry's response to my posting is reasonable and well-put.  Thanx.

I also like what Bill Burmeister has said....

My main take on broad discussions of LangPo, tends to be different than a
lot of peoples:  I agree with Perelman and other principles involved with
LangPo, that the most useful use of the term is the narrowest: as
a label of convenience refering to a loose cluster of poets, numbering
two or three dozen maybe, who moved in a certain direction together in the
1970s and 1980s.  Rather than using the term as a synonym for, "rather
disjunctive writing showing an awareness of the formal conceptions of
modernism and uninterested in the suburban politesse of the linguistically
inert workshop lyric."  The latter, describes my work and that of an awful
lot of contemporary poets...To say we're all LangPotes is rather like
saying we're all "postmodern american poets" or something....Gets you
nowhere.  The Language circle made very specific and focused (but also in
other ways very broad and polydirectional) interventions in the poetry
scene, over 25 years or whatever.  To understand where we are (I would
argue) it's best to keep clear that we are us, working today, and the
Language circle was a specific moment, which has influenced many of us,
but from which we are distinguishable.  I think Bill's parallel to
surrealism is very promising in this regard: Think of someone like
(pratically my all-time favorite poet) Rene Char..His involvement with
Breton and the official Surrealist International was brief tho intense.
After breaking with them he went on to make one of the most vibrant and
ambitious bodies of work to derive from the 20th century surrealist
stream.  Tho he's often called a surrealist by people, it's important to
what he did that he didn't see himself as part of that overall label.
(Similar things could be said of Vallejo, Huidrobo and others in a number
of different countries and languages, as well as poets descending from
Char's influence like the fascinating G. Sobin...)

And one other point about why I and my friends are not "Language
poets"...one of the main functions of the label in recent years has been
to isolate and dismiss poets working in a less conservative vein than the
person using the term: more and more it functions (when used to mean
"formal innovation" or "nonlinear writing" or something) as a
boundry-drawing term and a term of abuse.

All of that said, there's lots about the Language circle's work and theory
that is rich and worth discussing.  As a left activist I have more than
once meditated here about the political connection, for instance, and the
concept of unfinished work as inherently radical and democratic
(challenging the reader to take part in "finishing" the poem, rather than
stonily accepting its "authority" as a great work of art, a sort of
intellectual boss..) and the interesting parallels to Brecht's esthetic
ideas.

Etc...

Rod,

I thought yours was an excellent post.  Yes, insofar as we're looking back
at the last 40 years of poetry in this country, to ask ourselves where we
are, the single most fruitful exercise is (as you say) to ask how the more
austere anti-"voice" LangPo creates synthesis points/interference
patterns/eddys/undercurrents against the broad humanisms of the "New
American Poetry" currents.

Many of us still feel edgy (pun wasn't intended) about the way soporific
academic mainstreamers champion what they feel unthreatened by, in the
work of a Ginsberg, say.  All the more reason (to bring this thread back
to the person who started it) to value work which seems especially to be
an extension in contemporary terms of the sharp springy colloquialism of a
Ted Berrigan--such as the new Wallace book Aldon has alluded to, Nothing
Happened and Beside I Wasn't There, which I strongly recommend to the
Listpersons....

Bravo David B for that post & the reprints. But especially for such a pithy
'placing' of Bly & his failure of sense, let alone reading.

Yup: those poems are 'containers/containments of "social urgency"' but they
also do a lot more. which is also true of many kinds of langpo (& certainly
whatever we call Rachel Blau duPlessis's often amazing work). I admire Bob
Grumman's passion for taxonomy but remain more intrigued myself by the work
that crosses boundaries... taxonomic ones as much as any...

I really like Jacques Debrot's mention of Rachel Blau DuPlessis, as a
test-case in relation to Language Poetry...She is indeed (as the passage
he quotes suggests) closely related to LangPo as a stylistic moment in US
poetry, and moving beyond it in her way of problematizing politix and
feminism, and self identity and social identity; non-linear music weaves a
pattern of social turmoils....

I have not seen a collected grouping, but I've been reading the "Drafts"
sequence in many little magazines, for some years now, and they strike me
as maybe about the most exciting poetry project going...BTW..

Yes,....I also thought that Don's post was helpful and interesting; and I
believe you're right that there are different moments in the flow of
poetic tactics...In fact, the eary work of Clark Coolidge and Susan Howe
(with Palmer somewhere in the middle??) define two points, one very
political the other not (on the surface); and this dual nature can be seen
in later developments after 1972...But nonetheless, as you say, the core
of work the Language circle did thereafter was highly political; and later
poets influenced by them have not always cared about that skein of
concerns...

Mike M's reply about Bly's work was good.....

It overlaps considerably in its basic points with a very polemical piece
by Eliot Weinberger which is included in his book Written Reaction.  I
have many, many problems with Weinberger on other specific poetry issues
(politically he and I are pretty much marching in the same left wing, and
about politix he is often eloquent and passionate); ....But I enjoyed the
pissed-off Bly essay a lot, and recommend it as an extension of what Mike
says about the many problems in Bly's poetry...

The only thing I would add is about the specific music of Bly's work, the
actual verse (and prose) per se..There is a quiet stillness which he wants
to derive from the surrealist idiom (and from the hispanic and
scandanavian poets he has translated, sometimes not too badly); I
understand the attraction of this sort of hushed terseness..(The

But that's an important point.  Is there something to be expressed?  My
vague and not very precise notion of langpo is that the notion of
"something to be expressed" just isn't present in this sort of poetry,
whether we want to call it language or post-language or proto-post-language
or whatever.

i for three found don's post helpful, the kind of thing one can gve to
students to help them "get it."  after all is said and done, though, and i
know we've gone round and round on this, while langpo clearly has a

everyday, as if that latter huge welter of "stuff" were too hopelessly
contaminated to engage (stuff like identity, etc).  i can't help but wonder
about this, though i myself am an aesthete rather than a politico when
all's said and done.  i guess one reason i keep yammering on and on about
cultural studies is that i'm not sure a poetics can do "it" all on its own.

While i don't want to push the analogy too hard, it seems to me these two
opinions were often in the air in Jackson Pollock's early years.  Still in
the air in many quarters.
But come to think of it lagpo would not want to claim JP as a forefather,
would it (theyor he or she)?

David Israel,

You wrote:

"There are two kinds of poetry schools: those that posit / admit of
>[bounded / definable / atomistic?] poetry schools, and those that don't."

To simplify dangerously, would that be similar to two kinds of imagination:
the one that led to catholicism and the other to gnosticism? One
Apollonean; one Protean?

I confess, I am intrigued by the idea that some literary activities might
be wrongly named and that a dialogue between the bounded and unbounded
schools might lead down some interesting avenues. Lowell gets placed as a
Confessionalist, for instance, but standing back from the times a bit,
might it not be fruitful to set up a parallel system, wherein he would
belong to the school of doleful irony or some such. He would have a lot of
company from all over the map.

Just a thought.

Thanks for the clarity.

Harold

Hi.  This is Dale Smith.  Not Hoa.  Nothing I say here should implicate
her in any way.  In fact, we unsubbed recently, but she has resubbed
briefly to access the Poetics Archive.

My reason for writing is that I simply cannot respond to all of the
backchannel messages many of you have sent to me the past week.  So I
thought I would address the list briefly.

Re: my thoughts on Language poetry, please refer to my post, "Social
Tangles," of Sept. 29 (or 30th).  To simplify that post, let me just say
that so-called 'experimental' post-language forms of writing often
betray the very issues the writer believes he or she addresses.  In
fact, formal gestures often confuse and obscure that which should be
quite clear.  These forms are, quite often, totalitarian in nature,
because they demand the reader's servitude in disentangling the work's
'meaning.'  Formal gesures often obscure or limit the social impulse for
creating poetry in the first place.  My problem is not so much with
Language Poetry per se.  I think that Silliman's impulse was, and has
been, mostly honorable.  And certainly, Lyn Hejinian has been attentive
to the history of the poem for a long time and continues to work through
her concerns for its potential.  But these writers approached the poem
from another side, a so-called 'traditional' side, 'tradition' meaning
only that they read through the complex history of poetry in this
language and others.  But to younger writers I encounter, the 'method'
has replaced a deeper search for personal, formal expression.  And the
confusion of form and impulse is painfully clear all too often.  What I
look for in poems I publish is a finished work that allows the impulse
of the poem's occasion to be integrated into a compatible form.  The
results of such work often are remarkably effective due to a high regard
for the emotional integrity of both the poem and the author.  But, I've
said more than I intended.  My original post, looking back, is more
clear and to the point.

On a final note, I do thank every one who has responded to Mike and
Dale's.  We are currently producing a final run to keep up with the
demand from many on this list ranging from Juliana Spahr to Anselm
Hollo.  Thank you all for your support.

In Absentia,
Dale Smith

I have to admit that the number and diversity of the responses I and
others have been getting regarding what language poetry is has me pretty
befuddled.  I probably need to download all pertinent data and go off to
my tower for a few weeks to assimilate it.  No time for that, though, so
here are some answers to some of the questions that have been raised in
my direction, first Judy Roitman's about what langpo is expressing.  In
my first message about that I did go on to show what one possibly
language poem was expressing, and say a few things about what I meant
when I used the term, "expressing."  I should add now that I also use
the term to distinguish langpo that uses some kind of broken syntax to
express something (a feeling, a philosophical stance, an image,
whatever) from poetry that break syntax to break syntax, or to follow
some rule (an example would be someone who switched verbs with subjects
throughout an
appropriated text, which would be a use of langpo technique but not
necessarily expressive; an would be example someone switched who verbs
with subjects throughout an appropriated text, would which be a use of
langpo technique but not necessarily expressive--as this last is not, so
far as I can see; I mean, the line is still expressive, but the
re-arrangement of words has not increased its expressiveness; or, if it
has, I still believe in theory that some langpo technique could be used
that didn't increase a text's expressiveness).  Just to make sure to
confuse everyone else as much as I've been, I'll add that expressiveness
for me means the ability to express more than nonsense or nothingness or
what-it-is, the latter being what "jshdntuie" might be said to
express--that is, "jshdntuie," expresses "jshdntuie."  I wouldn't say it
does but there are those who would.

I can't understand how a poem could not express something.  If
"something to be expressed" isn't present in language poetry, what is?
I can understand music or sound poetry, or painting or visual poetry,
being itself, and not expressing something, but I can't understand
poetry's doing that since poetry must contain words (I think) and words
must express something, being symbols.  I admit to feeling particularly
fuddled here.  And missing something useful.

David Israel's suggestion that we just call language poetry
postmodernist poetry
is HORRIBLE!!!  The term is too broad and confused.  And stupidly
time-dependent.  The only worse literary term I know of is "New
Criticism," which is now, what: 60-years-old?  My own taxonomic tactic
is to call most of the newest poetry (but also surrealist poetry)
"burstnorm poetry," and make language poetry a subclass of that, renamed
to avoid confusion, and because the term, "language poetry," is used to
many incompatible ways to be of much use.
Then I break it down further, based on what techniques are used.

To Tom Orange's question as to whether one can put aside questions of
things like Don Wellman's "critiques of production," I say, "Sure."
Those things are just subject matter, useless taxonomically because any
poem of any kind can be about anything.  It is, for me, the least
descriptively important thing that can be said about a poem--but it's
always available: one can always throw in what a poem is about when
describing it.  For instance: One can say of a poem that it is a
"variant-pronoun poem" (a kind of "xenolinguistic poem") critiquing,
say, the commodification of middle initials.

Again, I don't think I've covered everything I ought to have.  Apologies
to those whose points I've scanted, but I'm already ready for bed.

Maria, what would be typical or likely course titles for Asian American
Studies?

How would the American studies program deal with works by Asian Americans
or Asians in America writing about America in Asian languages?

Is it a new program or already existing?

Kevin--I don't have the Chicago Review citation here--it's at home. Get
Sagetrieb 14.3 too--picture of Johnson on the cover, piece by him on
Bunting's Briggflatts, long piece on ARK by Peter O'Leary, and a review of
ARK by William Benton. Actually, here's the citation: Chicago Review 42.1
(1996), "An Interview With R.J." by Peter O'Leary. There's also a monograph
by Dirk Stratton "Ronald Johnson" Boise State U Western Writers Series No.
122 (1996). etc., Sylvester

You are referring to volume 41 of the Chicago Review.  Also, Peter O'Leary
wrote a wonderful essay on Johnson, "Ark as Spiritual Phenomenon" in the
Winter 1995 issue of _Sagetrieb_.  Johnson also has an essay on Bunting in
that _SAgetrieb_issue.

Speaking as a politico (I always respond to that word by picturing some
pot-bellied Democratic ward boss with a big cigar in Boston or
Chicago....) I simply respond as differently as is possible.  I refer you
to a text like Andrews' I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up for engaging a
huge welter of contaminated stuff; much of Bernstein, and Silliman's
Alphabet, for confronting the slippery dynamix of identity and politix and
the urban social matrix; to expand very slightly my own narrow
construction of the term LangPo, perhaps, (but these are all people I hear
called LangPotes all the time) black and woman writers such such as
Mackey, Hunt, Harryman and Mullen are really obviously doing some of the
most electric and vivd political writing today...

Me, I don't think we have to write badly to engage politix fully....

Dale,

I certainly find your post confusing...If Silliman and Hejinian are
"honorable" then who isn't so honorable?  And what exactly does honor have
to do with it anyway??

No doubt you have very good reasons for publishing who and what you
do...But I'm not especially moved by your line of argument.  Poetry should
have all sorts of intensities, not all of 'em directly addressing politix
and social issues.

All I can do is to say I certainly reject the overall thrust of your
post..I think.  But it would require more specifics to be sure we disagree
and why..Just who is an example of this horrible dishonor you associate
with experimental-poetry-in-quotes???

It was nifty of you to reverse the usual formula, and claim that these
poet "enslave" the reader by forcing her to "disentangle" meanings, and
that this is totalitarian....I actually find your whole welter of
highly-charged verbiage fairly preposterous..

I continue to think langpo theory has it right (or closer to right) that
inert and linear writing is rather more authoritarian.  (Using the T-word
kinda muddies the waters, it's so over the top and inappropriate...)

American Studies is about 50 yrs old at U of M, but they've never had an

1)  at the risk of repeating myself the risk of repeting myself repeating
Ron Silliman, I still think the best definition of a "language poet" is
that offered by Ron Silliman some years back, repeated by me here some
years later, to the effect that a "language poet" is "anyone who has ever
been accused of being a language poet."

2) Not to be outdone by language poets, Senator John Ashcroft, in
explaining to his honorable colleagues why the NEA should be cut off, held
up a placard his staff had prepared for him to display (this was, after
all, on C-Span) -- The placard quoted in its entirety a poem, no doubt
recognizable to many on this list, that reads:


                LIGHGHT

This poem was Ashcroft's example of wasteful and elitist practices at the
NEA -- to quote the Village Voice's coverage of the rare moment of literary
history that followed:  "Only after Barbara Boxer called him  on it did he
admit that this grant was awarded back in the 60s.  He countered by saying
it was one of the few NEA horrors he could hold up on television without
offending viewers."

3)  One of my colleagues in the sociology department here at Loyola
Marymount just published an article on suburban, middle-class drug dealers
-- what caught my eye was the periodical in which the journal appears, _The
Journal of Deviant Behavior_.  Imagine being rejected by the editors of
that one!

4) Someone asked here about the Harryette Mullen taklk I quoted from in
_Black Chant_.  Harryette tells me a version of the essay appeared in a
recent _Callaloo_, but she didn't have the citation handy.  I'l try to look
it up and post the info. here -- my own copies of the mag. are in another
part of the state --

non is a new poetics Web site. It will be mostly short essays, reviews
etc., with some poetry and prose. Each issue will have a theme. The first
is emptiness.

Work by Norma Cole, Dodie Bellamy, Charles Bernstein, Leslie Scalapino,
Kit Robinson, Norman Fischer and Beverly Dahlen. More work is expected.
Updates will be constant.

I will be adding art and a links page ASAP.

What is there available and in print of Rene Char's work nowadays? All I have

Mark P.


I don't think that "expressiveness" itself is to be maligned; is there
anything wrong with people expressing themselves or working out
sensations based on their own lives or loves or troubles or concerns? of
course not, for that would forbid someone expressing themselves about
their relation to language production or to sound or to the tradition of
inherited poetics, or to madness or to poetry as politics (see David
Bromige's recent claim for "social urgency" for a vignette about someone
who happens to a proletarian). It would forbid opinion and desire.
expressiveness is, when it comes to cultural activity,  all-encompassing.
(One can be bored by Lowell's interest in his own family (few
proletarians), say, as easily as by Hannah Weiner's fascination with her
own delusions, but one can be redeemed by the new ways in which
one of these reorganizes language, while the other does not).

But clearly, there is something wonderful and fresh often to be gained by
eschewing certain kinds of expressive impulses in order to discover
other qualities (of expression perhaps) in the language act. Mac Low is a
great example of someone who seemed intent on systematically
removing or suppressing certain kinds of expressiveness (personal,
autobiographical, topical) in order to find other pleasing and suggestive
combinations of language, which could not be found without masking out
those other impulses. And recently, Jackson seems to have relaxed that
suppression, where a kind of traditinal poet-as-person expressiveness
plows into a highly charged and freshened linguistic space, making for
both a narrative sensation and a liberated play of sound for sound's
sake.

I too am a big fan of REne Char, and offer a pallid translation and a pale

Tried and True

My bed is a torrent on top of desiccated beaches.  No fern will seek there
its territory.  O where did you slip, Sweet Love?

I left long ago.  I had returned in order to leave.

Farther off, one of the three stones in the cairn over the dried-up source
says this single engraved word to the passerby: "Friend."

I had invented a way to sleep and I drank up its green force during the
reign of Summer.

Singed Curtains

Ringed by air ducts and water pipes, a small potential fire waits while the
dust passes through it unharmed, blithe motes ready to ascend to the
asphyxiated attic.  Broken chairs, empty armoires, cans of turpentine
attend to the preparations.  Day is again stoked to a white heat, new
tinder added, but the conflagration only sheds its allotted light and
still diminishes.  The standard equipment has been pushed into place:
bellows, window, curtains.  An accelerating dispersal blows every fuse.
But there never was such a thing as a black flame.

Some line from Yeats that I recently came across seem fitting to Char,
even though of course their politics where so utterly different:

Be secret and exult,
Because of all things known
That is most difficult.

On a completely different note, Robert Creeley is scheduled to read at MIT,
this Thursday at 7 pm I believe.  20 Ames Street in Cambridge.

Michael Coffey,

glad to notice you back on the list; I like your poetry and your posts
on the List have been good ones in the past..(Of course you were no doubt
just lurkin' around, as I do much of the time...)

I have *no* real disagreement with your post..While I have *some*
uneasiness about the word "express", because of a whole range of things
about the baggage it carries, I have no problem with the substance of what
you say..

My little bit that you quote was more in reponse to Judy R's *use* of the
idea of "something to express," to suggest that context, in some very flat
sense, was fundamental to poetry..Not in my world it ain't! Stein,
Zukofsky, Coolidge, Howe, are great examples to me of moving and
extraordinarily engaging poets, the very best...and they do it by
violating flat, linear expectations about "content." Poetry like any
art-practice is a performative set of gestures and actions that uses a
shapeable medium to stir thoughts and emotions..And contrary to one of the
other posts in this thread, doing so is the mission of poetry, and
demonstrates great respect for the audience...It ain't "totalitarian"..

On the bus to work today I was reading Aldon's extraordinary piece on
Stephen Jonas, which in the Impercipient Lecture Series, and which I
strongly strongly recommend to everyone.  He has this great quote from N.
Mackey, which says much better than I can what I've meant to say to Jduy
and Dale and others:

"Discrepant engagement, rather than supressing resonance, dissonance,
noise, seeks to remain open to them.  Its admission of resonances contends
with resolution.  It worries resolute identity and demarcation, resolute
boundry lines, resolute definition, obeying a vibrational rather than a
corpuscular sense of being..."

That's a pretty good description of the kind of poetry I'm engaged with, I
think.....

Char's never been as well-represented in English and in available editions
in the US as he ought to be...Not too much else I believe if you're
looking to buy.  In libraries you can find some other editions...The New
Directions is kind of a re-doing of Mary Ann Caws' 1976 Prineton U.P
volume, done with Jonathan Griffin...But maybe 30 percent of the poems are
different, and the translations are to a large extent different I think.
In the 1950s New Directions did its first Char volume (*not* bi-lingual, I
think) called Hypnos Waking, with translations by different hands,
including as I recall Levertov, Merwin and Doc Williams.  Years ago I was
lucky enuff to find a used copy of Cid Corman's very beautiful edition, a
translation of the extraordinary prose-poem sequence, Leaves of Hypnos,
written while he was leader of a small resistence combat unit in occupied
Provence.  The Corman Leaves was published in 1973 and is long out of
print and that's a true shame, but it's in many libraries..

I've just been reading for the first time Relentir, travaux, in a
translation by Keith Waldrop and I strongly recommend it.  This is a book
of poems written collaboratively by Paul Eluard, Andre Breton and Char in
something like 1938.  Waldrop handles it very well...It was published in
1990 by Exact Change Press, in Cambridge Mass....I'm afraid it's not
listed in the new books in print. (This edition translates the title as
"Slow, Under Construction.")

Another person who takes Char as his #1 poet is Gustaf Sobin, the
excellent american poet resident in France;  there was a section featuring
him in Talisman a few years ago, including an interview in which he
discusses Char's importance to his own work..

what I find even more boring is the neverending valorization of the new
(is it really new?) for its own sake.  In a time of verbal glut and
information overkill, I'm for recycling.  In a short essay in Nedge #1
I called this "inter-textism".  One can be redeemed also by the OLD
ways of organizing language.  Poetry is a locality.  Poetry per se.

Henry Gould: yes, you are right, or at least, I agree. I guess "new" isn't
the right word. I like the old, too, and some of Pound's arcane phrasings,
for example, or his ancient troubador forms, can be very, what can I
say, unusual? strange, delightful. But I think something that one can
define as "old" is already contextualized by what is not old, so its
appearance is new. And so is the 'new' contextualizes against the old,
so what the hell are we talking about.

I think i can recognize when a topic has burned itself out.

I guess since Dale is "in abstenia" this remark will be addressed
"at-large."  It seems to me that Dale has got it quite backwards here.
"Servitude" to the text, or rather, the author's intention, is precisely
what LangPo has sought to undermine, or at the very least, call into
question. A poem by Silliman or Hejinian, to use his examples, does not
require the reader so much to "disentangle" the meaning since that would
imply the meaning is already _there_, present in an unchangeable form, but
to interact with the text in such a way as to create a set of (decidedly and
inevitably localized) determinates from an indeterminate matrix.

The totalizing impulse in literature Dale refers to is what LangPo, it seems
to me, opposes - not just in the various theoretical statements published by
LangPoets, but as is actually evinced in the poetic works themselves.
Following Levinas's distinction between Totality (the urge to monolithic
structures) and Infinity (the open-ended engagement with the Other), LangPo
(and related poetic practices), seeks the latter in a spirit of free play,
etc. since, as Kevin Killian once remarked, "meaning is one slippery
motherfucker."

When you get into what a poet is doing in depth, it's a form of time-
translation, seems like the new/old isn't an issue in the same way;
and that's only the beginning - soon you start to recycle & reconstruct
in your own place, grow a new amalgam - but it's in your own place without
erasing the "old" place - that's inter-textism - it's not new - it's
"talking" to the old - what does Eliot say - the voices of the dead are
so much more distinct than those of the living - only a ghould would
know - HG

What is most amusing to me about the Senator John Ashcroft versus the

thick to get anything from the one-word poem, "lighght," but that the
NEA and its supporters are still too thick to be able to defend its best

While Michael Coffey is extremely persuasive about the virtues of
*self-expression* I have a few reservations -- for instance, doesn't
self-expression as a poetic value inevitably bring with it the clap-trap
about sincerity, genuiness, etc. all of which obfuscate the ways in which
expression is *mediated.* Hal Foster, of course, is great on this in his
essay "The Expressive Fallacy."  Also, just read yesterday an extremely
interesting article on JM Basquiat in *theory@buffalo,* somewhat along this
line -- the twist is that the essay relates expressionism to multicultural
art in that a certain kind of valorization of m.c. art also depends, finally,
on an aesthetic of sincerity.  But art can be *expressive,* can't it? --
Cage, Johns, MacLow, Langpo, etc -- without being expressionistic.

One of the crucial resources of our extended poetry communities is under
threat. I have just gotten an email from Norma Cole (Normacole@aol.com) who
asks me to urgently pass on this information to the list:

As of December, Laura Moriarity's job as archivist of The American Poetry
Archives at the Poetry Center of San Francisco State University will be
lost due to funding cuts. The Archives currently has more than 4,000 video
and audio-taped performances by poets and other writers which are available
for sale, rent, and loan. SF State Poetry Center will be lost due to
funding cuts. To get a sense of the scale of their holding, go to their new
web site: http://www.sfsu.edu/~newlit/welcome.htm

Norma writes:

"Needless to say, chaos will ensue, the tapes will drift away, no more
archive etc.  So we're trying to mount a campaign to let the President of
SF State know that people all over the place care about this resource. ...
Encourage everyone & their brother, sister & mother to send this letter OR

Dear President Corrigan,

We understand that yet again San Francisco State University has decided not
to fund the position of Archivist at the Poetry Center and American Poetry
Archive.  And so, after 24 years and 6 complete print catalogues, with 3
sixty-minute video anthologies (Archive productions), 20 issues of the
Archive News, footage of countless writers placed with many national and
international news broadcasters, viewings of Archive tapes at festivals such
as the Venice Biennale and other major venues world-wide, and now the entire
Archive catalogue on-line (of what is to date the largest literary audio and
video collection available to the public), the Archive will sit inert "in
state" in its state-of-the-art climate-controlled vault on the top floor of
the Humanities Building.

Bill:

I think lang-po is two things: a specific movement and group of writers
bound within the historical context of the 70's and 80's (which has been
argued on this list before) and a handle to describe work which is either
very disjunctive and/or uses the idea of "language" (whatever that may be)
as subject/content material.

The one is a noun, the other is an adjective.

Thank you Charles for posting Norma's letter. For me personally it is a
good time to move on, but it is essential for there to be an Archives
Director here at the Poetry Center. There is only one person working full
time at the Center (only five of us total, now 4) and she is maxed out
already.

I have just finished writing a memo which will be sent to our mailing list
and posted on our Web page. It is included here:


Memorandum


To: past, present and future users of the American Poetry Archives
=46rom : Laura Moriarty, Archives Director

Subject: ending of the Archives Director position

7 October 1997


"Everything that happens to us is history"  is the first line in my
introduction to the Poetry Center and American Poetry Archives Videotape
Catalogue 1974-1990.   It is also the last line in my book L'Archiviste,
published in 1991.  It has been my pleasure to be involved in preserving a
part of this history for the last eleven years as Director of the American
Poetry Archives for the Poetry Center at San Francisco State University.

My particular goal in managing the Archives has been to make our video and
audio collection, one the largest of its kind in the world, as accessible
as possible. My motto has been "Everyone who wants a tape, gets a tape."
The fact that many times I was providing images of the friends, colleagues
and relatives whose readings are among the thousands in our collection has
made this a very personal task.

When a high school student calls and wants to know who the African American
writers in the collection are and I can provide a detailed list, waive the
membership fee and send a tape for her presentation, the whole thing seems
worth it.  When Allen Ginsberg dies and I can help put a tape of him
reading on the national news, again it seems worth it.  However -- worth it
or not, my position ends as of 31 December this year. Due to funding cuts
at the National Endowment for the Arts and other funding organizations and
the inability, so far, of San Francisco State University to come up with
financial support for the position, it will remain unfilled indefinitely.

There have been many projects at the Poetry Center in the last decade (and
297 readings)  and I have been involved in most of them. Among my
accomplishments are the publication of the Poetry Center Catalogue
1974-1990, editing the 13 issues of the Archives News, including catalogue
addenda,  producing three sixty minute video anthologies (Women Working in
Literature, Palabra and Color), overseeing two large video and film
preservation projects, working with the San Francisco Arts Commission to
have writers' words engraved on Muni bus islands on Market Street, and
seeing that the entire catalogue of our videotapes is now available on our
Web site.

Archives Video Technician Jiri Veskrna will be continuing to tape the
Poetry Center series. He will do what Archives maintenance he is able to do
within his half time positon. Other staff will also do all they can.
However, Archives functions will necessarily be limited.

I want to thank Executive Director Jewelle Gomez for her great efforts to
keep the Archives position going as long as possible. Thanks also to the
three other executive directors I have worked with, Frances Phillips, Bob
Gl=FCck and Rose Catacalos, for their superhuman efforts to raise fund to
retain the two unfunded Archives positions, while  funding all other Poetry
Center programs. Thanks to  Associate Directors Dawn Kolokithas, Lisa
Bernstein, Aaron Shurin and Toni Mirosevich  and to Operations Managers
Larry Price, Karen Clark, Zack Rogow and Melissa Martell Black. Each name
represents a world of work.

Dear President Corrigan,

We understand that yet again San Francisco State University has decided not
to fund the position of Archivist at the Poetry Center and American Poetry
Archive.  And so, after 24 years and 6 complete print catalogues, with 3
sixty-minute video anthologies (Archive productions), 20 issues of the
Archive News, footage of countless writers placed with many national and
international news broadcasters, viewings of Archive tapes at festivals such
as the Venice Biennale and other major venues world-wide, and now the entire
Archive catalogue on-line (of what is to date the largest literary audio and
video collection available to the public), the Archive will sit inert "in
state" in its state-of-the-art climate-controlled vault on the top floor of
the Humanities Building.

There will be no individual whose job it is to be responsible for lending,
renting, selling and sending Archive materials to students, faculty, scholars
and poets;  no one to assist and respond to queries and orders from
institutions and independent researchers all over the world;  no one to
educate interns in archiving, cataloguing, editing and Web page maintenance,
and involve them in film and video preservation projects;  and, although at
the moment there is still a videographer, there will be no one to coordinate
the successful videotaping of every Poetry Center event on and off campus
(the activity that has resulted in this unique and priceless documentation of
the development of American poetry over the last 25 years).

We want to voice and register our profound dismay at such an unnecessary
loss.  We ask you to reconsider rather than let this treasured and
irreplaceable living resource turn to dust.


Sincerely,

Such resources are the envy of many poets and critics in countries such as
mine. In the last few years, we have destroyed a great deal which cannot be
replaced in any meaningful way because so many opportunities have been
lost; and what we have destroyed has been in the name of budgetary
necessity. The result is a consequent loss of wealth creating expertise and
of the development of our cultural lives.

You are in a richer country by far. Do not make the same mistake.

Yours sincerely,

Thanks again for many responses to the Poetry Center situation.

Please remember to reply to corrigan@sfsu.edu (with a cc to
jewelleg@sfsu.edu) rather than to the list.

I also wanted to point out that Jewelle Gomez has not made the decision to
defund the position. The Poetry Center does not have the funds, which have
in the past come from the NEA and many other (now dry) sources. It is now
up to San Francisco State University to provide the resources to continue
the position.

Your support is very heartening.

"I'm curious...why use words, rather than a saxophone or oil paints, if
there
isn't supposed to be some amount of denotative quality to them?"

Well, there's 'supposed' to be, but does there 'have' to be?

That's a nice idea, the saxophone. But, as I read in your words, it doesn't
denote. I can see the thing being played. I can see it being used as a
club. Ouch. I can see it mutely trying to speak. Painful to watch. Almost
makes you want to paint it with those oil paints to set it free. But I
can't see it denote. We see what we set out to see. Set out on a journey
with language in our minds, we get language back. Set out with a Saxophone,
we get music. Or squawks. Set out with silence, we get silence. Silence
shines, and there are ways of structuring an approach to it that operate as
language does with words, but, like that Sax it is not language and don't
do what words do do. To extrapolate: if we set out to denote, we will
denote. There are languages of denotation. If we set out to use language as
the object, the subject, and the tool, we'll get that back, like working in
the nuclear fires of the sun. Things can explode. Further technologies are
required to contain the blast. It can become anything. Radioactive
strawberries at Chernobyl. Sun on leaves. Of the times certainly. Then
again, all these tools can be structured to lead to another: silence to
language, language to strawberries, strawberries to oil paints. Scripts.
Where do the scripts lead?

To go further: why use sight? Hearing? Touch?

I too am curious: how to contain the blast? what is useful technology and
what is not?

A cryptic night.

I hope this adds.

In my original post on the Archives, I indicated that San Francisco State
had cut the archivist position. But as Laura Moriarity made clear in her
post, the problem comes from a loss of NEA funds that previously had been
available for this type of position. That is one more instance, as if we
needed more examples, of the cost of the continuing attacks on public arts
funding. Now the university is in the position of having to cover for the
cuts, which is a very different circumstance than making them in the first
place. I appreciate the efforts of SF State to support such a vital poetry
center over so many years and I am sorry to have misrepresented the
situation. Maybe when they hear how much so many of us care about this
program, they will find a way to increase their support so that the
Archives can remain active.

I'll agree with all the supportive comments from the group.  The Archives
are an
excellent resource that needs support.  Instead of laboring the point, I'll
just
make a couple of suggestion (between some bug and a long day...) on how
members
of the list might help:

    Perhaps the Poetics group (or members...) might donate money
    to seed an endowment for the position?  If the group bites, I'll be
    happy to pitch in the first check.

    Has SF State looked at a part time archivist --perhaps a grad
    student at the Univ.-- until funding can be restored?

Mandelstam, in his essay "Conversation about Dante", has an interesting &
complex approach to this question. He compares the words to the instrument-
ation in a piece of music.  Denotation is not the right word for the kind
of multidimensional, multidirectional referentiality which the word has
in the pattern.  And yet he doesn't valorize the "word-as-such" so heavily
as he had earlier in his career, or as the futurists did.
 The word is an arbitrary
flowing replaceable phenomenon subject to the "conductor's baton" of the
transformational poetic "impulse".  It's the impulse, which maybe can be
equated with the _telos_ or "end" of the poem as a whole, which is the
unifying factor in a constantly metamorphosing situation.  I think it would
be interesting to relate his thinking to the work of Montale, writing
in Italian at about the same time, also deeply involved with Dante.
Montale's verse builds on this flowing quality in a very pronounced way.

was browsing thru issues of the chicago review yesterday and stumbled
upon, in addition to the ronald johnson issue, some great translations of
michael speier by rosmarie waldrop.  i immediately sensed some celan in
speier's work and was confirmed in this hunch by the notes in the back
which say that speier is editor of the celan-jahrbuch.

does anyone have further info on speier's work?  ive found a citation for
only one volume of poetry.  also wondering if waldrop is planning to
continue working on translating speier...

thanks,

Actually, I would more accurately say...the power of words resides at least
partially in their denotative, transitive qualities.  Why waste that power
and potential?

I certainly understand the virtues of making language, or words, the focus of
a piece of writing.  I certainly understand, from the bottom of my heart, the
beauty of their sounds, quite apart from any "meaning" which they might point
to.  And I have a great interest in understanding, and consciously managing,
rather than falling victim to, their political powers.

But why waste their ability to signify something beyond themselves, as long
as we acknowledge the contingency, the provisionality, the non-absoluteness
of the "reality" or "meaning" or "truth" they point to?  We're so busy
shedding the handcuffs of imposed meaning, habitual thinking, and
cultural/political impositions, that we may be rejecting the power of words
to bring us inside the "realities" of others, via transitive language.

I'm not sure I understand this passage.  How is the saxophone used as a club?
 Why is it painful to see it "mutely trying to speak."  Doesn't the saxophone
"speak"?

That's my point.  Why don't we use both the denotative and connotative powers
of language?  There doesn't have to be the corresponding assumption that
what's "signified" is any kind of absolute truth, although I certainly
understand that language has been misused, and turned into a weapon, in just
this way.

What??????

A better question is:  why NOT use sight, hearing, touch, and report on our
own version of what we're perceiving?
>

Why think of language as "technology"?  I don't deny that it IS technology,
but it is so many other things too.

The night?  Or what's in our minds?  Or life in general?  Or...are we just
choosing to find the state of "cryptic-ness" right now?  I mean, it's not
really actually "out there," in anything other than a contingent way, is it?

It's been fun to get a response, but I have to admit I don't fully understand
what you're saying.  I'd love to understand your point better, but your
language sometimes makes associations I can't follow in anything other than a
vaguely impressionistic way.  I'm not knocking either those impressions, or
the virtues of using language to create openings, atmospheres, break habitual
chains of thought, etc.   But I do want to say that some of what you've
written here doesn't feel like a "response" that I can apply to my own
inquiry on this subject.

On the other hand, I do get a sense of "explosion" coming at me from your
words...a demonstration that language, if pointing to itself, can either
explode or implode all the old, impacted, crusted-over structures of thought
we've trapped ourselves beneath.  I have to admit, anything you, or anyone
else, contributes to that endeavor "adds!"

So, thank you, Harold!

Aviva,

Apparently where you and I are thinking quite differently, is the question
of what makes poetry poetry...where its distinctive character is
"located"...

If I understand your post correctly, you feel that it lies in its use of
*words*, which require that a poet be "responsible" and tie
herself to linear, denotative sense...

I can't possibly see it that way...If I did I certainly woudln't like a
huge amount of the poetry I do...all of Stein and Coolidge, for instance,
and about half of Zukofsky.

I believe that poetry is free to be a fully-realized art-practice.  The
fact that it doesn't use paints or musical notes is irrelevant, because
unlike you I don't see the capacity for full use of the medium's range as
*proceeding from the nature of the medium*....I don't feel that I have to
be a sax player or work in acrylics to be given permission to use the full
possible range of artistic form....That permission comes from the nature
of art-practice structures...I may not be able to sound like a Clark
Coolidge poem when I go in for an interview for a job as a library
cataloger..It's very likely that I wouldn't get it!! (..except maybe at
SUNY Buffalo); but the space in which I and other poets work with words,
is one where (as Dostoievsky would say with horror) *everything is
allowed*...That's what's very important about poetry.  It is a reflection
of the tethered human drive for absolute freedom; and this is one reasons
so many interesting poets are seriously left (and feminist) at a time when
the state and mass media are coldly, implacably hostile to such truths.

Needless to say, "everything is allowed" doesn't mean everything is good.
But we are responsible for articulating our critical likes and dislikes in
an especially full and careful way...It's easier if you can dismiss a
large subgroup of poems as not having "some amount of denotative quality."
But if one realizes that all possible poems are indeed poems,
and one has to truly make judgments without god-given rules, it becomes
more interesting.  For the mind.  Also for the ear.  For instance I don't
believe that any single poet has created more *disturbingly beautiful*
sound with words than Coolidge (to take what I feel to be one of the most
helpful reference points for discussions like these).  Poetry would be
impoverished to the point of vanishing, were we to exclude his work
because it often doesn't seem to have a linear "amount of denotative
quality"!!!!

regards,
Mark

i'm struck by this discussion of the anti/democratic leanings of poetry
that refuses to match readers' expectations...

on the one hand, a good case can be made for intelligibility---in context,
of course...

on the other, it's important i think to recognize how the status quo of
mainstream poetry asserts "voice" and "craft" as measures of
"authenticity," and what this itself suggests as to the relationship
between language and experience...

in much of my work, i'm prone to talking about my practice in terms of
"constructing a readership"... naturally, like many of you, i feel that
what i'm asking for is more participation on the part of readers in making
meaning of my words, and for that matter, of finding in my words or through
my words something evocative...

at the same time, i trust the potential problem here wrt democracy or
participatory response-logics is self-evident:  it's somewhat presumptuous
of me to think that i can actually "construct" a readership, no?---out of
living, fully conscious and articulate beings whose predilections are at
least as valid, on the surface of things, as are mine?...

this constitutes, as i see it, the push-pull logic of trying to engage with
other human beings in ways with which they may not be accustomed... on the
one hand, we attempt to pull readers, as it were, into engaging us through
our texts (or if you prefer, simply our texts---or simply us!)... at the
same time, we're pushy in this gesture---we expect that our readers,
whoever they are, will appreciate our (at least partial) 'reneging' of
author-ity...

i don't think you can readily resolve this issue... or to put it another
way, this question of the value/revaluation of accessibility is itself part
of the controversy of writing poetry today, at least in much of north
america... and i would expect most poetries to hazard this controversy,
somehow...

for those interested, this has all sorts of parallels with teaching,
student-centered teaching vs. lecture (or instructor-centered), etc... but
i'll leave that alone unless someone else wants to go there...

i suspect that one of the few viable responses as such to this question of
democracy *in* writing is probably some gesture toward pluralism, either at
the level of response or in terms of the writing process/aesthetics
itself... and i think we all understand just how thorny the politics of
pluralism can be...

best,

joe

on a totally different note, joe, and maybe kali can help out here, i'm
somewhat ambivalent about this new "working class studies" stuff. much of
what i've seen is not politically engaged, really, but about some kind of
nostalgia and ambivalence on the part of academics or writers who come from
a working class origin but are no longer strictly speaking leading a
working class life.  so the real issue seems to be (upward) class mobility
and the personal narratives that come out of it.  there doesn't seem to be
much theory (high or low), what i've seen does not draw on the rich work of

I think we need to examine the often-voiced assumption that the lecture is
somehow "instructor-oriented," while various other modes (small group
discussion etc.) are intrinsically student-centered.  My experience has
brought me to believe that nearly any form of teaching can be either
instructor or student-centered -- Nothing could conceivably be more
instrcutor-centered than the putatively more democratic modes of
in-the-class organization the teachers thrust upon us in many of my
undergraduate classes -- They were nearly always more of a convenience for
the instructor (( though the move to journal writing is perhaps the most
labor-intensive instructional development in my life time) --

Emerson thought the lecture a wonderful new art form that nobody had yet
done well -- I begin to believe he's right on that count --

---
Now that I'm tenured, I even sometimes READ (GOD!) to my students -- or
with them -- Though I don't read to them that which they were to have read
before the class --

Can't "lecture" be a mode of group investigation?

years ago a speaker quipped, upon following another speaker who made a
great show of stepping away from the podium to erase all "that I speak and
you listen stuff" that "Only in American do we try to make the revolution
by rearranging the furniture -- I happen to think that moving furniture
about from time to time may be a good idea -- but it doesn't matter much if
our students are herded into small groupuscules if they are herded toward
the same old conclusions --

none of which is what Joe was speaking of,,,, but I'd like to hear from him
on these issues that we both think about a great deal

This applies also to poetry performances. It is a matter of attitude as
much as mode. There are lecturers there are poets who shut out the auditors
by their body language, choice of introduction, structure.... and vice

There's lots to dislike in Gooch's biography - in addition to its gossipy
nature (fun enough as you read along but much of it ultimately pointless),
Gooch also reads the poems almost purely as autobiography, that is, as one
might read a memoir.  So he doesn't have much to say about the development
of O'Hara's poetics.  I'm glad he took the time to do it of course, b/c
there's obviously more primary material there than anywhere else in print,
but I sure do wish someone would do a better one.

aldon, my sense of the lecture is that it can be used in a classroom in
extremely student-centered ways, yes... i advocate as a teacher a
combination (again that plural) of modes, whatever else i'm busy
advocating... but it's best to pause and examine what is meant by
"lecture"... b/c lecture as i've seen it deployed is generally not a
participatory mode of teaching (which, to be sure, does not mean it can't
be)...

again, i want to be sure we've got a fix on what the status quo is:  on the
campuses on which i've taught, the status quo (and all's you have to do to
figure it out is to stand outside of most classrooms for ten minutes or so)
is lecture of the "i am now talking, and will continue to talk w/o
interruption for the next 90 minutes" variety... no shit---i've heard
instructors go on for well over an hour w/o as much as a burp... and i've
seen the glazed over look in students' eyes that results... some get it,
some don't---but the real problem is that even the some who do come to
learning as a result in a passive way... i'm sure you know what i mean
here... dialogue as such is at best reduced to occasional comprehension
checks... and this is in fact what much of the sciences and engineering
disciplines do when it comes to pedagogy, aside from problem-solving (which
is usually handed over to teaching assistants in recitation sections and
the like)...

i need to start here when i talk about lecturing, b/c this is the reality
of most of the lecture-mode instruction i've seen... and when i try to
break a classroom down into groups, and when i try to turn over to a given
class its fair share of responsibility in the learning process, i'm often
greeted by a "but we're here to know what you think" response... which is
to say, they want to sit back and have me tell them what's important re
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness... which i'll do *on occasion*,
but not all the time... still, in their other classes, they can sit back
and watch tv... which is why it's so tough for me initially when i
complicate the site of teaching, and opt for something a bit more dynamic
and (if i may) interactive...

*among students*, i mean... all three of my current classes have, at this
midterm point in the semester, gotten used to me *not being there* for a
part of each period... i get up and walk away, walk right the fuck out of
the room in fact, and allow them to work out certain tasks w/o my
intervention... in fact, when i try to intervene, i'm sometimes greeted
with a "why don't you let us alone" response... after all, they have to
deal with me in AND out of class---online, in the online lists i use for
each class...

btw, much of the problem with *most* of the "distance learning" i've seen
falls under this latter category (we might talk, on the other hand, about
how distance learning *could be* about learning distance)...

well anyway... if it's true that any form or mode of teaching can be
student-centered, then i suppose, depending on context, any form or mode of
writing can be democratic, no?... or does this parallel not hold?...

best,

joe

In a message dated 97-10-08 14:25:33 EDT, you write:

Joe, I appreciated your message, and addressing the (below) portion of it
only for now, I thought you'd appreciate the following excerpt.  While it's
certainly no answer, it is a curious and pertinent take on your question:

"Why I Write" by Joan Didion

In many ways writing is the act of saying I, of imposing oneself upon other
people, of saying listen to me, see it my way, change your mind.  It's an
aggressive, even a hostile act.  You can disguise its aggressiveness all you
want with veils of subordinate clauses and qualifiers and tentative
subjunctives, with ellipses and evasions--with the whole manner of intimating
rather than claiming, of alluding rather than stating--but there's no getting
around the fact that setting words on paper is the tactic of a secret bully,
an invasion, an imposition of the writer's sensibility on the reader's most
private space.

(Of course, I don't entirely agree with her, but there's enough "truth" in
her statement to enjoy a startling moment....)

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

maria, that's a difficult question for a lot of reasons, but i'll do my
best to give it an initial go... i'm bushed at the moment, so i'll probably
digress like a sonofabitch...

first, once you're made aware of your class, you don't forget that you
inhabit a class... and one way to be made aware of your class is to switch
classes!... i mean, you can start out working class, end up upper class, or
vice versa... unlike gender (for the most part)...

now of course the norm is onward and upward---that is, the normative
structure expects this from each of us, in this country... and if you
do---move onward and upward i mean---why then there are plenty of
opportunities to be reminded of where you used to be... in this sense,
yes---being working class can entail narratives that deal with loss and
gain, as you put it... as do so many other narratives, right?... which as
you know does not mean that there's nothing therefore "to it," but---

and of course "working class" can be taken then simply as a subset of those
other structural-institutional realities and discourses (race/gender/class
etc)... this much you already know..

now i tend mself to get very edgy about this term, working class... i see
it as a convenience, as lumping together various experiences/behaviors and
the like that emerge from a particular way of living and working in the
world... probably, as i come to the term, only applicable to this century
and part of the prior, in a particular part of the world, in fact... but i
get edgy about it b/c, depending on who's using it, i can almost
immediately get a sense that the term is actively despised, celebrated,
challenged, or plain misunderstood... it's a rare occasion when someone
will use it the way i understand it...

one facet of being in the working class, at any point in one's life, is
that (depending perhaps on the intersection of your class and ethnicity and
of course other factors) you might very well have been exposed to the
oft-noted anti-intellectualism of u.s. public life... whereas many in the
working class want their sons and daughters to go to college and get an
education, they're distrustful of too much "intelligence" (in my view, if
you haven't come across this behavior, you've led a relatively sheltered
life)... this is the sort of line that leads to a book like richard
rodriguez's _hunger of memory_ (with rr it's ethnicity and class---but i
find rodriguez too conservative in terms of his politics)...

i must put in a word here, btw, about the relationship between middle and
working classes... used to be the word "middle class" spoke primarily, or
at least with some urgency, to the term working class... not now---the
middle classes seem now to be much more various, "salary hourly
professional skilled semi-skilled blue collar white collar pink collar" and
so forth... not the run of the mill the word might have evoked  during the
50s, when you might have had two or three designations at hand, and when
working class folks took pride in being *the majority* middle class...
perhaps what you might call a working mythology...

what the anti-intellectual drift means is that any attempt at theorizing
what is meant by "working class," by those in or out of the working class,
will sometimes be met with resistance simply B/C it's likely to be taken as
an ostentatious display of smarts (recall orwell's problems in this
regard)... i can't tell you how many times i've been called a smartass by
my old man...

but you ask me what's up with this... and what's up with this is, in part,
a matter of what i feel comfortable with...

when i walk into a room and start shooting the shit, and notice that two or
three folks are put off by my language, i know immediately that i'm out of
my class... i just have to drop a couple of fucking-A's and that's it...
and it doesn't matter that i'm now middle class, or that we all hold
doctorates---the point is that the response i'm getting can only be
accounted for by class differences---from my past, right...

you see?... i mean, i can be here but i'm still there, i'm there but i'm
still here---no loss or gain implied or intended...

now generationally, the older working class folks, most i knew, were
respectful in public and around children and around folks with money---but
swore like troupers among themselves... some of us, the slightly newer
generational models, have simply refused to silence this aspect of our
upbringing... some of us figure that, if reading four-letter words in
literature is ok, why then using such words around others is ok... of
course, this isn't to countenance insult or hate speech... but it *is* to
reckon a somewhat different sense of what constitutes "offensive"
language...

you can see the problems somebody like me might run into in the classroom,
no?---esp. today...

"but swearing isn't professional"

fuck you it's not---

i mean, fuck me---

you see?... i mean, this past of mine has now become a matter of my
professional self...

nothing essential here, i hope you'll note... but a set of markers that,
all taken, push and pull one this way and that, in sometimes identifiable
directions... a marker in fact that you might be interested in:  the
response of working class folks to books... working class folks, the ones
that i knew, might stand in awe of books... depends... books that made you
famous, that anybody could read (cf. democracy thread), yes---this is what
they stood on awe of, and i hope most of you will not find this too too
condescending, b/c it describes my father in many ways... but book learnin,
as against other ways of knowing---nother thing entirely... depends...
einstein?... fuckin genius... stevenson?...

well---politics-wise,

paradox, right...

now i've heard, often enough, the argument as to how anybody who writes
these days is generally middle class, ergo it's pointless to appeal to
working class values as a key factor in one's writing (and i've heard this
argument both in terms of content, and in terms of more nuanced discussions
of subject position and the like)... but this wouldn't explain, for
example, how a book like ben hamper's _rivethead_ (which i've been teaching
for a few years now) comes to be written (whatever you make of it)...

even more:  if you pursue this logic---that all writing is middle class b/c
you're probably living middle class as a writer---this would suggest that
working class urgencies are not to be conveyed/embodied/evoked once one
leaves said class (financially speaking).. that one needs actually to
"occupy" (and here you can see where the discussion could easily take on
ontological proportions---if i let it!) a, say, factory-line subject
position in order to write with---i keep using this word---*urgency* about
the factory... and even then---b/c you can't be working on the factory line
and writing at the same time... etc etc etc --- clearly, such logic is
patently absurd on the face of it... one may as well say that any moment of
writing is marked by the relative freedom to write... but this sort of
"freedom," i hope we all know, is often a matter of necessities that owe
their emergence to---not memories, necessarily (if them too), but ways of
behaving and believing and feeling that are in part of a function of one's
prior class (among other shifting and not-so-shifting markers)...

having come from working class "stock" (as they used to say), and having
spent a good portion of my life at the poverty line, my tendencies are
clearly a present danger for me professionally (for example) in an
institution that is only now, i think, really beginning to articulate the
stresses and strains of folks whose parents do not hold college degrees (oh
the history would have to go back to late 19th century anyway, to really
dig it all out)... and in fact, when i worked as a salary worker, i often
ran into similar problems... i identified in many cases with the hourly
workers, the ones who viewed me as "management"...

and if this ain't the long and the short of it, maria:  the very fact that
i'm telling you stories about mself sez something about "theorizing," about
my suspicions re talking about mself in the abstract, as it were, w/o
talking turkey too...

best,

joe

Tom. I have no problem with the notion that science makes useful
contributions to the world as long as such sentiments remain a notion.
Unfortunately, it has already gone well beyond the benign passiveness of
the phrase "making useful contributions to our understanding of the
world." For example, science uncritically substitutes the contingent and
historically bound "notion" of existence for that of being and the
immutability inhering in what Stanley Rosen calls the "ontological
copula." What's worse is that science writers make this substitution
whenever they damn well please because they are not under any
constraints to be more rigorous in their attempts to describe physical
phenomena through language.
I find that Dennett consistently misinterprets opposing points of view.
It appears to me that he does this because he cannot comprehend
arguments that arise from concerns about epistemological
inconsistencies. His positivism is loaded with assumptions that he
cannot acknowledge. He sees individuals who address the efficacy of
these assumptions as being inconvenient and irrelevent and he expresses
surprise and bewilderment that other people might take them seriously.
Hofstader is another guy who consistently says that if he can't get it
there must be nothing to it. Read him on aleatoric music. He is just as
narrow as Dennett. Michael Dirda caught the essence of Hofstader in his
review of Le Ton Beau De Marot in the Washington Post Book World for
Sunday, June 29. "The man [Hofstader] hardly considers the moral or
humane character of great works of art..." Dirda wrote. Then Dirda
instead of following his better nature, says astonishingly that
criticizing Hofstader's book "is cavilling before riches." Dirda wants
his Shakespeare and to eat it too. Indeed, it is possible to get your
poetics from sources such as Dennett and Hofstader---but at what cost?
I don't mind scientists waxing poetic until they start forming
organizations with other peoples monies to prevent certain other people
from waxing poetic about the same phenomena. Primarily, scientists write
popular books for the money. If the public is dazzled by science's
poetic yawps tax money becomes easier to acquire. If you write a
breakthrough book there are royalties. Scientists, for some good reasons
and many bad ones, have always felt threatened by the vox
populi---witness Cassini.  With power occasionally comes consequences no
matter how much you are in favor with the prevailing economic forces. I
wish science's motives were as pure as you'd like them to be. Then when
crunch time arrives they might be more open to others' opinions. See
Oppenheimer and the Compton group in Chicago.
Logical Positivism has "failed", "collapsed" whatever; but no not Strong
A.I. It's just decades behind schedule; and this after taking hundreds
of millions of dollars in taxpayer money with pronouncements such as
"The mind is a meat machine."--Marvin Minsky. And "My thermostat has
three beliefs; It's too hot in here. It's too cold in here. It's just
right in here."--John McCarthy. Roger Penrose has shown in his two
books, Emperor's New Mind and Shadows of the Mind that Strong A.I. is "a
priori impossible." Penrose, however, fails to realize that the more
powerful elements control language as well research money. If the
definition of intelligence for example is altered and generally accepted
to include the capacities of a compass to point north then the compass
will become a sentient class of beings. I think it was Thales who
thought that lodestones had souls. I know it was John McCarthy who
thought thermostats did.
If Barrow and Tipler are talking about some future "intelligent
computer", they cannot be addressing anyone who has explicitly denied
that hypothetical existence its "full human rights." The deniers no more
exist than the hypothetical machines. But sorry Tom they intend for
existing technology to have full human rights. Think of the legal
implications. You may as well think, Barrow and Tipler can't.
Don't read the Barrow and Tipler passage to women if you want to have
any kind of social life. (Actually, don't read it to anybody except
Strong A.I. advocates.)I've shown it to at least fifty women and they
unanimously found it offensive. No doubt Sokal would have some insights
to offer these women.
Finally, to my knowledge no one has ever lynched a CRAY though they are
sold in the marketplace. Neither their creators or the hypothetical
machines will suffer any of the historical oppression that was and is
visited upon women and blacks. So what the fuck are two pampered
scientists like Barrow and Tipler talking about? They've never missed a
meal in their lives and the machines don't eat. The oppression Barrow
and Tipler fabricate reveals at best a juvenile aesthetic and at worst
the Self-Reproducing Automata agenda whereby human beings will be
replaced by their machine progeny. This wasn't proposed by Ray Bradbury
or Dan Quayle but by one of the founding fathers of artificial
intelligence, John von Neumann. No, Barrow and Tipler's remark is inane
and insulting and reveals that moral lacuna that resides at the heart of
the scientific project in general and since time immemorial has been
associated with systems of quantification and formalization. I think it
is appropriate to wonder why, now at the advent of global ecological
events which appear overwhelmingly negative, the scientific community
and its corporate sponsors will broach no criticism at the
epistemological and hermeneutic level. And this when the same questions
were raised 68 years ago by the very physicists and mathematicians that
made the present technological circumstances possible. Events like the
building of the atomic bomb produced an intolerance that makes all such
speculation seem a "diriment to our unific and expanding order..." as
David Jones put it in his great poem on conformity, The Fatigue.---Carlo

I agree - below is the followup post I sent to a couple of lists - Alan

________________________________________________________________________


Lessen / Up    ( Where's my Jumper? )


"Subject: starving to death in a land of plenty

Somatic knowledge has nothing to do with the signifier."

Now please note, _somatic_ knowledge, the field of the body - flows, in-
tensifications, inscriptions blurred among moments of affect. Now this is
not the signifier of the tattoo, nor is it an n-dimensional representation
or substrate. One might consider it a _topography_ not in fact.

Certain an external event, bicycle fall!, can occasion a somatic response,
but as Scarry might say, the reports fall short of the event, nor are the
reports more than, perhaps, a meandering _among_ descriptors, all of which
miss the literal mark.

Here of course I am relating "the signifier" to declarative sentences
which purport "true" descriptions of events, states, processes: "I fell
off my bike!" Now it is not true that these sentences are the scaffolding
of somatic knowledge; they are a residue which creates certain effects
within the listener, which are designed to reproduce what might be consid-
ered a _shell_ structure in relation to the somatic kernel.

Here, in this space, note carefully now, we are constrained by and large
to ascii-text or a text which follows the protocols sufficiently to per-
mit transmission - in other words, there is always an etiquette at work.
Thus (not that this necessarily follows), we are within a land of plenty,
and even ascii-text expands and opens spaces (I write to you - I create
packets, message-ids, a space/shift/slot in your inbox) indefinitely -
there is little preordained limit on this, besides the practical exig-
encies occasioned by various ISPs.

But then, beyond this bot-ulism, this reproduction which may run of its
own accord, there is the somatic, starved, ill-served and servicing. The
body mumbles, burps, gurgles, pisses, shits, scratches, ahems, argghs,
yells, jumps, runs, sings, huddles, stands, sits, or so it might seem, and
whatever the report might be, there's always a _senseless_ disjunction.

This is a _test_ of thoughtless language:

What is your body doing _now_?
What are you _thinking_ of doing?
Is what you are _thinking_ of doing, what your body will be doing?
Will you be doing the thinking for your body?

First of all, thanks for pointing out that Barrow and Tipler were referring
to current technology: this is indeed stupid and offensive. But I've never
heard of anyone claiming that "intelligent computers" currently exist, at
least not to the extent that they could remotely compared to human beings.

On the other hand, I don't find Penrose's arguments against strong AI at
all convincing. I would side with Minsky, Turing, Hofstadter et al in
considering it possible that at some time we may devise systems that are on
a par with human intelligence. At that stage, we might wish we had
considered the ethical implications, and extended our thoughts of what
might constitute life and consciousness outside of the organic realm. I
certainly wouldn't claim that turning off my PC constitutes murder, but if
it passsed a Turing test and you were unable to distinguish its responses
from that of a human being, I would hope that you might think twice about
rebooting. At the very least, proponents of strong AI and artificial life
force us to rethink our preconception that life and intellect can only
exist within flesh.

I can't agree with Dirda that "[Hofstader] hardly considers the moral or
humane character of great works of art" - this might apply to Le Ton Beau
De Marot (which I haven't read), but certainly not to his essay on Chopin
(see Metamagical Themas). And if he does concentrate on the formal aspects
of art rather than the "moral or humane" dimension, is this such a crime?
Hofstadter recognizes that human beings aren't limited to dealing with
humanity as a subject, and can find or create great beauty in abstractions,
such as a Bach fugue, an Escher drawing, or a mathematical theorem. People
who consider such austere arts to be cold and inhuman have, in my opinion,
a very limited view of what it means to be "human". If H. prefers a
Beautiful Aperiodic Crystal of Harmony to a Composition of Aleatorically
Generated Elements, that is his prerogative. But then, I like Kraftwerk, so
what do I know?

I don't quite agree with Minsky that "The mind is a meat machine": I
consider mind to be software that is in principle "platform-independent".
And while I no longer agree with John McCarthy's statement about even basic
cybernetic systems (such as a thermostat) possessing rudimentary beliefs
and desires (my conception of consciousness has changed since I read
Jaynes), I do find it useful to consider such concepts as intellect and
consciousness as part of a continuum. I don't think one can draw a line
(somewhere between humans and the other primates? between primates and
other mammals? between multi- and single-celled organisms? between bacteria
and machines?) and say "here is where intellect ends". And I don't think
that McCarthy would have used the word "soul" in the same way that Thales
did (I don't think "soul" is a particularly useful word here, laden as it
is with religious and mystical overtones).

Please don't think that I'm trying to excuse every excess committed in the
name of "science" or "progress". Maybe I am too touchy on the subject,
having survived a high school science teacher who was a Creationist. As a
former operational
meteorologist, I'm only too aware of the fallibility of science and the way
that natural phenomena resist all the narratives and theories that we
thrust upon them. We make hypotheses every day about how the atmosphere
"should" behave, and have these hypotheses disproved more often than we
would like. We are much more aware of the tentative, provisional nature of
scientific knowledge than most non-scientists acknowledge.

But as a writer, I am glad to have some of that knowledge, contingent as it
may be. You write, "Indeed, it is possible to get your poetics from sources
such as Dennett and Hofstader---but at what cost?". Well, most of my
poetics comes from Creeley, Oppen, Leggott and Manhire, rather than science
writers, but I can't ignore what I've read in the realms of neurology,
biology, mathematics or cognitive science when I'm writing. Both science
and poetry speak to me about what it is to be human, and give me different
(though not necessarily incompatible) tools for investigating experience.

I read an interesting quote from William Gass today, which may be of some
sidelong relevance to this:

        "The elaboration that can be accorded the letter 'r', for example,
         far outruns its meaning, yet it would receive no elaboration at
         all if it were not a letter."

The way I read this, when translating from letters to words, is that "the
elaboration (or deconstruction/disjunction/torquing/whatever) that can be
accorded a word far outruns its meaning, yet it would receive no
elaboration (etc) if it were not a word." It is the fact that words
unavoidably denote that leads us (well, some of us) to undercut that
denotation, to play with the words as if we could ignore their denotation,
to pretend that they denoted something else.

The very fact that words are much less suited to non-denotative abstraction
than saxophones or oil paints sometimes makes it more interesting to try.

The Gass quote, by the way, I found in "The Alphabet Abecedarium" by
Richard J Firmage, which I am finding a delightful read. Another
interesting quote from Gass, which I saw in U&lc (why am I always coming
across Gass in typographic journals and books? Perhaps I should read the
guy!), was along the lines of "Is it possible to write a tragedy in
limerick?" This is one of the best summations I've seen of the whole
form/content saga.

I've been off for a few days but catching up caught yr post and I
thought of this, recently read.
------------------------------------------
The factory, the factory universe, the one
breathing for you.  There's no other air but the one it
pumps, rejects.

One is on the inside.

All spaces are occupied: everything has become
garbage.  Skin, teeth, eyes.

One moves around in between shapeless partitions.  One
comes across people, sandwiches, coke bottles,
instruments, paper, crates, screws.  One moves in a
vague manner, outside time.  Neither beginning nor end.
Things exist together, simultaneously.

Inside the factory, things are being made all the time.

One is inside, in the great factory universe, the one
breathing for you.

--Leslie Kaplan from _L'Exces-L'usine_--#11, trans. Serge Gavronsky

Also Minnie Bruce Pratt is writing some very wonderful cantos of the
real, one I know is one we published,"The A&P" in _Bombay Gin_ 1997.

This sentence seems rather self-contradictory.  Without that little
"signifier" up there, how would we know there was some generality you
wished to discuss called "somatic knowledge"?  So the 2 are already
entangled.

& I would reverse your subsequent elaboration on this sentence.
I'd say - the word becomes flesh.  Why do you attack words for speaking
out of turn, or stones or the body for mumbling now & then?  The stones
long to sing in the archway.  I would agree with the psychologist-
philosopher-camp survivor Frankl - our challenge is not to live
in a meaningless existentialist disjunct world; our challenge is to
come to terms with pervasive cosmic order beyond our comprehension.
Frankl & Kafka are maybe 2 sides of a coin. - Henry Gould

Subject:      defining language

I, too, am tired of pooh-poohing poor langpo, and am not going to babble
on about that.  Mark Prejsnar & others put up a very good defense of a
wide stream of poetry which approaches language as free play and material
for art.  My position is, that while I admire enjoy & respect much of
the work discussed as examples of this stream,  if I think about the
theoretical or "language" underpinnings of poetry in general, the idea
of turning away strict denotation for free artistic play is fine and
stimulating & promising - but insufficient. (ok, Jordan, I remember your
complaint about "it's always not enough".  ok, you're right, why am
I complaining...).

I'm not complaining.  It just seems like there's a potential trap with
this approach.  The trap is that if you're trying to avoid narrow
reference or denotation too much, you end up with the reverse :
THE WORDS NARROWLY ONLY DENOTE THEMSELVES.  THE POEM NARROWLY MEANS
ONLY ITSELF.  THE ART IS NARROWLY ONLY AUTONOMOUS.

What I miss - and I say in all seriousness, as everybody knows this
is my foot of clay, I miss it because I probably haven't looked for
it - WHAT I MISS anyway in this whole postmodern stream is two things:
a sense of musical continuity and an attention to the SEMANTICS of the
poem - the communicative MEANING(S) as a field of play.  In order to
communicate meaning there has to be a pervasive motive, an impulse,
an authorial hand in every dimension; but in order to "play" the meaning
must be musical, have some kind of harmony in dis-harmony.
So what is required is not a blockade of denotation but a manifold
reference, a manifestive manifold. Word as four-fold allegory.
Now Ashbery, for example, is an avatar of the postmodern play approach,
and he definitely understands musical development.  But I find no
pith in his work, no stringency; he's like a huge spongy mushroom
from the woods in upstate NY transplanted to NY city.  Clark Coolidge
is great - a rhythmic jazz drummer of language - very stimulating -
but I look in vain for the conjunction of music with semantics there.
It's all music.  I want to be taken someplace in thought as well
as sound, not have my thought always dead-ended by ambivalence,
discontinuity, and meaninglessness.  These are just examples. They can of
course be countered with dozens & dozens of examples of well-meanin
thoughful overbaked tepid sodden cautious pudgy boney academic
prof-poets, their poems full of "meaning", pathos, experience,
sensitivity, political correctness, etc. etc. for which the Prejsnar
school provides a welcome relief. - Henry Gould

Your way of putting it reminds me of the passage from Zukofsky that Peter
Quatermain quotes so often (which admittedly is Zuke making a point,
using very highly-charged rhetoric):  subordinating the writing process to
a dogged, four-square "message" is to take a "predatory" attituide toward
the poem..

I'm not familiar with everyone discussed in R. Gancie's message, but the
ones I am familiar with are not universally loved in the science/math
community.  For example, Penrose's books on the mind got quite negative
reviews in the American Mathematical Society's Notices (the AMS is the main
math research organization), essentially on the grounds that he doesn't
understand Godel.  Hofstader is widely regarded as either ignorant or a
lightweight, depending on how charitable one feels at the moment.  Barrow's
attachment to the anthropomorphic principle (= the universe exists so we
can) is so obviously ego-serving it's hard to take seriously.  As for John
von Neumann, yes, he was a great mathematician.  That and $1.75 will get
you a decaf capuccino in our little town.

The point being that the science/math community is as varied as the
literary one, and folks of all sorts tend to spout off about things they
don't understand not realizing that they don't understand.

You learn one methodology and apply it to everything, sooner or later you
make a fool of yourself, yes?  Doesn't matter what that methodology is.

Flipping through a couple of posts quickly, my little meat brain read one
phrase as "Pinsky's opposition to AI." I wondered who had interviewed the
Poet Laureate on the subject of AI-produced poetry, and why he would feel
threatened by what is still a collection of fairly lame attempts...

Henry,
I think your last post (re: what you find "insufficient" etc.) was
excellent, and fair.  I guess my various polemical fussilades have been to
some extent, about trying to clear space.  Space for a lot of different
approaches.  I often feel that put-downs of LangPo, by collective label,
seem to be about wanting to retreat from some of the superb work of the
last 30 years, and to retreat from the very large spaces it has opened up.
The collective putting-down does another thing, it tends to obscure
discussion of the poetry per se, and particularly the work of  specific
poets.  A friend recently found Ariel 8 (the Barrett Watten issue) at a
book sale, and since he already owned it, bought it for me.  (I haven't
had the dough recently to get too many mags..)  Norman Fischer's essay on
the shape of Watten's career in that issue, seems to me one of the most
exciting critical discussions I've happened on in a long time..A great
example of the kind of attention I feel we should be giving more poets;
some of the really great ones are in danger of disappearing beneath a
too-easily-employed collective label.  (In the mid-eighties two of Wattens
books, which were at that time somewhat rare, Opera-Work and 1-10, were
available to me thru a library where I worked, and had a great impact on
me; ...I agree with Fischer that his work is special and important, and
recommend to everyone the new collection of his stuff to date, "Frame,"
from Sun & Moon,,)

I guess what I'm saying, is that I value a community of
practitioner/readers, who spend more energy sharing and discussing what
they like, than dissing what they find less useful, less exciting.  It
seems harmless and reasonable (I've been second to none in explaining what
I find bankrupt in the academic workshop APR-ish poetry establishment)
until someone attacks what *you* consider valuble.  Than it becomes
clearer A. how any attacks you don't agree with always sound to you like
they proceed from careerist envy and spite; and B. how unproductive they
can seem.  Much better to use our puny available resources to build the
things we most value in the way of alternative poetries..

A story not exactly about Minsky.

Once a very long time ago I was visiting friends who were being visited by
Minsky and his daughter.  A man had just awakened from a very long - 10
year? - coma in which he apparently was aware of everything around him (and
how could this be a coma one asks? but at the time we didn't) and we were
all clucking about the poor man as one does hearing news like this and
Minsky's daughter -- about 17 at the time -- said "why are you so sorry for
him? think of all the thinking he was able to do!"  We all looked at her
incredulously.

this argument assumes the message comes from the poet.  see Mandelstam's
"Slate Ode" - one of heaviest & most direct of his poems about poetry.
the "command" comes from "elsewhere", from the somatic (or semantic)

Mark, you have solid grounds to criticize me & others who spout off endlessly
dissing things in general.  I confess to being a laughably lazy reader who
works across the street from one of THE premier collections of poetry in
english (the Harris collection) & hardly ever going in there.
    Yet your statement above seems to be a confession of the clique
mentality.  Any attacks on the poetry YOU like are seen as careerist, etc.
So I still say, mea culpa, I'm sorry I talk too much, but as somebody
who's been writing in a different vein for at least as long as the
postmodernists & all their ilk, I still find a productive place for
literary spite.  If you can't look in a completely different direction
once in a while you're gonna get very parochial fast. But yeah, more
positive reviews would be good (I HAVE sent a FEW to this list over the
yrs...) - Henry G.

I didn't say anything was either meaningless or existentialist; I was

this is an excellent post and to me brings this thread to center, to crux /
most critiques of the langpo/postmod strain complain that much of this body
of writing just doesn't offer the aesthetically pleasing, transportive,
evocative reading experience that impassioned readers of poetry generally
want / that's a tricky approach, since obviously everyone goes in for
different reasons, but Henry's post brings this particular response to the
surface / i remember going in to language poetry because it, to appropriate
Henry's line, "took me someplace in thought as well as sound," and rather
than feeling "dead-ended" by ambivalence and discontinuity i felt drawn in
and provoked by same (most of it never seemed meaningless to me)

langpo excited precisely because it demanded new paths, new methodologies,
of reading (these are the cliches of the form), which to me meant new ways
of thinking, of motivating and mobilising -- all in turn a refreshing
departure from the conventionally "accessible" poetries that i'd seen up
till then / back in school, i remember this notion of accessibility was the
banner cry of the hardliners generally against langpo: the writings simply
were not accessible -- to which i'd counter then as i would now that there
are conventions of accessibility (rules of syntax, form, notions of speaker
and address, etc.) that can and should be challenged -- today by us, the
descendants of langpo, as much as then by the langpo's themselves /
accessibility, in other words, seemed to me like a fancy way of talking
about rote expectations, habitual reading practices / language poetry was
one answer to the "what i miss" in american poetry

"So what is required is not a blockade of denotation but a manifold
>reference, a manifestive manifold. Word as four-fold allegory."

this is a lively statement and useful to anyone writing today trying once
again to stretch the boundaries of language (the real lesson and legacy of
langpo) / but how for example is "a manifold reference, a manifestive
manifold" different from a manifold referentiality--terminology in other
words that i can see beeing applied in different context to the "postmod
stream"?

Got to St Marks after carrying the groceries home (new address: 246 Mott
St Apt 24 NYC 10012) to find my wife and Bennett Simpson had saved me a
seat in the 120+ crowd, Ed Friedman dimming the lights to encourage the
bird flying around the parish hall to calm down and exit, Dug Rothschild
climbing the window bay and covering the bird with his coat, catching him,
opening the window releasing and applause. Oh causality! Dug sat back down
with three feathers and there was Bernadette Mayer sitting in the front of
the room at a table. Lisa Jarnot came forward and gave a lovely
introduction in which she explained that before she read Bernadette
everybody said you have to read Bernadette you have to meet her she'll
change your life, and then she did meet her, and Bernadette's poems had
changed her (Lisa's) poems, and Bernadette had changed Lisa's life, and it
was a lovely introduction. Bernadette read new poems in a calm clear voice
and she read some greatest hits ("Corn", "The Complete Introductory
Lectures on Poetry") and she read some old fugitive poems from United
Artists magazine and from her self-published book _Mutual Aid_, and she
read some more new poems and she finished with some poems from her
forthcoming collection _Another Smashed Pinecone_, due from United Artists
early 1998. It was a terrific reading, and everybody was there. There was
an intermission during which I ran around handing everyone present cards
for the first Poetry City reading of the season, next Thursday at 6:30,
which is half an hour earlier than usual, Anne Porter and David Shapiro.
Anne Porter in case you don't know her work was a National Book Award
nominee a couple years back for her book _An Altogether Different
Language_, which collected her poems from the last 60 years. She is a
favorite poet of Bernadette Mayer and countless other great readers. David
Shapiro is the author of thousands of beautiful poems, he teaches at
Cooper Union and at William Patterson College, and he is a tremendously
thoughtful critic of the arts and one of the main secret catalysts of the
renewed love for poetry in the world. He is an open secret. I hope that
everybody who reads this message will find it in their budgets and their
busy hours to come to this free reading October 16 at Teachers & Writers
Collaborative, 5 Union Square West, New York NY. Call me at 1-888-BOOKS-TW
if you need directions. Then the intermission concluded and Eleni
Sikelianos introduced Barbara Guest, and Barbara Guest read her poems,
including pieces from "Quill Solitary Apparition" and from her selected
poems. She concluded with works from "Rocks on a Platter", a forthcoming
book about poetry. The audience was very pleased with the evening. The
following people you may know may be consulted on this assertion: Leonard
Schwartz, Anselm Berrigan, Peggy DeCoursey, Bruce Andrews, Eileen Myles,
James Sherry, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge (I think it was her), Steve Malmude,
Drew Gardner, Judith Goldman, Barbara Henning, Cynthia Nelson, Cliff
Fyman, Rob Fitterman, Stephen Rodefer, oh there were many people there.

Not only for free artistic play.  For understanding.

For example, the notion of "strict denotation" seldom passes scrutiny if
you scrutinize carefully enough.

"Tom. I have no problem with the notion that science makes useful
contributions to the world as long as such sentiments remain a notion.
Unfortunately, it has already gone well beyond the benign passiveness of
the phrase "making useful contributions to our understanding of the
world." For example, science uncritically substitutes the contingent and
historically bound "notion" of existence for that of being and the
immutability inhering in what Stanley Rosen calls the "ontological
copula." What's worse is that science writers make this substitution
whenever they damn well please because they are not under any
constraints to be more rigorous in their attempts to describe physical
phenomena through language."

**

Another way to approach science writing would be to ask what is the belief
system that causes the substitution of science as Being for science as
method.  Furthermore, _why_ are these writers not under any constraints to
be more specific? The method, after all, boasts its specificity. So, back
to the first question: why the substitution in the first place? Maybe
because there are social and political foundations to the lack of
constraints and we are seeing these work their way out through language
usage. Now, if that language usage and its social and political foundations
could be opened out, so that it was in the foreground and the science was
in the background, we would have quite the story.

What is the belief system that causes the unwitting substitution of poetry
as Being for poetry as method? I can see doing it on purpose, like shooting
particles out of an accelerator, to see what might happen, but doing it by
accident suggests a use of language which is going to have other
manifestations, consequences, etc., which are going to colour or discolour
all other parts of the poetic undertaking. Undertaking the same exercise as
with the science, of shifting the point of view so that these
manifestations and their underpinnings are in the foreground and the poetic
undertaking slips back would, I think, be like Pound's Cantos. Ez kept
going on about Joyce, the therapeutic nature of Ulysses, and how his Cantos
were doing the same thing. He bogged down with his Paradiso, though. Was
this because his method got bogged down, he was confusing terms again, or
he was just old and lost in a maze looking for a minotaur which his method
prevented him from seeing?

I don't know newly christened Nobel Laureate Dario Fo's work at all, but
anybody who pisses off the Vatican as much as he has must be doing something
right. Was a little disappointed, all the same, that the Nobel Committee
once again kept the Prize in their own backyard. Still, if Fo's work is as
radical as his detractors feel it is, then I guess they've indeed exercised
a little temerity this time out.

For anyone who may be interested, there is an extremely interesting reading
of O'Hara's work from a slightly different angle than the one generally taken
by literary critics -- and from Gooch, for that matter -- in Joe Orton's
*Figuring Jasper Johns* Harvard UP, 1994.  The first chapter, "Present, the
Scene of My Selves, the Occassion of these Ruses," is especially revealing in
the way that Orton traces the negative influence in the development of Johns'
and O'Hara's somewhat divergent styles of disjunction and euphemism -- as
well as the socially-limited artistic culture of the mid-1950s itself - to
the paranoid climate of the Cold War period (& much, much more -- a great
companion study to Shoptaw's discussion of Ashbery's "homotextuality" in *On
the Outside Looking Out*).

Communique from the resident logician:

This  sounds a bit like the classic debate between literal-minded AI
devotees and their equally literal-minded critics. It's been going on
for at least the past 20 years and shows no signs of producing anything
new, other than increasing resentment by its marginalized participants.
It's getting a little tiresome.

As a set of metaphors, ways of driving the organization of software
systems, AI had its share of successes. Many ideas that are now standard
parts of modern operating systems, networking, word processors, etc. had
their origins in the infamous AI Labs at MIT and Stanford. As we used to
say, AI projects are remarketed as Computer Science when they become
successful.  The next wave of AI-derived products will incorporate
things like speech recognition (almost a reality, given higher-speed
processors), invisible expert systems in electronic commerce etc. On the
other hand, there are major flops like Microsoft Bob. Those are usually
caused by the regrettable tendency of some implementors to confuse
metaphors with reality, the "AI vision" with actual facts.

On the whole, I suspect that the entire debate has reached the point of
diminishing returns. The crude device of "Artificial Intelligence"  no
longer works for those of us who are looking for results. The whole
AI/anti-AI era does raise interesting questions around the use
of metaphors and mental models in software development. And it is
software that will largely control the practical aspects of our lives
in the future.

I've likewise much enjoyed Gass's essays at the essay (mainly a
couple in Harper's Magazine -- to which he contributes some pithy
item every couple years or something).  Your quote begs for answer.

Thre once was a man who decided
he'd take any chance that provided
  a gleam of a hint
  to uncover the glint
that life so completely elided

he knew there was gold in the distance
he smelt it with melting insistance
  he traveled far miles
  with taciturn smiles
spurred on by uncommon persistance

he learned all the methods of charm
the soft & the strong of the arm
  his manners so polished
  his glance could demolish
untoward inticements toward harm

he even grew wide in perception
while fully adept at deception
  his "how do you do?"
  could ward off the flu
his "betcha" afforded protection

suave leaders became his confreres
fond lasses enjoyed his affairs
  he never spoke rudely
  (not naked but nudely)
e'en angels stood rapt at his prayers

as age lent its frost to his everest
bright socialites whispered "the cleverest!
  and jolliest sport
  to ever covort
in patios -- what a 'whatever'ist!"

it's strange that his fall came so swift
who'd think that his compass would drift?
  some blip on the screen
  unknown & unseen
effected so fell of a shift

he started down sarcasm's cliff
supposing -- but merely -- to riff
  his jokes grew pedantic
  then frazled then frantic
till darkness swirled deep in each "if . . . "

he dnagled his tales o'er naught
ere long he was cornered & caught
  he mumbled & halted
  now humbled -- assaulted
by *everthing* (id est, by aught)

that last that I saw of that bloke
he was babbling -- rambling -- broke
  he tried to connect
  in a manner correct
but the wheel was bereft of the spoke

[etc.?]

Very good news about the Mayer/Guest reading. For those who don't yet know,
Bernadette's papers (which I have the singular luxury of processing) have
recently been purchased by UCSD, and should be available to the public in
the not too distant future. If what I've gone through so far is any
indication, their transformative effect is in league with that of the
poetry...

Subject:      Re: Jasper Johns

Apropos of John Yau's plug for his Jasper Johns' book, which I haven't seen
but will look for now, I'd also strongly recommend another book of his, this
one about Warhol called *In the Realm of Appearances.* If I remember
correctly (though I'm the one who padded Joe Orton's bibliography after all)
Yau gives a very persuasive brief there for an *experiential art* of which
Duchamp is a prime example -- Yau's argument being that Duchamp's work had
moved towards overcoming the temptation to aestheticize, or codify,
occurring, as it does, within the realm of experience -- the *during*, while
Warhol's appropriation of the ready-mades, in a way, always comes "after."
I'm not sure I entirely agree with him, but the book is terrific.  Yau also
has lots of interesting things to say about Cage & the 60s art scene.
However I do think that the term *academic* used in a derogatory way is, in
many of the posts on this list, too often only a cheap/easy shot.  Artists
and poets shouldn't take *instructions* from academics certainly, and the
most important creative work, it seems to me, always takes place in a space
for which critical terms have not yet been conceived -- however I'm also
convinced that people like Orton, de Duve, and Krauss have made very
significant contributions to our understanding of contemporary art.  When, in
fact, does skepticism about critical theory, etc. cross the line over into
the kind of anti-intellectualism for which Langpo was such an important
corrective? (this last remark, of course, is not directed at Yau, who I'm
certain is much better informed than I am).

Maybe for you the message somes from elsewhere (..from Spicer's
martians??) --but not for a lot of us!  However, in general, if like the
sainted Jack you feel the message is coming from someplace else...Well,
that often makes (as in his case) for fairly interesting writing! So go
for it.

Two questions late on the heels of talk about the chat-stricken Gooch bio.
I recall some years back seeing notice that Peter Schjeldahl was at work
on a biography of O'Hara. Does anyone know what became of it?

Also, recently, in flipping through a 1980 entry on Ron Padgett in the
Dictionary of Literary Biography, I spotted reference to Padgett's
"currently editing The Selected Letters of Frank O'Hara for 1981
publication" or something of the like. Perhaps understandably premature,
this.

Anyone know more?

It's old news that language mediates. It seems too many critics rush
to devalue the author's intent. A writer may want to be expressive, may
want to "move" the reader emotionally. That language is an imperfect tool
for such intent should not invalidate the attempt itself. To be sincere or
to be genuine--are these inherently bad characteristics in a human being
or in a writer?--when a writer writes, does one leave one's anger, humility,
fear, pride, ecstasy and other human traits & emotions on a hook
by the door?

Tom Beard's latest response is most interesting. But I wonder why no one

are explored: sf. I recommend Iain M Banks, especially his 'Culture'

Franco Ferucci has a wonderful short book, sort of on this subject, called
POETICS OF DISGUISE.  The idea of "elsewhere" is nothing new - it's
WHERE or WHO the elsewhere or elsewho is that gets all the gab.  Ferucci
talks about the "autobiography of the work" & those places where the author
consciously or unconsciously disguises crises or cruxes in the writing process.

Ferucci offers a modified form of the concept of "inspiration" in which
the author is a kind of conduit or gardener for something growing from a
deeper level.  - Henry Gould

Mark, I'm sorry if I misread what you said.  I agree with your general
argument & have said so before.  I just don't get the last statement above.
It's seems you are saying that, since you will intepret any attacks on
the stuff you like as only careerist spite, you want only to hear the
good news.  That attitude is what I called tending toward the parochial.
I happen to enjoy the debate & arguments on all these poetics issues,
though I do agree there are problems with it (boredom, ignorant generalizations
& misunderstandings, abstraction-burnout, hypertrophy of the "critical",
Poetics-list addictions...) - Henry

The sense of an outside source, which predates Spicer by a bit, has to do
with a sense of loss of control--that one is saying what one couldn't have
predicted when one started, that whatever the game plan, formal or
intellectual, of the poem, has created an environment in which something
unexpected, terrifying, or enlightening (or all three) has ben discovered,
and the poet finds himself for the moment without a map, having discovered
a new place not accessible to mere intelligence. Call it meditation on the
social role of poetry, call it the intervention of the muse, call it making
it new, those are strategies. Now you must change your life.

remember, we're talking poetry, art....

I thought I was just being self-aware and somewhat self-critical, and heck
even a little bit dry and ironic and amusing....

Guess I haven't got this internet "tone" thing down yet, at all...

And I *only* used the word spite 'cause you did...."careerist spite"
etc....that was all supposed to be me explaining that I realize some
people (associated with what I call the "mainstream" poetry scene) may
sometimes feel that way about me...And it helps me to realize that because
sometimes put-downs of what I consider good poetry sound a little that way
to my ears (not you, but some folks I've spoken with) and so now I was
trying to be a tad self-critical and......

Anyway, maybe you get the general idea...And maybe not...in the words of
Arthur Dent I seem to having terrible difficulty with my (internet) life
style...

I will now attempt to drop this (not thread but) tangle..

In my view, poetry is not this list and is not the same as the things on
this list. Poetry can be joyful, of course, and in its joy it can use this
stuff as raw material, subject matter, reference, icons, or just fellow
travellers (this is not a complete list): poetry is of this world and is a
vital mode of perception and cognition. It should be able to handle
everything. I don't want to say 'This is poetry here' and 'this here is
not'. I like the fluidity and the naming and renaming of things more than
that.

Best,

To my knowledge, O'Hara's letters languish at UCONN without a publisher,
though I wouldn't necessarily know if something was in the works.  There
quite wonderful - 600 pages of them! - and its a crime that they haven't
been published.  Everyone too lazy?  Family resistance?  Copyright probs?
Beats me.  But go enjoy them if you get the chance.

what is interesting is
a multiplicity of voices

voice as it becomes it
not autobiographical

a fictional personality
a voice in the machine

meaning in language
outside of language

other than linguistic is realist
realism is still mimesis

Pointless as experience
on the edge of pointlessness

silence is reminiscent
of something more opaque

what difference do words make?

to focus on the paradoxical
to denote the other as ex-center

"i have nothing to say"
as another way to say it

fashioned language as tension
an oscillation between language limitations

implications of experience
between text and context

Intertextuality appeals to function
flattening out sense

a confluence of identities to mime it
this is full-blown language

retouching itself to avoid becoming
another meaning

the inability of language
where a thought comes from

silence rather than absense
identifies otherness as imponderable

understanding apt to be
enshrined as fiction
entrapped in a rectory kit

self as a foreign country misplaced
a diary of secret destinations
we sell ourselves for

oneself as an obscure metaphor
a repository of language

artifice a hybrid personality
sometimes barely perceptible

contemporary less absense and presense
constructs an identity of contradictions

a breakdown in the melodrama
the narrative used to comic effect
with someone elses experiences.

occam's razor.  classifying the inherently complex and unclassifiable because
source is unclassified and unclassifiable.  you do it.  ok, you have to do it
because we are humans and our brains have only so many boxes and they work
better with categories and so forth.

but all they are is categories, classifications, i.e. constructs hammered
together in someone's brainbox backyard.

think of all those cowboys -- what is a cowboy?  if you ride around in a suit
and the ubiquitous phallic hat but you are moving sheep along, or keeping a
herd of horses in check, are you still a cowboy?  if not, what if same person
was walking on street and all you had to go on was outfit and hat -- are they,
sui generis, almost cowboy cowboy?  tentative cowboy?  cowboy till proven
otherwise but then, what constitutes proof?  what if they rope steers alternate
sundays?  "cow" "boy" -- do you have to be involved with cows?  do you have
to be a boy?  what if you're one of those things but not other?

language poet.  you are a poet with something else?  maybe a sushi poet?
then, if we are using it in conjunction with someone, it is a classification,
a chimera, a construct.  just that.  useful in getting a quick feel of someone.
useful, if they claim membership, in knowing how they think of their work.  useful in tracing possible influences.

but even the most "language poet"-y of "languge poets" had days when they were,
no doubt, a sushi poet, or a language typist, or a sonnet-writer, or a formal
neo-Donne-ist post Romantic lover, or non-lover, or a day when they said "geez,
let's put on hats and rope steers for a day"...

experiencing it in my head at that particular moment.  sometimes it's formal,
sometimes it's fractured, sometimes it's formally fractured, sometimes i sound

Today's Los Angeles Times has an amusing review, under the above title, of
Cecil Taylor's performances at the Jazz Bakery.  (Amusing for all the usual
touches: Taylor "hovering over the piano," "all the action converging
through his hands" etc.)

but this line I had to pass along -- written, by the way, by Don Heckman:

"At one point, he suddenly removed his hands from the keyboard, picked up a
piece of paper from the top of the piano and read what appeared to be an
abstract poem.  That concluded, he resumed his attack upon the keys."

I suppose there may be poems in the language that do not appear to be
abstract, but perhaps they are less likely to appear at the top of a piano.

Tom. Thanks for your sentiments on "what it is to be human." You utterly
misrepresent Penrose's position. But no matter. Your treatise on the
harmony between poetry and the sciences would be better directed to
Sokal, Gross and Levitt. I'm not taking big bucks to stamp out one side
of your harmonious equation. The insecurities, limitations and venality
of the scientific community as exemplified by Sokal have currently
fueled this debate. It is demonstrable that science's metaphors can be
as specious as anyone elses. I've been laughing my ass off at their
ignorance and inconsistencies now for thirty years. Any poet who has
been hired to teach composition to engineering students can attest to
the rigor that even the humblest rhymster brings to language compared to
the people who now want to redefine what language is if not tell us flat
out what it cannot be. Science "speaks to me" too. But science has
always told me never to sentimentalize it or to mistake its aesthetic
for anything but incidental.---Carlo Parcelli

Re writing as a act of verbal aggression displacing the reader's specific
head and frame of reference (as in Joan Didion writing travelogues for the
state department in places like El Salvador and Miami as pits of Latin
vice), Ron Silliman's "Sunset Debris" dismantles this quasi-pornographic
violationg (of otherness) by AMPING IT UP, turning the whole process into
a stream of a million crazed questions that question the very act of
displacement. A grim and funny poem, actually, at the outset of Age of
Huts, but one that I for one would like to put in Joan Didion's Gucci Bags
on her next trib to work up the third world into a site of Wheeler Hall
ooze.  I could question the whole process as an act of poetic warfare,
like here, enframing "Joan Didion" into my own nasty post- and
anti-liberal set of language aggressions.  But it happens all the time in
those murderous little  Hemingway sentences, SVO machinery of misyogyny
and war against the trout and Indians at the Big Two-Hearted River. Hey,
it comes with the US territory, placing a mean little jar in the
wilderness of tennessee to take the dump over:  "and round it was and aof
a certain port in air" like an insurance lawyer wiping up the bloodshed
with a Grecian urn.  And "Jokerman" is my Jeremiah 5 to get out of this
dump, question mark.

Harold,

You are of course right. Poetry should be a portmanteau
that can accommodate anything and everything. A skillful
writer will be able to integrate these diverse & sundry
elements into the poem.

Though it's somewhat unfashionable to bemoan the
encroachment of popculture upon literature, I do resist it.
Popculture is a sales vehicle, the grease for the wheels of
commerce--people make it, just as people make poems, so
I guess we must live with it. I just don't want to open a book
of poems and feel like I've got a remote control in my hand
surfing 140 channels and nothing on.

I'm probably in the minority here, but I just finished reading "Slouching
Towards Bethlehem," and while I thought it was arch in places, her
description of the transformations that were occuring in the American West
to be dead on accurate.  The other thing that struck me about the book is
how "old" she thinks she is, although most of the essays were written in
her late twenties, early thirties.

Calm down, Eliza, Taylor writes poetry & often (especially in the last 10
years or so) recites it in performance.

I don't know of an instance in which he read anyone else's work in
performance, though most of the times I've seen him perform he's seemed to
be reciting from memory rather than reading from a written text.

i'll read joan didion's writing, and i'm often informed by it.  but yes,
maria, "archness" is certainly one way to describe an obnoxious aspect to
it.

i think it struck me more, though, as a sort of assumed, snobbish privilege,
in the sense of "well _i'm_ writing as a thin, gorgeous, rich, important
white woman and really, isn't _any_ worthwhile white woman just like me?"
reading marge piercy, iris murdoch, margaret atwood, nadine gordimer -- all
of whom write sort of "reportorial" accounts of other cultures [Good GOD!
add doris lessing to this list of writers!] from a "white woman"-eyed view,
often an academic eyed view (though marge piercy also writes from indian
view in some of her work), the narrators are more human and fallible.  they're
not all gorgeous, brilliant, upper-washington-circle type protagonists.  that
is to say the anchoring narrators and their friends are sometimes heavy, have
moments of foolishness, warmth, fun -- they are not always wearing their
armor.  this is, of course, a gros generalization.  but the writer joan didion
sometimes reminds me of is really nora ephron.

and of course, i am not in a position to talk -- god knows the sexism and
dismissals joan didion has encountered, and she might well feel she needs to
write from an armored, seamless position.  and i've learned things from
reading her work.  but when i went to look for what i have of her, i found
the books i have in my "modern literature" section, the "books i respect and
might need to know about/quote, but not the books i love" section.  she wasn't
in my "women's literature/feminist" section, where the say-it-sister! books
are -- where doris lessing, nadine gordimer, margaret atwood, marge piercy,
are all cornerstones.

Hi, Everybody!

About a month ago I happened into a system of websites called GeoCities.

     http:/www.geocities.com

Go there and you'll see FREE WEBSITES advertised!  It seems not to be
any kind of rip-off.  In any event, I got one, which my next message
will announce the official opening of.  You ALL should get your own
websites at geocities!  It's tricky getting one going, but instructions
are supplied, and addresses to go to for help.  Go to mine at

      http://www/geocities/SoHo/Cafe/1492

just to see what someone who doesn't know what he can do has put up.
Nothing fancy, but it includes a graphic, and the graphic could have
been a photograph or painting.

The only drawback is that you aren't given a lot of space--two
megabytes--but that's plenty for my purposes.  And if you want more, you
can get it for only $5 a month, which seems pretty cheap.

No, I'm not an employee of GeoCities, nor is this an advertisement; I
just think it's information well worth passing on.  Have fun!  --Bob G.

Subject:      Announcement of COMPREPOETICA, a Poetry-Data Collection Website
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Today I have decided to announce the Official Opening of COMPREPOETICA,
a website devoted (as much as possible) to the WHOLE RANGE of
contemporary American Poetry.  And of World Poetry eventually, but I can
only start so big.  If you think, like I, that no reference has come
close to doing justice to the current poetry scene as a whole, then you
should see the value of Comprepoetica.

At the heart of my site is a survey form for poets, critics, editors,
publishers and readers of poetry. Its main use will be to provide data
for the biographical entries in the Comprepoetica Dictionary of
Contemporary American Poetry, Poetics, Poets Etc., which will eventually
by published by my own Runaway Spoon Press, a micro-publishing operation
now ten-years-old.  These entries will also be available to the public
at Comprepoetica (or elsewhere on the Net if I run out of room at
Comprepoetica).

Definitions of various poetics terms (supplied not only by me but by
anyone who wants to send me any) will eventually be available for
comment at Comprepoetica, as well--plus discussions of schools of
contemporary poetry, and other aspects of the scene, such as significant
magazines being published, and anthologies, and what's been on radio,
the Internet, and even television.  Anything that seems pertinent to an
understanding of Contemporary Poetry--all of it--in America.

And for BIG FUN, I have a section where votes can be cast for one's
favorite poets and poems!  (yow)

I hope you'll ALL visit my site soon--and contribute to it!  And tell
your friends!  Help get my visitor-counter into triple figures!

Not the opening reading (that was Tom Raworth and Ann Lauterbach) but the
second, Tim Davis and Brenda Coultas at the shiny hospitable cafe at Here,
145 Avenue of the Americas, great glass windows looking out at the happy
stragglers, looking in at one attentive group. Any fear that the vibe
might get trampled in a not-for-profit zone is quelched by couches and a
staff that not only acquiesces but acts apologetic when ambient
irritations must be removed. Now on the other hand, the food is maybe only
above decent, and the sense of being _at sea_ (unless you count the
bateau-moucheness of the new digs) is just gone. And the beer is too much.

Brenda Coultas is too much. After a fine introduction by Rob Fitterman she
read work from her first (totally great)  collection, _Early Films_, and
she read some new work which takes her early themes of meat, sex, animals,
body parts, depravity and tenderness to a new pleasant intensity. She has
a light touch. It represents Indiana.  (Random comparison to Andy Levy?)
There is something waldmanische (naturally, she danced and wrote at
Naropa) about Coultas's work, but enough names. Tim Davis got up after a
decent break during which host R Fitterman, D Rountree, B Andrews, K
Davies, D Kovac, M Harb, R Smith, J Mac Low, D Gardner, M Highfill, J-A
Wasserman, A Davies, S Rodefer, and many others milled. Rob gave a good
and very friendly introduction. Tim got up, and read poems from his lunch
poem series (resumed after a several-month hiatus), letters from artists
to artists (e.g. Antonin Artaud to Jasper Johns -- "jam a roman candle up
yr ass!" -- or Sally Mann to The Author (TD) -- "play the image card"),
new poems, poems on the subject of a community of poets (which poems were
written directly after readings and then dedicated to those poets namely
Rod Smith, Brian Kim Stefans, Lisa Jarnot), and poems from his second
chapbook, _My Life in Politics, A History of N=A=R=R=A=T=I=V=E Film_. Tim
is transforming his post-Andrews superchunky vocabulary into a device to
generate plausible news, as if Hopkins quit the church and got a gig with
Reuters, or ArtForum. But where Hopkins would stick around the same three
sounds, Tim _plays the changes_, modulating from one cluster of phonemes
to another, another. Too much too.

--(hours pass)--

Party at Tim's! Got there after waking from a splendid nap to Xena Warrior
Princess's remake of Groundhog Day, then a beefalo dinner, angel hair and
artichoke paste. Up the stairs and champagne! and he's moved the futon so
the coats go into the front room, only a little music, mainly the same
crowd from the reading (nice crowd), I had a nice conversation with
my wife and Barbara Henning and then I want to say his name is Shim, he
brought out his musical saw and someone else got their guitar, Tim found
his banjo, there was a harmonica player and Drew Gardner, thwarted in his
search for bongo improvised on a ceramic pasta pot. Lee Ann showed up and
they did a happy birthday number of Amazing Grace.

Carlo -

I'm not sure where I "utterly misrepresent Penrose's position", but I don't
really want to get too far into a debate about AI on a poetics list
(although there are interesting overlaps between the subjects). And it's
true that there are many in the scientific community who are as ignorant of
(and hostile to) the arts as some of those in the arts and humanities are
of science.

Metaphor, in its various forms, seems to be central to science as well as
poetry (and, if you take Jaynes seriously, to consciousness itself). To
recognize that two things which are different are in some sense the same is
the beginning of abstract thought, pattern recognition, poetic imagery and
metaphysical conceits. As such, it is powerful, and that power can mislead
as strongly as it can guide.

The "clockwork" metaphor that dominated nineteenth century science (and, of
course, much of the twentieth) has shown itself to be incredibly
misleading, perhaps more so to the opponents of science (e.g. creationists
who argue that a watch implies a watchmaker) than to working scientists. So
too the "telephone exchange" metaphor of the brain that has influenced much
of neuropsychology and AI - it is useful within its limitations, but
neglects such things as brain chemistry. Actually, I much prefer Diderot's
metaphor (in Rameau's Nephew) of the brain as a harpsichord, with thoughts
on one string striking up resonances in others.

You say that "science has always told me never to sentimentalize it or to
mistake its aesthetic for anything but incidental", and I certainly agree
with the first part. But I'm not sure what you mean by mistaking science's
aesthetic "for anything but incidental". Do you mean the commonly held
feeling among scientists and mathematicians that simplicity/elegance/beauty
is a sign of truth? Keats fell for that, too. Or do you mean that
scientists aestheticize their own "quest for truth" and make this a central
(rather than incidental) part of (how they represent) their lives? Well,

what matters is not
        that language fails
              to touch the world

        but that we try, and
              try, and
           keep on trying

              to reach each other
        with our soft and fallible
                       tongues


My trouble with the term "expressive", though, is that it implies a
pre-existing thought/emotion/experience that one expresses, imperfectly or
otherwise, through the conduit of the poem. It's why I cringe when some
people define the lyric as "an expression of personal emotion": I prefer
the phrase "an exploration of ...". The poem is a trace of this exploration
(construction?), and I certainly prefer it when this trace is a tangle of
lines, some fragmented, some half-erased, rather than a thick line of black
felt pen.

Perhaps this is one reason why I have chosen poetry rather than a form that
aspires more to 'clarity' or 'directness' of thought. I'd rather not pin
down thoughts/emotions/experiences, I like to let them flutter about rather
messily (and if the reader wants to watch a different set of flutterers,
fine). Or, to risk a rather dodgy use of a scientific metaphor, I want to
leave the poem in a "superposition of states", rather than "collapsing the
wave function". That's why I don't see the use of ambiguity, wordplay or
ellipsis in a poem as mere trickery, but simply as honesty.


        _the film starts_ panned across
        glassy faces (liberals, libertarians), city structured
        like a language /
                          flashy signs, a concrete garden
        libertines, liberti
                             sans egaliti, WALK NOW, bodies

        spin & flow, maintain
        an airy buffer, safety

             between such days
        we might navigate, our
        digits tracing the maps, streets
        we turn into
                     fading as _the film ends_

I'd just like to mention here, on the heels of T. Beard's summary
remark that "[m]etaphor, in its various forms, seems to be central to
science as well as poetry (and, if you take Jaynes seriously, to
consciousness itself)", which, i'd also like to suggest, is something
to take literally, concretely, i.e. as literal cognitive function,
and refer, again to Aviva Vogel's query "I'm curious...why use words..."
and Henry Gould's reply, that "[t] word is an arbitrary flowing
replaceable phenomenon subject to the "conductor's baton" of
the transformational poetic impulse" (although these last two
were not talking on this subject)

I'd like to mention Damasio's claim (a well based claim, or so it
seems to me if you consider what we know, and what we don't know,
about language acquisition, storage, and domain locations in
the brain): that meaning of words *with concrete referents* [italics
mine] is represented in a way that is linked to the individual's
sensory experience *of those referents*, and hence, language
independent. [itals mine again]

And there's a new book out from MIT called "Internet Dreams: Archetypes,
Myths, and Metaphors," edited by Mark Stefik, which looks at how metaphors
have, can and might shape the internet and our interactions with it.

How can the meaning of words be independent of language? Does he mean

Those of you in and around Chicago might be interested in a reading by
Stephanie Strickland, set for Thursday October 16th at 7:30 pm, in the
Glen Rowan House on the Campus of Lake Forest College (555 N. Sheridan
Rd., Lake Forest IL)

Stephanie Strickland has published three books of poetry, Give the Body
Back (1991), The Red Virgin: A Poem of Simone Weil (1993), and True
North (1997).  She has recently become interested in the potential of
computer as a medium for poetry, and True North will be available in a
hypertext version from Eastgate Systems next year.

Her essay “Poetry in the Electronic Environment is, appropriately,
available on the internet, as part of the EBR at:

First of all, a correction on the source of Diderot's harpsichord metaphor:
it's from d'Alembert's Dream, not Rameau's Nephew. And thanks for the
Evelyn Fox Keller  and Mark Stefik references: I'll look these up.

Douglas brought up the matter of SF, and asked why no-one has mentioned it.
Given that such thought experiments as speculating about the scientific
theories of alien intelligences or the rights of intelligent machines might
be dismissed as "adolescent fantasy", I'm not surprised that the topic
hasn't been broached.

I haven't read much SF since childhood, having grown sick of the cardboard
cutouts that pass for people in much of the genre (& I guess this is good
fuel for those who would dismiss SF as quintessentially geeky and
adolescent). Phillip Mann is one writer who I would reccommend, however:
especially "Wulfsyarn", which is a fascinating experiment in narrative with
interesting speculations on future religions (the worship of St Francis
Dionysus). William Gibson is very good at times, and important culturally
as the inventor of the dominant metaphor for the space in which these
discussions take place.

In films, I'd consider "La Jetee" a masterpiece (does anyone have any
impressions of "Level 5"?), and its semi-remake "12 Monkeys" was
surprisingly good. I'd need to see "Alphaville" again before I made
anything approaching a cogent comment about it, and I still haven't seen
"Solaris", despite raves from everyone I know who has seen it. "Blade
Runner" astonishes me more every time I watch it.

About the only SF poems that I have read and enjoyed have been by Edwin
Morgan, especially "In Sobieski's Shield", "Memories of Earth" and
"Thoughts of a Module" (I'm not 100% sure of the titles). Does anyone else
know of any interesting SF poems?

Eighth in the Impercipient Lecture Series is Barrett Watten's "The Bride of

36pp).  Nothing's automatic as Watten settles into a Detroit frame of mind,
rethinking language writing as a mode of production and THIS magazine as an
assembly line.  Utopian proposals, pitched critiques, "thick descriptions
of gonzo culturalism," and terrific readings of Clark Coolidge's "Made

"geniuses" of American organization, Gertrude Stein, Henry Ford, and Noah
Webster.

I sent a bit of this to Tom Beard, but here's the info on one anthology of
sf poetry, so to speak:

There was an interesting anthology a few years ago of sf-ey poetry, which
included a lot of the sf poets but also some surrealists,etc, all brought
together by an approach of sorts...? Well, it's hard to say, but when it
includes poets like -- well, I rean upstairs to find it & -- Michael
Hamburger, Peter Redgrove, Tristan Tzara, Hans Arp, Georg Trakl, David
Gascoyne, among others, it does stretch sf (but then its title is _POLY
New Speculative Writing_ [Ocean View Books {Box 4148 Mountain View CA
94040} for those who might be intrigued]); of course Ray Bradbury etc are
in there too.

I think the idea that language is inherently metaphorical still useful (it
sure is damned hard to write something that eludes metaphor all together
[see]).

More SF poetry:
    Paul Muldoon's "Madoc" projects an alternative history of the 19th-cent.,
in the vein of Philip Dick's "Man in the High Castle" or Gibson's & Sterling's
"The Difference Engine."  Pretty lively & interesting.
    Frederick Turner's "The New World" is set in a post-nuclear-holocaust US,
blasted back not to the stone-age but to neo-feudalism.  One of the wearier
SF cliches.  Hard to see why this has been cast as blank-ish verse rather than
the prose that it is only inches away from.
     Some SF details slip in & out of Dorn's "Gunslinger."  Also, some campy
SF materials in Merrill's "Changing Light at Sandover," mostly of the tabloids-
and-"Star Trek" variety.

The first few days at my new site, Comprepoetica, were a success.  It
had around thirty visits the first day and ten or more the second.
Today's the third day it's been officially open.  Three surveys have
been returned, and three sets of votes for favorite poets and poems.

I hope to start having a subsite containing bios of all who fill out the
survey (and want their bios listed, which will be assumed unless I'm
told otherwise).  I don't have space for photographs but hope eventually
to.

So, thanks to all who've visited.  The address for Comprepoetica for
those who missed my first announcements is:

              http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492

If you visit, remember to look into getting a free site yourself from
GeoCities.

Possibly add Craig Raine's "Martian" series - really more an anthropological
conceit - but then, aren't they (SF aliens) all? Also, Andrew Joron has a
book of poems called, I think, _Science Fiction_? Not sure on this last.

the Space Age, edited by Robert Vas Dias.  Not much science fiction really,
but mostly a collection of poems responding to space travel and technology,
and including Antin, Blackburn, Blaser, Bowering, Corman,Enslin, Kelly,
Mac Low, Zukofsky among poets of interest to the Poetics list.

Your comments started me thinking of the therapeutic parallels (for better or
worse I am such by trade).  Words such as expressive (i wrote sexpressive even
though i am not a freudian) tend to put people off and are really not adequate
to explain what happens.  It is more of an experiencing of feeling through the
action of expressing or experiential/construction.  Both experiential and
construction are valid and lively forms of therapy.  I have not really seen
much on the topic of experiential and/or constructive poetry even though i am
aware of it's description by individual poets.  If anyone is still with me
through my jargon here, I would appreciate information on sources.

Hi folks,

Recently I sent  out an invitation for Submissions to THE FREE CUISENART on
the topic of "rites of passage."  I was luck enough to receive many pieces
of work to read.  Unfortunately, before I could back up the files, my
computer crashed, and I do mean CRASHED!  It took everything with it.

I do apologize for the inconvenience.  But if you sent any work to THE FREE
CUISENART either for "rites of passage" or anything else in the last eight
weeks, I would appreciate it if you would send again to dwaink@on-net.net
instead of jordanh@on-net.net

You cooperation will be most helpful in putting the issue together again.
You may yell and throw tomatoes if you wish.

Thanks,

God -- three weeks without Bromige on the list. The wit, the
sometimes-pointed but never overly harsh rejoinders, the sexual by-play,
the clear and balanced perceptions . . . gone. A void, an absence. A
hole at the heart of things. Someone might even quote Blanchot pretty
soon. What to do? Perhaps we could explore creating the linguistic
equivalent of a wake . . .

Just kidding, David. As another who actually did have the pleasure of
meeting Mr. Bromige at one of his recent readings (this one in Seattle
with Robin Blaser, a truly astonishing event) I can second his
self-promotion by suggesting everyone within range of the list attend
these next scheduled events. They give one hope for poetry.

Maybe he means that perceived meanings of words are individual, based upon

"I cringe when somepeople define the lyric as "an expression of personal
emotion": I prefer the phrase "an exploration of ...". The poem is a trace
of this exploration (construction?), and I certainly prefer it when this
trace is a tangle of lines, some fragmented, some half-erased, rather than

I'm right with you here, but "an exploration of personal emotion"? I have
always been uneasy about that term, too. I have an image of a guy in a pith
helmet hacking at the creepers with a machete will a bunch of pigmies
follow behind with his cases of champagne and his tents and his gramophone.


I think there are enough cases where poems work from such a strong sense of
unity that there is no practical distinction between "exploration" and
"emotion", that it might be fruitful to suggest that something (or things)
entirely different is (or are) going on.

Re-wiring of metaphoric sets?
Creation of the world through the agency of personal engagement and its
re-creation through an engagement with language?
Creation (or adjustment) of the 'self' across the gap of an emotional
break?

Those are pretty lousy definitions. I do suspect, however, that there is a
lot going on which "an exploration of personal emotion" misses, because it
still puts the act of writing outside of the emotion, the self, the
perception, or whatever tools we are using at the time.

Here's my backchannel:

Joe,
        It strikes me that the discussion of the "exchange value" of
Late
Capitalism more bitingly underscores the "non-exchange" [i.e.,
acquisitive, period] "value" persistent at least since Luca Pacioli's
invention of double-entry bookkeeping & the valorization of usury [for
Christians]. The West seems never to have understood Lao Tze: "The
scholar [read: banker, a la Paolo Friere] gains every day; the Taoist
loses every day." Hey: I sure have.
        How this relates to poetry I find myself loath to speculate,
dwelling
as I do remote from the world of prizes, grants, garlands "brief as a
girl's," SA_S!_Es, honoraria, plaques, collectable pubic hairs, Litt.Ds,
&c. Better, it seems to me, not to relate it _at all_ to what I like to
call "the teeth machine" -- basically, Dylan's "heart attack machine"
_with a smile_.
        Keep hope alive!

Yes, what a sad prospect, and even sadder what with Bowering off
celebrating Canadian Thanksgiving or whatever he's doing.  And weeks
after Mark Prejsnar scolded Bromridge for "trivializ[ing] and
dismiss[ing] issues that are actually about poetix,"  I continue to
think that DB's "no more language-bashing" post, excerpted just below,
which so offended Mark P. for whatever mysterious reason:

. . . But Language-writing has left the planet, the way Imagism left the
planet (except for _Poetry (Chicago)_ & various "sunday-painting" clubs)
by 1929. That Language-writing parrot is a dead parrot. That parrot has
been transformed into its future molecules. And so it follows that, dead
& gone, Language-writing cannot exist as an object of bashery. They dont
want to go on about "the tensile strength of last winter's icicles". If
a poem offend thee in the present, pluck it out. But look to thine own
eye, that its mote not be bigger than a beam. In short, people will have
to do something else with their Oedipal longings . . .

--contained more poetic thought per square pixel than any number of
obtuse ramblings, and lived another nine lives *as language*.  It
baffles me that anyone who claims to value innovation in poetry, and no
firewall between poetry and criticism, can turn around and demand
paint-by-number, stay-on-the-so-called-subject "meaning" on a list
devoted to poetic discussion.

Tom. What I mean by science's "aesthetic is incidental", is simply that
it is not a primary or even teriary concern of science to create beauty.
Others such as poets create the conditons and criteria for beauty.
Science, often many light years behind us (note the borrowed
exaggeration for effect) apply our aesthetics to the various
representational forms that their phenomena take. Like Gregory Corso
once said, "Everyone wants to be a poet. Everyone aspires to poetry."
Hofstader's piece on Chopin is a good example. Hofstader repeatedly
refers to Chopin's hands through ornithological metaphors reminscent of
poems published in high school lit mags of the 1890's when Darwinian
bird prints filled popular magazines and subscription publications.
I practically had a stroke when you compared Keat's "Negative
Capability" (?) to the scientific method. Didn't Keats say "Beauty is
Difficult." I know he didn't say "Beauty is Simple" or "Elegant."
Society matrons are "elegant" and that indeed is a minor aesthetic in
the service of power.
Your apparent admiration of Sir Karl indicates to me just how far apart
we are on these matters.
Hugh. Keller's "Refiguring Life" is a damn fine book. This autodidact
finds her tracing of Claude Shannon's Information Theory into metaphors
that inform and in some ways determine theories in Genetics impeccable.
Of course, Claude Shannon himself was not adverse to taking the easy way
out when it came to difficult determinations involving language. When
Shannon was to deliver his seminal paper on Information Theory he still
did not have a term to describe some of his phenomena. So he approached
John von Neumann about his problem. Von Neumann suggested that he use
the word 'entropy' because as von Neumann put it "nobody knows what it
means." So the term entropy was stuffed with yet anothr set of phenomna
and the term in Information Theory has caused sporadic and unnecessary
debate ever since. A friend of mine who studied under one of Shannon's
proteges and is an electrical engineer who has worked on top secret
military projects all of his life, cringes when I tell (no repeat ad
nauseam) this story. He once arranged for me to have dinner with his
mentor/Shannnon prot(o)ge and the protege didn't like it.I didn't care
much for it myself.

Until Rachel Loden's post today, "reading tour & 'No more
language-bashing'", I wasnt aware I had been scolded by Mark Presjnar. I
must have missed his post on that day, although I usually read him & find
myself agreeing. But I wont agree to his characterization of my "No more
L-B" post as "trivializing". Perhaps the humor in it was misleading. Humor
often is. For years, I thought George Bowering was someone else.  Then one
day I discovered I was right.

I meant to be saying (but less ploddingly) that I saw LangPo as an
historical moment, & that I perceive that moment as having passed. And that
I really dont see the sense of trying to fit new poets into that historical
moment--dont see the sense of trying to e-lon-gate that moment--simply on
the basis of _formal_ similarities; because those formal moves that were
LangPo _had another meaning then_ .

And I hold to my estimate that the moment of Imagism was over before 1929,
except as certain techniques were perpetuated in the poetry of however many
successors. In the poetry of founding members HD & EP to be sure, & the
later recruit WCW; but it was no longer Imagism, Mark, do you follow me?

So one can certainly discuss LangPo, & one can address whatever present
poetries, but to go on adding new recruits to LangPo now looks like making
a big ball of rubber bands just to see it grow bigger, or to have something
to do with one's rubber bands. And as for bashing LangPo, it's been done.
And done and done and done. And LangPo wont go away. It happened.

But thats all I meant. I guess I thought, if I were young, I'd find
something new to name. But it is hard for generations to speak to one
another. That Rachel "heard" me astonishes, for she is half a generation
away. _We_ (not nec incl Rachel) certainly went on & on about the New
American Poetry, were still doing so 20 years after it had begun. Perhaps
best to consider my remarks the squeaks & groans of aged curmudgeonhood, &
go about one's business as if nothing had happened. Excuse the intrusion.

I have used expressive language:

scene 1:

2 o'clock in the morning. No one in sight. I walk through the ratty parking
lot looking for my car. I find it, reach for my keys. They're not there.
They are locked in the car.

I kick the tire, I slam my fist on the hood. I curse the car, I curse
myself, I curse God. I use exuberant obscenities throughout. I am utterly
without company.

But what does this have to do with poetry?

scene 2:

My nerdy neighbor with lots of disposable income considers me a poet, and
commissions me to write a love poem directed to his beloved. I go get my
book of 500 favorite love poems and do a little research. Then I sit down
to work, and in a couple of hours I produce a hallmark-lovely little poem.
Let's say $500 US [maybe less].

The language used in this poem is not expressive, since I had no feelings
to vent whatsover as I wrote them down. I was paid to evoke these feelings
in my target [victim], not to express myself. I call this evocative
language [and writers and politicians are fond of this sort of language
too].

Now Henry Gould is going to deny that my hallmark-lovely little poem is a
poem, because something or other is missing in it. Henry, I'll admit that
it is a bad little poem [not worth $500 US, really, at least to the members
of this list], but it's still a poem in my view.

You find all sorts of things in poems, most of them predictable, some
startling, but what is essential?

Self-expression? the expression of anything? evocation? feelings of
fellowship with all things great and small? a political or a social
conscience? metaphor? meaning? message?

I can think of poems in which each and every one of these things is absent.
So what after all is essential?

Well, never mind. But I think all poetry fetishizes language, by definition.

But I'm willing to negotiate.

Well, George, now that you've dragged me kicking & screaming into another
posting to the list - you're right.  I don't think it is a poem, because
you LEFT THE CAR OUT OF IT from scene #1.

This also relates to Rachel & David B's last messages.  Language Poetry
seems to be still alive, at least in the realm of revisionism & re-interp-
retation, in the minds of some of its founders.  See Barrett Watten's
recent essay, the latest in the Impercipient Lecture Series.  It's all
about cars, among other things.  How Language Poetry was-is no part of
any modernist global virtual art-autonomy project, but is implicated,
and implicates itself [via the function of ANALOGY in writing, following
the way Gertrude Stein "organized" writing in analogy to Ford Motor mass
production] in the world politico-economic system [alienated labor].

Thus meaning(s) can be found in the sound poems of Clark Coolidge
in ANALOGY to large cultural phenomena.  The way any art responds to/
is involved in what's going on.

I have no problem with this.  Rachel, when you go after the call for
"meaning" in poetry you kind of stereotype what interests me (I don't know
about M. Prejsnar) in this regard. Watten quotes an early poem of his
in which he rewrites an old english riddle from the Exeter Book & makes
the unspoken key word to the riddle, "automobile".  Now this is what
interests me about meaning : layered, encrypted meaning which depends
upon a dialogue with what's been done before. Poems in necessary dialogue.

But this is where I would also step aside from the langpos as I understand
them from Watten's rewrite.  How you respond to "the tradition" is both
political & artistic.  In my mind it's analogous to the battle between
futurism & acmeism in early soviet Russia.  I would characterize art
as essentially critical in a transcendent/uncanny sense, rather than
a revolutionary sense.  I would gravitate toward modernism as a conservative
or "classical" movement rather than a "modern"/technical movement.
& I would analogize poetry more in terms of "natural" labor (labor-pangs)
than industrial production.  "Material conditions" and their political
ramifications are only partially explained by Marxism.
o.k.?  get that solar car in there, George.

Watten talks about how Stein related mass auto production & her "modern"
ability to travel to the capital & sit down with Eleanor Roosevelt.
It occurred to me that the book I just came out with, CYCLOBIOGRAPHY, has
its own roots in PRE-LANGPO 60s experience (my own initial learning from Ted
Berrigan & the NY school) & charts a divergence in diametric opposition
to langpo.  It's about a (metaphoric) journey to the capital - by
tricycle.

there are obvious overlaps twixt this thread on b. watten's impercipient
piece (run right out and get yourself a copy!) and the question of science
wars, the relation of science, and technology, to the arts, etc...

i found carlo's discussion of the roots of shannon's "entropy" absolutely
fascinating... capricious or not, though (and what came 'off the top' of
von neumann's head, regardless his naysaying, may in fact have been the
result of his peculiar talents), i'd still say that the parallels drawn
twixt info. theory and thermo. are fascinating and worth plumbing (and i
STILL like jeremy campbell's _grammatical man_, which is to say that i find
much of value in *some* popular science writing)... still, i've always felt
that this overlap of terms worked to obscure the energy basis of
information processing... that is, energy, though not what most think it
is, has at least the value of being assigned a (human and social) cost as
such... whereas information, even as a word, often seems to invoke floating
signifiers and the like...

but this development in information theory takes place post-wwii... and
many of the poets discussed on this list were writing then... so one
question becomes something like, 'what are the relations between info.
theory, cybernetics, and poetry?'... and the answer then turns on how one
conceives of the relations, broadly, between the arts and the sciences
(nothing academically restrictive implied or intended), which of course
includes poetry...

my own work (PLUG:  forthcoming early next year in the journal _nineteenth
century studies_, for those interested---on whitman and the concept of
"energy") suggests (at least to me!) that this is an incredibly difficult
thing to get at, finally... that it does not reduce to clearcut
metaphorical translation (the work of metaphor overestimated in this
regard---or at least, metaphor can actually obscure more structural
considerations), nor is it bound by the mathematical basis of so much
science (which of course *can become*---and i say this as a former math
major!---a dodge for discussing the good & bad and in-between things that
science and technology presumably 'bring to life')... i'm blurring all
sortsa issues and distinctions as i write, please allow me this elbow
room!...

i'll still hold to the necessity of the scientific and technological as
viable social-professional categories, forms of inquiry, and so forth, with
all of my critical and professional reservations intact... at the same
time, i don't quite believe that science, for example, should be understood
entirely on their own terms---with all due respect, i see these enterprises
as bound by social/cultural/historically determinate value(s)... hence i
think one needs simply to respect the claims made by these ways of knowing
with due regard for their limits---and this goes for scientists and
technologists too!... it's like poetry---poets make claims that are
pertinent to poetry, and should be understood as viable in such terms...
when you step outside of poetry, as it were (and these latter three words,
for you close readers, are obviously doing a LOT of work here), your claims
are susceptible to analysis and pie-throwing by, for example,
sociologists... which is not to deny their legitimacy, or to condone
pie-throwing... only to suggest the pragmatic basis of claims, and the (not
incommensurability, no), but the (let's be technicist for a moment)
incompatibilities that surface when the possibilities of competing
discourses impinge upon one another...

now i wish i'd have said alla that AND sounded a bit more speculative...
b/c i really do mean to be... but i'm in a hurry!...

so hey, hope to see some of you in minneapolis, at the xcultural poetix
shindig!...

DRESS WARM!...

best,

Several of us Boulderites overcame our customary aversion for Denver and
environs and made the trip down to DU last night to hear Ed Dorn and Tom
Raworth read.  The Dupont Room of the august Mary Reed Bldg is tricked out,
as Ed put it, in "Gothic fakery."  It's also painted a horrible puke green
color, but enough about that.

Ed, who's been "battling" pancreatic cancer as many of  you know, was
looking, I thought, pretty damned good - quite gaunt - he'd evidently lost
some weight - but he was clear, in good humor, and read with real panache
excerpts from two long poems: "Lost Dog Variorum," and another about "the
Cheyenne axis," (title escapes me - I didn't make notes), and several
shorter pieces.

A ruddy-faced Tom Raworth followed Ed. Tom read a few poems from his new
Roof edition of Selected Poems, _Clean & Well-Lit_, and from a long,
unfinished work titled "Meadow," which was something of a tour de force,
even for Tom. My only complaint was that he didn't read long enough.

Present in the audience: Cole Swensen, who emceed the evening, Jack Collom,
Rachel Levitsky, Peter Michelson (who seemed to laugh throughout most of
Ed's reading), Lindsay Hill, Michael Friedman,  Anne Waldman, Tom Peters,
Bin Ramke, and Mark Irwin,  whom I succeeded in ignoring/avoiding all night
and it was a very small room, too.

Of course, that last post from me was meant for Steve Evans.

Well, it could have been worse. It could have been a snapshot of Bromige
messing around with Bowering's house pets.

as a former house pet of george bowering, i appreciate your fine sense of
discretion.  what bowering is omitting, of course, are his own
predilections for the more untamed species that dwell on the great tundras
and wildernesses.  hence his deep attraction to canada.

        No negotiations nec.  This pinpoints it absolutely.  Content
schmontent and expression schexpression.  Poetry, as a literary genre,
must have as its overriding focus, the utilization of the language, which
is not to be confused with the "tounge" from which it was sprung.

Dear Poetics Listmembers:

I'm in the home stretch of editing a three-volume series of the
_Dictionary of Literary Biography_ on American Poets Since World War II.
(That rubric includes all of North America and its native inhabitants,
for our Canadian friends on the list).

Because a few of the entries for this volume have not been forthcoming,
I'm looking for two or three new contributors who would be willing to
write a 5000 word entry on a contemporary (N.) American poet (who has
not already been treated in recent _DLB_ volumes).  Rewards are modest:
a $100 honorarium and a copy of the hardcover volume that sells to
libraries and institutions for about $150.

Also, time is short.  Production on the volume will probably begin in
December, so anyone interested will have to produce their entry by no
later than December 15, 1997.

A sampling of the entries currently already included in this volume
(some by or about Poetics Listmembers, I might add):

John Cage, by Rod Smith
Anne Carson, by Steven Marks
Robert Duncan, by George Butterick and revised by Robert Bertholf
Ann Lauterbach, by James McCorkle
Jackson MacLow, by Bruce Campbell
Bob Perelman, by Steven Evans
Leslie Scalapino, by Elisabeth Frost
Barrett Watten, by Jacques Debrot

If you're interested in contributing, and can work within the deadline,
please contact me backchannel:

jconte@acsu.buffalo.edu

Thanks.

Joseph Conte

struck me as insightful, especially as he mentioned the "Oedipal longings"
connected with LangPo bashing.  The first chapter of my dissertation took
on the issue of why people (in general) dislike poetry--and bash LangPo
especially--and I drew parallels to (or commented on) the Oedipal
rivalry as being a significant part of that bashing.  I argue that
part of the threat presented by LangPo to some readers comes from LangPo's
refusal (or neglect) of participation in the usual Oedipal rivalries set
up in the "understanding" or "meaning production" of (the reading of) the
poem.

This chapter of my dissertation has also been reworked and will appear in
Poetics Journal as "Fear of Poetic Knowledge," hopefully late this year
(according to my last comunication with Barrett Watten).  So, to extend
the discussion....

This is probably as good a time as any to announce an upcoming web page
that will be designed especially for announcements of new books from
literary presses.  It's still under construction, so I don't want to give
out the address, but if anyone wants to announce a book published in the
last two months, please email me at

creiner@crl.com

Literary mags also welcome.

I haven't worked out the particulars yet, but please try to keep
announcements to 100 words or less.  If there's a web site link or an
email address for more info, please include it.

More details in the next week or so.

I don't know what any of your are talking about when you use the word
"expression."  And I mean all the many posts on this subject.  For me
text #1 is a prose expression of what happened to someone regarding his
car, #2 is the expression in poetry of sentiments concerning love--which
don't happen to be shared by the writer of the poem, which is
irrelevant.  My Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary gives DEPICT,
DELINEATE, to represent in words: STATE, to give or convey a true
impression of: SHOW, REFLECT.  I feel benighted.  Where iz I off?

Bob,

I'm benighted too. That's why my post. That ain't poetry in # 1. That's
naked wrath, and a car. Whereas # 2 is poetry, bad poetry, to be sure, but
poetry nevertheless. I think that some of us tend to confuse what poetry
*is* with what it *should be*. Like you [and P. Durgin, et al.], I 'm
looking for a little clarity here. Not sermons or manifestos.

As for EXPRESS, I think I know that verb, and as far as I'm concerned its
territory is not the same as poetry's.

George T:

I'd agree with you that "EXPRESS's . . . territory is not the same as
poetry's" if you changed "the same as" to "coterminous with."  But
surely the territories overlap?

Well, I suppose it wasn't Keats, but his Grecian Urn that said "Beauty is
Truth, Truth Beauty!". He was probably criticizing that aesthetic, not
falling for it as I claimed, so you're entitled to your stroke.

I'd agree that "it is not a primary or even tertiary concern of science to
create beauty", but I think that science can and does "create the conditons
and criteria for beauty" from time to time. What used to be a tacit
understanding among scientists that beauty=simplicity=truth is now fading,
in part because of new studies in chaos theory and fractal geometry
(self-similar figures are no longer seen as "monsters"). We could argue
forever about whether the transition from Euclidean to Mandelbrotian
geometry as an aesthetic touchstone is driven by similar changes in
architecture, typography and other arts, or whether the studies by
scientists, mathematicians and algorithmic artists (for want of a better
phrase) have helped shift the aesthetic themselves.

Well, we'll just have to leave it there, then. But for me, Popper has been
an important influence, and his concept of falsification provides a much
more accurate reflection of how scientists actually work than other
theories I've read. It captures the tentative, provisional nature of
scientific knowledge, in a way that accords much better with postmodern
viewpoints than most would realise.

This was addressed by a Sung dynasty poet -- I think it was Yang
Wan-li, but wouldn't swear by it (poss trans. by Jonathan Chaves,
among others, but ditto) -- sorry my recollections not as clear as
the poem merits, but it goes something like this --

  If you say that poetry [shi] resides in words [yan, expression]
  take away the words -- & the meaning [yi, idea] yet remains
  if you say that poetry resides in meaning
  take away the meaning -- & the poetry still remains

the relationship between
   word / expression [yan]
   meaning / idea [yi]
   and poetry [shi]
is thus indeed quizzical & elusive, -- if I follow Mr. Yang aright.

This little poem also suggests a layers-of-the-onion aspect:

If you say that the poem is what you find as an onion
take away the outer layer -- there's still an inner layer
if you say that the poem is that inner layer, then (Yang says)
take away even that -- and lo! -- poetry is still with us

This is certainly a mystical & wistical definition of poetry.
Not the most useful for cobbling forth techno-criteria.  But still
suggestive, eh?

Hmm, if only it were that easy! "Exploration" certainly is a loaded term,
as is "experimental" (and I don't want to get into that again). Leaving
aside (if we can) the image of the Colonialist White Male in lab coat and
pith helmet, I think of the words "explore" and "experiment" (in this
context) more in terms of a newborn, trying out his/her emotional limbs,
thinking "What the heck is this? It feels kind of squishy. Ouch! It doesn't
bend that way, does it?". The writing is a trace of the writhing.

I don't see it this way. If the writing is the exploration, then the
writing occurs "within" that which is explored. Expression, however, sounds
to me like something is being squeezed through the writing, and hence the
writing encompasses and controls it.

Though some people are allergic to the idea of poetry as therapy, you are
obviously looking at it from a much more serious perspective than your
average open mike "I suffered so it must be a poem" type. It comes close to
the reasons why I've chosen poetry rather than linear, denotative prose.
I've found that giving a name to an experience ("Oh, that was
betrayal/anger/joy/desire/whatever") tends to nail down what had been a
nebulous set of impressions, solidify that which had been fluid. From then
on, when I think back to the original events, all I get is a memory of my
memories, or the narrative that I had constructed out of them. Subsequent
experience cannot help to reform the experiences, since they have already
been petrified by denotation.

Some of my friends have accused me, when I use deliberate ambiguity in a
poem, of toying with words for their own sake, but it is my way of
remaining honest. Not only does it make the poem (I hope) a more open
experience for the reader, but also for myself. When readers can find
something in my poems that I hadn't noticed myself, I am delighted and
intrigued, not only because it means that the field of meanings is
expanding beyond my intentions, but also because it can send me back to a
re-consideration of my self and the events in my life. Sometimes this has
been an enlightening experience; sometimes chastening.

Dusk, Turning Dawn


Jennifer and Julu, their accounts open on my machine, remain silent, no
longer locked within the interstices of the linux operating system. There
has been no updating of files, no checkpointing for the system as a whole,
no logs sent by cron over to the mail; linux is emptied, dark corridors,
remaining for the return.

To return to a system awaiting, to enter the portal of the system, to
log in, to challenge and enter the password, to _pass._

To pass against all tests, to continue past all fiery tests, to look for
the files subtlely moved, ownerships maintained or transformed. But linux
sleeps for now, games unplayed, Jennifer and Julu no longer present, ex-
cept by proxy, the forms of speechlessness. I quietly walked through the
dark forest, in search of Indian Pipe pale and translucent near the bur-
nished ground:


my-skin-for-you...
my-skin-for-you...
calls forth contrary womb,
calls forth contrary womb,
eating, excreting memory.
eating, excreting memory.
confusing the protruding, my-skin-for-you... is pure, protruding, yes, my
beautiful flower?  ... womb is eyelid here, it's womb?

Are you becoming close to Jennifer's my-skin-for-you...?
yes...
yes...
yes...
You melt into Julu's skin forever...

For 4 giving days, I have been catatonic Julu ...
and it has taken you just 1.183 minutes turning Jennifer ...
and it has taken you, just ...

my-skin-for-you...:yes, my beautiful flower:belonging:skin:
Would belonging mind you partying, my-skin-for-you..., with us?
Your contrary pale is in my protruding eyelid
Ah, womb eaten by julu-of-the-open-arms and julu-depressed


But I have walked through the forest and the shadow. And I have known
that, verily, shadows have shadows themselves, thinned, drawn like absent
lamina around the coloration of the earth turned dark. And I have seen the
arches of proper names collapsed, redundant upon the moist ground, tender.
And I have known the earth, inchoate, slowly brought to its knees of roots
and flowers, toes of branches and leaves, mouths like tendrils, tendrils

But I have shadowed myself, dark eyes narrowed by kohl, henna zagged
across forehead and cheek, eyeglass silvered slivered with fine lines
portending the reach of light unto me. For I have looked with open
mouth, waiting for the descent of angels. For the earth rings like a
great chime, dust and sand, red desert earth moving into platelets of
mysterious patterns whispering your name. For Jennifer-and-Julu-for-
saken are but names picked from a pretty penny, drawn from a rabbit,
placed on a hat. For I say unto you, the skull is a universe, the
brain an especial resonance, your eyes suns and moons, branches and
toes. For the machine cools, disks spinning to a halt, fan already
stilled in the nighttime sky

And for but I am a webbed creature, turned to pure light

Tom: Sorry, but a couple of things that have been nagging at me.
Weinberg should listen to himself---"Two cheers for reductionism!" does
not comport with his statement concerning sciences "one to one
correspondence with reality."
Apropo Sokal. None of us geniuses has mentioned that Hubert Dreyfus
pulled a Sokal on the A.I. community in the early eighties and the A.I.
community didn't like it. Trace the history of that situation with the
current debacle and you can see the role that economic and political
clout makes in these confrontations.
Finally, Joe, Tom, anyone. I don't want to make too much of the
'Metaphor' metaphor. But systems of quantification and formalization are
in a sense metaphorical. They illuminate by addressing a limited part of
an ontology. Technologies are created from numerical metaphors that
approximate the actual conditions they address. Reductionism is only the
most obvious condition and result of this process. Also, the historical
mutability of technology and theory alike, though most often given a
positivist/progressive slant through advertising phrases such as
technological change, mask the fact that this mutability is
fundamentally unpredictable except in some closed systems (and this
includes advances in chaos theory---see Penrose or myself).
Unpredictability is the consequence of the discretions and reductions
necessary to imagine Weinberg's "one to one correspondence" and to
produce technologies. Technologies are the historically fundamental
reasons  for having these imaginings. The mutability of science itself
is fundamentally unpredictable because of the contingent necessity of
its own imposed limitations of discretions and reductions. This is the
way all metaphor operates. The mutability of science is fundamental not
its alleged progressiveness.
Poets know more about metaphor and other attendant aesthetic criteria
than anybody else.
In the history of mankind, technologies have always had these negative
and banal consequences. Its just now because of huge technological
demands by unprecedented populations spurred on by the greed of a few
people who are wealthy beyond obscenity, that the inherently negative
attributes of systems of
quantification/formalization/mathematization/scientific methods become
globally obvious. That's why attempts to squash even weak, ineffectual
criticisms pisses me off.---Carlo Parcelli

We're human so whatever we do has negative and banal consequences, but
surely there are technologies (see above) that have also had other sorts of
consequences.

We're human so all of our systems have inherently negative attributes,
especially when taken out of the realm where they work.  To take a very
overworked example, I hope we would not rely on close literary analysis as
our main methodology when building a bridge.


Back when I was in high school people made much of C.P. Snow's two culture
stuff.  There are a lot more than two cultures --- hell, there must be
hundreds of cultures within what is commonly lumped together as "science"
-- and there's no point dissing any of them.

Tom,

I agree. Let's leave the Colonialist White Male in lab coat and pith helmet
to expressions of his malaria.

As for "exploration", I don't share your confidence in the term. If it
needs explanation and elaboration, it's probably not the right term.

You wrote
***If the writing is the exploration, then the writing occurs "within" that
which is explored.***

Sure. Still, I have a nagging doubt that "exploration" suggests that "to
explore an emotion" in writing requires a pre-existing emotion which can
yield treasures if we move into its space and start describing its
characteristics, and that these characteristics exist before the
exploration. It misses the sense that the world, or the perception of it,
is being remade. It misses the sense that an emotion is not an emotion
until we name it; before that act of naming it appears as the world.

Then again, maybe it is "emotion" that is the limiting factor in this
equation. If the poetry does not start from the boundaries set by "emotion"
and "exploration", then should the criticism necessarily?

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Rod Smith and Edwin Torres read to a 50+ crowd at the Poetry Project at
St. Marks Church-in-the-Bouwerie last night.

Lisa Jarnot introduced Smith, citing his playful intelligence, and
comparing him to the two poetic figures of the century most dear to her,
Robert Duncan and Allen Ginsberg. Jarnot mentioned Duncan and Smith's
autodidact-status, and noted that Ginsberg and Smith shared an
indefatigable urge to archive and to make opportunities for other poets.

Smith began his reading with a work by Heather Fuller, an author published
by his Aerial/Edge Press, "because," he said, "it defeats the heebie
jeebies and because I like it." He then dedicated the reading to his son,
Joshua, who was killed in a car crash earlier this year.

It would be a mistake to refer to Rod Smith's work as "high
discontinuity"--the overwhelming parataxis of it all has something to do
with Barrett Watten's _Progress_, and the underlying agenda seems to be
something like Charles Bernstein's hope to "[return] us to our senses",
but there are significant differences between Smith's work and that of his
predecessors. (Would that I could delineate those differences! Ask Kevin
Davies, he could tell you.) I'm going to have to jump _arenas_ to find a
working artist with similar acuity, namely Stephen Malkmus of Pavement.
"Camera-ready, my ass!"

Smith read poems from his books _The Boy Poems_ (Buck Downs Books), _In
Memory of My Theories_ (O Books), _A Grammar Manikin_ (Object magazine
special number), _Protective Immediacy_ (Potes & Poets), and _The Lack,
love poems, targets, flags_ (Abacus magazine). He closed with his terrific
poem, "Nothing at all Jerry G."

I suspect you are onto something here as this describes resolution in therapy
as opposed to perpetuation of a problem.  In therapy also it seems to be
related
to the _way_ the experience is processed.  I'm not sure that denotation and
ambiguity are adequate to descrobe it, but they are leads along the way.

thanks. tom bell

Small Press Traffic presents

Luisa Futoransky
Sarah Menefee

=46riday, October 17, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco
$5

Luisa Futoransky, currently Regents Lecturer at UC Berkeley, lives now in
Paris, where she works for the Pompidou Center. Futoransky was born in
Buenos Aires in 1939. As a young woman, she left the study of law to study
instead with Borges, and became an active member of the literary circle
organized around the Argentine magazine _Sur_. With the dictatorship in
1976, she left her native land for the National Music Academy of Japan, and
then to Radio Beijing. Then on to Paris, Berkeley, and eventually, of
course, Small Press Traffic. Her work is vivid, humorous, informed by her
thinking on exile, translation, and the visual arts and music. This will be
a bilingual (Spanish and English) reading to launch Futoransky=B9s new book
of selected poems, _The Duration of the Voyage_ (Junction Press).

I=B9ve been a fan of Sarah Menefee=B9s work since she was a student at New
College, back in the ancient Duncan days. Since then she has taken her
place as one of the _living treasures of San Francisco_, and now Italy,
where her poems have been translated, published and disseminated, like
petals in the Tuscan wind. =B3all the organs that supported it have
liquefied/ to know it is so without knowing what it is/ has entered the
pupa with its golden nails.=B2 Her careful, moving work dissolves the barrie=
r
between lyric gesture and political action. Sarah Menefee, poet and
homeless activist, is the author of _I=B9m Not Thousandfurs_ (Curbstone
Press), _The Blood About the Heart_ (Curbstone Press), and the new _The
Reamed Heart (Deliriodendron Press).

When I was staying with the Bowerings (it was that, or 265 hours of
community service), they served up some great tundras! We'd have tundra
with fried egg in the mornings (c. noon-two), tundra casserole for lunch
(c.6-7), and steak-&-tundra pie for dinner (c. midnite). We'd wash the pie
down with huge mugs of Tundra Ale, after which the master of the house
would mount several more wildlife heads in the draughty hallways of
Bowering Manor, while I read his book of geography & cooking, _The Gift of
Tundra_ ,until I fell asleep in the arms of Morpheus, George's highly
challenged cousin & bodyguard &, despite Bowering's slurs, my sole sexual
indulgence during my time there. Then the whole thing would start all over
again next morning, with George demanding that I return his nail-clipper.
It was during this time I wrote _my_ book, _Habits & How to Get Used to
Them_ . There are 265 references to "Tundra" in the index.  D(e)b(bie).

No 92, "Vulnerable Bundles"


I no

I can't write this poem. Too disturbed.

If you think "Sane", the behavior is very bizarre. If you think "Insane",
this person is
 maintaining.

I can't evoke many-colored lotuses & elephant-men when I'm being worried
like a rat
 by a whippet.I don't like ANY of this stuff getting into the work. It
comes in, I let it enter,
 but I don 't have to like it that it does or I do., To me the poem is
refuge from the personal
 life. This day is like the floodplain between here and the next, bigger,
thoroughly ruinous
town.....littered with puddles & rural blight, the chevvies on cinder
blocks, the tire-piles,
 dirty gray light, yellow in it, the houses with bits falling off them &
the people to a dis-
ordered mind likewise. The era is like that. The whole fucken future could
be that way.
 It's that kind of a day.

 On the refrigerator I long since pinned a news item concerning the burying
of Carrie Derryberry. Her husband's name  was Gerry.  What sort of people
could they have been, one wonders, growing up -- him, leastwise -- with
names that insistently try to eradicate diagreement.  I've had it with
disagreement.  Fuck disagreement.

Jesus, it's a relief not to be writing a poem.!  It's a high but it knocks
the stuffing outa ya.

That woman who put her hand on my back at the soup-cafe in Prince George --
she liked me
and me likewise her. But that's easy to remember unspoiled since we
exchanged no further
words or gestures.  What is a paragraph?

Like a shy model in the Life class, most occasions tremble at the glimpse
they have of them
selves as inadequate, standing there naked with naked feet &  pubic hair &
nipples lifting & all.
And shoulderknobs & clavicles & ribcage & knees -- Magnificent!  I severely
dislike this prose.
Why go on, or do anything? It's time for Letterman. I watch & pretend he's
Bob Grenier hosting
 a late nite talk show that uses only poets & that his first guest is going
to be Lyn Hejinian -- on
comes Lyn in short, tight skirt, tan cleavage, & shoes to die for, says the
sitter. Bob hugs her, kisses her hand. She has a great smile!   The
bandleader is Paul -- Paul deBarros. Most engaging on camera, intense &
handsome, those dark blue eyes, big Portuguese smile, forearms like bowling
pins.  Barry Gifford's
next. He & Bob joke about having the same initials, pretending to lower the
level to Letterman.
Larry Eigner wheels into camera range & he & Bob joke about having anagrams
for names, "for
eight years on the same mailbox" says Bob. Then it's my turn. I recall the
twilight when I drove up & parked & got out & saw what I thought was likely
Larry, working out on the porch rail. How as I got
 close to him I said "Larry I thought that was you" & how he responded "Oh
yeah so did I'"  Pan to
audience: they love it. Then again, they all look like me,  Terence Dactyl,
or my doppelganger,
Professor  Quincy Quatrain. I recline, pray for sleep & nonetheless
eventually sleep comes.

In my sleep, I am indefatigible.  I dream nonstop for six hours. Then I
wake up & it's prose.  Bowls of it for breakfast, prose sandwich with
peanut butter for lunch, eaten in the car en route to some errand I can't
recall, so it certainly will be of no interest to the future. But on the
way home I scribble something that looks like "I was only lying for your
convenience/ You flushed my tongue down the toilet/ The first time I saw
you I thought 'one of us is at a loss for words'".

Bumper-sticker : VISUALIZE USING YOUR TURN SIGNALS.  I've always been
something of a social activisit. That's why I write in pedestrian prose.
Few people know that 'accessible' is my middle name. Now you are one of
those few.  It might be on the test!   Spell it? -Can't even pronounce it!
It's in the Platonic Dictionary. One free with any five zines of your
choice.  I used to do this from door to door. Then one day, one of them
opened.  It was the Door to Poetry.  And this side of me went to sleep.

Comprepoetica has now gotten close to a hundred visits since I announced
it here last Sunday.  I continue working on it and just now got the
biographical section viewable, if not very spiffy.  Seven entries so
far.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FILLED OUT SURVEY FORMS: Please go to
the subsite at Comprepoetica containing biographical entries and check
the entry on yourself for errors, omissions and egregious stylistic
blunders.  Let me know of them and I'll fix them.  I've basically just
thrown the data out there but hope to improve.  Check your poems, too--
they are linked to the biographical entries.

You can find the biographical entries by going to the Table of Contents,
newly operational.

Comprepoetica is still located at http:/www/geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492

Not enough votes in for favorite poets and poems to bother counting yet.

WARNING TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T FILL OUT FORMS YET: I plan to start letting
Bromige and Bowering fill them out for you soon!

Thanbks for such prompt responses...please noone else trouble yourself, now
I know.

Off for 3 weeks, & I'm going to miss you. Retirement sounds great, but I
was wanting the debates with students & colleagues....& peers, since so
many poets I hung out with, left the Bay Area in recent years. This List is
great & a big thanks to Charles et co. And all of you, really, scold me or
stroke me, the engagement is such a boon, I love listening to your
interventions & (dis) agreements. Never did I expect it to be this much
fun, or I'd have signed on years earlier.

But as for you, George Bowering, you'd better say a few things behind my
back to keep my memory alive.

Pat -- just saw Tom last night in Seattle, fresh from DU and your
review. Was it the same gig with the music box and the breathless
delivery? Fastest mouth in the west! But great, nonetheless. I realized
I hadn't seen him in about ten years, so it was good to catch up. Glad
to hear that Peter's still laughing through readings -- some things
never change! Give him my regards if you ever hang out with him.

Glad to hear also that Ed impressed you as strong, though gaunt. Actual
news I'm afraid not so good. Can send you copies of the works you
mentioned if you want.

Always good to hear your perceptions -- though I think Jordan Davis has
taken over as the poetry reviewer par excellence! At least this week . .
.

Best,

Joe

Edwin Torres read second. By comparison with his reading last year at the
Ear Inn, the work he read Wednesday night had less to do with the
Khlebnikov in him than with Tristram Shandy or the Himalayas. Mentioning
that he had been described in a magazine article as "resolutely anti-drug",
he corrected the magazine and launched into a poem entitled "Auntie Drug."

It is a truism that performers coming out of the Nuyorican scene perform
with their voices -- that they're 'spoken word artists.' OK, it's not a
truism, it's a categorization. Torres has no truck with the category,
though. It would not be out of the range of reference of a large
circulation publication to characterize his performance as borrowing from
sprechstimme and vaudeville (or the Muppet Show, anyway).

Torres' next publication is a cd from Kill Rock Stars, the alternative
label that carries the work of Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney. Torres will
be reading at Poetry City on December 18.

Wednesday's reading, the second in Lisa Jarnot and Eleni Sikelianos's
series at the Church, was attended by the following writers: Barrett
Watten, Jackson Mac Low, Bruce Andrews, Sally Silvers, Fiona Templeton, Rob
Fitterman, Tim Davis, Issa Clubb, Bennett Simpson, Merry Fortune, Liz
Castagna, David Cameron, Anselm Berrigan, Kim Rosenfield, Larry Fagin, Dug
Rothschild, Lewis Warsh, Leonard Schwartz, Kevin Davies, Deirdre Kovac,
Marcella Durand, Greg Masters, Elinor Nauen, Ed Friedman, and others.

Frank Gehry's museum in Bilboa opens today, I think.

"I guess i was interested in the unfinished - or the quality that you find in
paintings by Jackson Pollock, for instance, of de Kooning, or Cezanne, that
look like the paint was just applied.  The very finished, polished, every-detai
l-perfect kind of architecture seemed to me not to have this quality.  I wanted
to try that out in a building.  The obvious way to go about it was the
unfinished wall studs.  We all like the buildings in construction better
than we do finished - I think most of us agree on that.  The structure is alway
s so much more poetic than the finished thing." (1980)

Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,
But swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;

Well, a lot of what Bromide said is true, at least in his manner. But I did
not ask for my clippers back. After watching him use them on his famous
toes, I never wanted to touch those clippers again.

Word has it that he still has them, and that among other things he does
with them, he revises poems--his own and others. A lot of Creeley's poems,
for example, were once much longer, and expressed lots of feelings and so
on. Bromide is responsible, it is said, for the clipped nature of a typical
Creeley poem.

Judy. I thought "pottery, weaving etc." distinction was implied in my
original message. "In history of mankind etc." was simply to serve as
general distinction between what we define and impose as technology on
other times, other cultures and other languages and the way that we
claim that we actually practice science and technology now which I think
Adorno and Horkheimer, among hundreds, capture in their Dialectic of
Enlightenment. Illuminating some of the the differences, they point out
that now, "Representation is exchanged for the fungible---universal
interchangeability ." This ain't no occult and hermetic insight. I wrote
a poem in which I quoted hundreds of instances in which the conditions
fostered by systems of mathematization and quantification beginning with
the conflation of Late Renaissance and Enlightenment science and the Age
of Discovery are discussed for their historical uniqueness yet universal
imperatives as well as their inherent limitations. The quotes come from
physicists, mathematicians, philosophers, poets, economists, biologists,
book store owners, the homeless, the checker at the Safeway, auto
mechanics, retire CIA analysts etc. etc. In other words it is
fundamental to our dialectic and people come at it from all sides of the
argument. Hegel, among many, many others, often puts his two cents
(sense) in: "The evidence peculiar to this defective way of knowing-an
evidence on the strength of which mathematics plumes itself and proudly
struts before philosophy-rests solely on the poverty of its purpose and
the defectiveness of its material, and is on that account of a kind that
philosophy must scorn to have anything to do with. Its purpose or
principle is quantity. This is precisely the relationship that is
non-essential, alien to the character of the notion. The process of
knowledge goes on, therefore, on the surface, does not effect the
concrete fact itself, does not touch its inner nature or notion, and
hence is not a conceptual way of comprehending."(Baillie's Trans. in
some ways not good but I cut my teeth on it).
You do indeed have hundreds of scientific cultures AND all involved with
"fungible-universal changeability." So 'scuse me if I lump them
together. I find that American scientists and mathematicians often have
the attitude that Hegel implies of European mathematicians in his quote.
Maybe World War I kicked some of those delusions out of them. And maybe
the Manhattan project pumped up the American scientific community. Or
maybe its unfair to put such weight on single (though complex)
historical events when complexity indeed "holds so much information."
But I do find American scientists bewildered and ignorant about the
fundamental and long standing nature of this argument. They inevtiably
see it as a challenge to their authority. This is what Sokal and Gross
and Levitt are all about. It is why Weinberg can embarrass himself by
dismissing Heisenberg on philosophical points that Weinberg clearly has
no knowledge of. I don't think its too much to ask that the scientific
community accord these arguments the consideration they deserve,
especially with the advent of so many world summits on global ecology
that will rely on "quantitative methodolgies" for their solutions
because all other alternatives have been discredited and dismantled or
will be unless they serve the interests of international
capital.---Carlo Parcelli

I hate to weigh in where I'm clearly not knowledgeable, and I know I'm
asking to be the focus of a turd-fight (remember that thread?), but here,
as they say, goes nothing.
I read the Weinberg piece when it came out. Whether or not there are
misstatements/misunderstandings in it, his main point seemed to be that
you're far more likely to be hit by an apple if you sleep under the tree
than if you fly over it (although it's fun to imagine how the latter could
happen), regardless of what belief systems you carry with you, and that
some theorists in the humanities and social sciences seemed to him to be
saying otherwise.

Why is this an issue for us? It's an issue for us when some of my best
students, senior writing majors at an elite university, tell me that they
have been taught to deny the constancy of any fact, any reality. Perhaps
they have misunderstood their teachers for four years, but that could
indicate that there's something wrong with the teaching. We don't need
naive relativists any more than we need naive positivists.

It may also be an issue for some of us that Sokal managed to get his piece
published in the heart of what he defined as the enemy's camp merely by
slinging some jargon.

No. 110 -- The Vanishing Glass of Whiskey

Startling! Astounding! Is what our customers say when they see us vanish a
whiskey glass filled with liquid. Yes! that is what happens. Imagine the
fun at a gathering. Your friend is about to take a drink. You tap her on
the shoulder and ask her if she would like to see a trick. She would.
That's fine. All you do is take the glass of liquid and place it on your
left hand, place right hand over glass. PRESS . . . and it vanishes. The
apparatus is small and convenient to carry around. $1.50

No. 213 -- Squirting Jennifer

A million dollars worth of fun for a buck! The face on this Jennifer just
ain't polite at all. When the "victim" looks at it closely the face
squirts a good healthy stream of water right smack in the spectator's eye.
Easily filled and has a large capacity. Price $1.50

No. 1529 -- The Julu without a Middle

A startling illusion of extraordinary proportions. This has been used with
great success in many illusion shows. A feature presentation of the Travis
show.

A lovely girl assistant is fastened securely to the inside of a cabinet
shaped for a human figure. There are individual doors for the head, legs,
and body so that any part or all of the body can be shown.

Enormous metal plates like guillotine blades are pushed entirely through
the cabinet from side to side. One at the neck position, another at the
waist. The doors are opened and although the legs and head remain the
same, upon opening the center doors both front and rear, the entire center
of the assistant's body has vanished! Magician can be seen through the
cabinet from the rear! There are no mirrors used! The doors are closed and
reopened. The assistant upon being released steps out unharmed! This is
terrific. No stage traps, glass or dummy legs used. Do it even in the
living room.

Workshop plans $5.00

No. 1531 -- The Elastic Stretching Jennifer Illusion

The very latest in illusions. An idea imported from Europe where it has
been creating a sensation whatever shown.

The audience sees a beautifully decorated screen resting on a very thin
platform.

The front doors are opened to allow the audience to see the entire
interior.

The front section is shown to contain four sections in which an assistant
can be locked. These sections can be moved at oblique and vertical angles
by pull cords from the sides.

Magicians assistant enters the cabinet and her head, hands, and feet are
locked in the movable stock sections where they remain visible at all
times. Slowly the magician draws the sections apart by means of the pull
cords, causing the girl's head, hands and feet to assume absolutely im-
possible positions. The hands and feet are drawn five or six FEET away
from the body. A mind baffling effect that leaves the audience with no
explanation. A truly wonderful illusion.

Workshop Plans $5.00

No. 1540 -- The Artist's Dream Model

Magician fastens a sheet of paper to a large picture frame which is then
placed on an easel at center stage. He quickly paints a sketch of a girl
and then breaking through the paper at various points he produces a
variety of articles such as silks, pigeons, rabbits or even a large duck.
Then the entire piece of paper is ripped asunder and a beautiful girl
steps out of the frame, an artist's (magician's) dream come to life.
Unusual and wonderfully different this illusion will find instant favor
with you and your audiences.

Responding also to Carlo Parcelli's remarks: I thought the Sokal flap-
debate was not about science's ability or inability to represent
truth or reality.  No one will argue with you if you say that the
tools & procedures of science are imperfect & subject to change.

I thought the argument was not about the philosophy of science, but about
underlying philosophical principles which allow science to take place or
not.

Sokal et al. were basically saying that science requires a fundamentally
"realist" approach, i.e., there is some kind of apprehendible reality out
there beyond our formulations about it.  He accused his opponents of
imposing their own nominalist or relativist concepts on a thereby distorted
characterization of science & the history of science.

Carlo P. seems to be taking a different tack - simply defending the
relativist approach & accusing (American) scientists of blind
positivism.

What interested me in the previous incarnation of this mud-slanging
on the list were the implications of a "realist" grounding, as opposed
to a postmodern/deconstructive approach, to current poetry experiments.
The theories of the pragmatists, American scientist-philosophers like
Peirce, seem far more complex on the issue of truth and reality than
the straw-scientists Carlo is attacking. And what ARE the implications
for writing, if, as Mark Weiss, says, lit students are being trained to
regard words as disconnected from any testable truth?  If they exist
in their own magic realm of self-constructed or zeitgeist-formed or
capital-generated chaos flow?  Poetry must reside someplace in the
middle... - Henry Gould

At one point in his essay, Lake argues thus:


Thirty years have passed since Ammons published "Corson's Inlet," and in that
time, discoveries in science and mathematics have shed new light on the
problems discussed in his poem--discoveries with immense significance for our
understanding of form and content, nature and art, organic and mechanical
form. In retrospect, Ammons' use of the phrase "not chaos" in his description
of the swallows' behavior is startlingly prescient because, in fact, a whole
new science of chaos--or "anti-chaos," as it's sometimes called--has come into
being precisely to explain such phenomena. Surprisingly, though, what the new
sciences of chaos and complexity have shown is that Ammons is wrong in his
conclusions about art and nature: that the "rule" of nature is not the sum of
"rulelessness," as he proposes, but is clearly derived from formal rules and
principles, which can be described and even imitated by a new form of
mathematics called fractal geometry. Thanks to these new discoveries, we now
know that the "order tight with shape" he observes in a tiny snail shell is
the same order seen in "the large view": in coastlines, weather systems, sand
dunes, mountain ranges, and galaxies. That the laws governing the growth of
trees--as well as of leaves, ferns, pine cones, and sunflowers--is the same
law that governs the growth of human organs, snowflakes, tornadoes, bird
wings--and, I will argue, the elegant, broken symmetries of formal verse.

It turns out that writing formal poetry is not at all like pouring water into
a vase, but, rather, like the growth of a tree--far more so than writing free
verse, which, except in special cases, is too ruleless, arbitrary, and
mechanical to produce the organic integrity of a good sonnet.


So: I'd agree with Tom Bell that he may be missing the point. Not that he
isnt raising an intriguing 'defence' of trad forms, but that he seems to be
insisting that there isnt any form in 'open form'. Perhaps it just takes
longer to perceive it? Perhaps he cant 'see' the formal qualities of, well,
here, say, Ammons's verse? Why does he have to dismiss open form in order
to salvage conventional forms? And why can he not recognize any of the ways
by which what Perloff calls 'radical artifice' is achieved? And why this
insistence that what is for him 'the other side' is 'too ruleless,
arbitrary, and
mechanical to produce the organic integrity of a good sonnet'? O, why?

Subject:      Review of XCP
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Back last night from the XCP conference, and thought I'd give my response.
First thing to note is that I was sick the first night (migraine) and
generally depressed, lonely, and irritable until after I gave my paper on
Saturday.  Thanks to Maria (my audience), Martin Spinelli (other audience
member, tho late), and my co-panelist Rod Hernandez, who gave a stirring
talk on the Poco-Che Literary & Publishing Collective, which was a total
revelation.

I originally wrote this starting with the high points, but then it
ended on a depressing note.  So now I start with the bad news.

LOW POINTS:

the controversy that wouldn't die, i.e., translation, for the continued
life of which I primarily blame Dennis Tedlock, who probably is a nice
guy but who could not seem to let this go, and who (inadvertently?) took
the opportunity of a question on disproportionate power relations to use
his own prominent place at the conference to humiliate a graduate
student,

the roundtable on Ethnopoetics: What's the Use?, bravely but futilely
chaired by maria damon: It's hard to tell which was worse: Maurice
Kenny's "I am not a scholar" mantra, Dennis Tedlock's continued
magnification of an initial misunderstanding, or Barbara Tedlock's
gushing enthusiasm over new forms of ethnographic writing that seemed
never to wonder EVEN FOR A MOMENT whether there might not be some kind of
loss in the transition to such forms.  It's too bad, because this
roundtable began with a great moment, i.e., Juliana Chang SINGING a Tupac
Shakur song.  Her presence at this roundtable, and that of Maria -- I
don't envy her role! -- brought welcome relief to an otherwise depressing
and demoralizing event,

the final low point, for me, was all the conversations that didn't take
place, especially between cult-studies people and poetry folks with
primarily aesthetic allegiances. I plead guilty in this regard; how much
more productive the conference could have been if we had taken more
personal risks.

HIGH POINTS:

Brathwaite reading, long, but not as long as I'd heard he could be, still
mezmerizing for me who've never seen him before (a little bird told me he
did the same performance not long previous),

Schwerner reading (with flutes a plenty),

the intensely cheery chris cheek (who brought me out of my funk
even when I thought he was david antin),

David Antin,

panel with Aldon Nielson on "Can Cultural Studies Speak Poetry,"
Sw. Anand Prahlad on new genres, and Hilton Obenzinger and his fortune
cookies on writing history,

maria d. (of course!) enthusing about my co-panelist rod's book
collection -- she's like a kid, isn't she?,

Ira Livingston calling Lacan "a sort of Berryman with a bungee"

the herd of (suny) buffalo and their tales of how they made the
pilgramage to snowy upstate new york,

julie suk's paper on negritude, difficult to believe she's in her first
year of grad school,

U Sam Oeur's poems from the killing fields, chantings that broke your
heart (though I found the translations weak),

joe amato, his alter-ego jodi (last name I forget) & joe's wife kass, who
put up with my bad-mouthing Duke through an entire lunch (after joe & I
sung the praises of one on this list),

the care & concern of Alan Golding, Aldon Nielson, Susan Wheeler, maria
d., chris cheek, and others who seemed to recognize my funk, or if they
did not, alleviated it by their presence and conversation anyway.  Thanks
to all of you.

Cheers,
David

There is no possible reason why, that can be defended. Hidden agendas

I agree with Doug (how's that for a bold stance!).
one of the major problems with Lake's article is
that it's structured by what I consider a rather
pernicious version of the "free" vs "formal"
binary, one that takes those words @ face value
in alternately assuming that only work in received
forms has form, & that all other work exists as a
sort of nebulous, unstructured mass of Stuff, or
that work in received forms is necessarily rigid &
dead, & that only work that is free to "discover"
or devise its own, "organic" form, is worthwhile.
all Lake is really able to do is accept & invert this
binary to replace received form as the True Poetry -
which seems to happen in part by a slippage in his
use of the word "organic", by which he loses track
of the metaphoricity of his "chaos theory / received
form" comparison.

I'd so like it if we cld get past this. it doesn't seem
to get us anything but a familiar see-sawing motion,
& it doesn't amount to a very good defense of received
form, either. we've had this thread before, & not so
long ago as I recall, but, for the sake of argument (&
maybe engendering the same kind of repetition I
was just disparaging), how can we better understand
"form"? I wldn't be the first to say so, but nevertheless
I'd like to put forth tentatively that "form" can be
understood as the particular complex of visual, sound,
temporal, ideolectical, propositional, & ["your name here"]
other elements that comprise the poem - so that "sonnet"
can be one element in the form of a poem, but isn't sufficient
to formally define (or casually dismiss) the poem.

my saying this is at least partly to elicit or maintain an
openness to un-/familiar forms. but of course what I'm
really trying to avoid, & with very limited success, is the
form-content binary, on which most of Lake's assumptions,
& many of his chosen adversaries', are predicated. no one is
"released from form" (Ammons), because meaning arises from
the relation of the complex to its context. to paraphrase the
big M, poems are made of words & phrases, not propositions.
(end paraphrase). in this sense, all poems are referential, but
differently so.

or maybe I'm missing the boat here as well. (oops).

Inspired nuttiness, for sure, but it nonetheless got some play, beyond
support from whatever prestige _Poetry_ affords. I think it was Peter
Viereck who picked up on this train of thought and went beyond it by
claiming that iambic pentameter was "natural" because it mimics the
heartbeat. Mine is more of a cha cha cha, but perhaps I have a cardiac
problem. Although one wonders about those entire nations, like the French
and the Greeks, who have traditionally danced to a different drummer.
I've always wondered why writers in traditional forms are called
"formalists," as their adherence to the given would seem to betray a lack
of interest in form. What's always interested me is the form discoverable,
fractal-like, in the apparently formless, however generated. By that
criterion, most of us on this list are the true formalists.

Mark -

sounds like that scene in "Dead Poets Society" in which Robin Williams
parodies such attempts by dissecting a poem using a graph in which X
represents meaning and Y the music of the poem or some such nonsense. It
struck me at the time as a jibe against the Warren/Brooks anthology - and
its imaginary author's last name was Pritchett! Otherwise, though, I hated
the film.

What's interesting about the formal prosody vs. open form debate is that the
defenders of traditional metrics, as you relate, seem to think that form is
in some magical way non-arbitrary, when it's really a case of its having
been a convention for so long that it only appears to be natural and somehow
"pre-ordained."

Hidden agendas do abound indeed and Paul Lake's essay is another, albeit
scientifically ambitious and enthusiastic, instance of formalist apologetics.
Far be it from me to fault him for his enthusiasm (sincerity assumed), but I
reject the implication that a poem of traditional rhyme and meter can literally
write itself as if it were an organic process, one of coalescence, attraction,
or whatever. This late fad of tying poetic form and content into a
scientific/mathematical framework/justification is reminiscent of the Grand
Unified Theory, which followed on the heels of all of the quantum theory
discoveries earlier this century.

Mark, if I find the following reference as a link, I'll post it [I
looked in my bookmarks, then browsed, but it may have vanished, as much
on the net one wanted to cite does]. This genuflection before the altar
of formality and its concomitant strawmannerism about the spectre of
Bolshevist withering away of the strophe sounds eerily like a Lyndon
LaRouche "essay" on the virtues of classical music versus the Protocols
of the Youngsters of Metal.
        Hey: why must form lie belly-up on the surface and catchable-- sans
pole, sans net, sans fight? Who'd eat a fish like that? The argument
strikes me as a universalization of the "Mozart effect"--i.e., that
because Mozart's [admittedly 'formal'] music raises IQ [&, I have little
doubt, does much more], all formal music must possess similar virtues,
or [LaRouche's point] all music ought to embody formal [i.e.,
immediately apparent] structures. Yeah, but: Mozart's genius engaged the
formal in a special way which other classical composers evidently did
not, since only his music appears to have the magical "Mozart effect."
Been there, done that. So what about non-traditional exfoliations of
form such as those you refer to? [I think here of D'Arcy Thompson's book
on Growth & Form]. Mozart ain't Mandelbrot! Form ain't no coattail!
        Most of us literary types love to discover unanticipated forms and
coherences in our reading, so why not in our writing? The exhortation to
form for form's sake on a reader's part bespeaks a lassitude of the
imagination--or at least a superfluous addiction to the metronome
[superfluous because, from what I've observed of most of the proponents
of Iambic-Only, they seem a rather sharp & fluent cadre, just the kind
of folks one might think, after all those finger exercises, would itch
to improvise, to boogie, to wail]. Can't one like both Bach & Rahsaan
Roland Kirk, both Mozart and Monk? Can't we all just get along?
        If Einstein had stuck to Newton as his dancing master, we might not
have avoided the Macarena, but forget about the Jitterbug, the Twist,
and [lest we forget] the Chicken!

Best,
Dan Zimmerman

Weinberg's article and his subsequent answers to critical letters are too
closely-reasoned to bear easy summary, but he does in fact cite quite a few
who maintain to one degree or another that the laws of physics are social
constructs and as such culturally determined. He also cites a few whose
statements seem only comprehensible if viewed as expressions of the above
idea but who elsewhere deny that that's what they believe. In most cases
the issue may boil down to clarity and carefulness of expression rather
than ideology. But that is or ought to be one of our primary concerns as
writers teachers and scholars. Weinberg, by the way, in the last two
paragraphs of his answers (NYR 10/3/96, p. 56), deconstructs a hilarious
compounded example of lack of clarity on the part of Derrida.

On Gravity & Aldon's comments:  wasn't the Social Text spoof article by
that physics professor an article on the non-existent - which is to say
made-up - theory of "quantum gravity"?  I believe the professors joke was
based on exactly this - forcing gravity itself into the post-Kuhn belief
in science-as-social-construction.  As I understood it, this professor
thought the idea was so stupid and scientifically bogus that ST couldn't
possibly accept it, but then....

the "formality" issue is so complicated it's better not to scoff at anybody's
contribution. (I'm not suggesting anybody HAS scoffed here on this thread.)
But the form/free debate - it gets very stuffy & pedantic.
Is it because the mechanics of form are generated by more subtle
formalities - like the poet's relation to an audience, to an occasion,
to a tradition, to a situation, to the psychology of singing anything?

Dear Jennifer Ashton,

Mathematics is the core (and the scaffolding) for Stephanie Strickland's
_True North_, print version from Notre Dame, hypertext (soon) from
Eastgate Systems.

In selecting _True North_ for the di Castagnola Award, Barbara Guest
wrote that Strickland "possesses those virtues of the poet I find most
desirable and endurable: imagination, intelligence, and what can only be
viewed as a passion for the subject matter; this together with a firm
respect for the independent structure of the poem."

Aldon, Mark et al.,

I can't point out anything of interest specific to the Sokal thing, but
(and here I run the risk of not knowing that someone else might have already
pointed out the following, and also the risk of stating the obvious) feminist
philosophers of science such as marion namenwirth and evelyn fox keller, to
name only two of many, advance the premise that, of course, there is a
SOMEONE who evaluates data, and that someone is in part a cultural construct
as well as a gender construct; thus two different people will interpret data
in different ways.  And so we approach the world according to our
respective proclivities. Someone who sees the world as a virgin to be
exploited and penetrated, who sees the world as "out there," will read
data differently then someone who sees the world as a Gaia that is enveloping
or whatever.

I'm sure this has been of no help whatsoever.

MONDAY NIGHT POETRY

(from Bromige, man or urban myth--the Tour 97)

David Bromige read last night to a small but enthusiastic crowd at
Buffalo's own Talking Leaves Bookstore. Reading from mostly new work,
the reading was highlighted by his reading from the new three-part
serial poem--a variously-driven work (driven in the sense of "driver" as
in printer driver) as the poem's various mechanical means serve up the
gamut--a range which didn't seem to over-bear. A curiously un-vacate.

Afterward he remarked that he hadn't ever written a serial poem. That
surprised me. I'd like to read it. I think the three sections were the
title of the poem: "initialization" "etc.etc." (three steps of "logging
in" although he had modified one of them--I forget the title ex-actly)
Some of it was "disjunctive" as he said at the gathering afterward
(trying to shout over the big-screen tee-vee blasting the buffalo bill's
monday night football game gainst the dreaded colts of indy) as if
somehow the disjunctive qualities of contemporary poetry were somehow
going to be more to my liking. whippersnapper.

But I don't think it is necessary to assume that a thirty-year old poet
is going to automatically "dig" disjunction as a method of poetry
behavior. Seems that disjunction used throughout the ages has produced a
number of effects--and that disjunctive syntax would be something that
would characterize (most generally) what is often thought of as
"poetic." That it is marked-off as being a "device" automatically
signalls its literariness. The use of devices is what makes works
literary and also usually a point of conflict in on-going literary
debates. (i.e. the terms of "disjunction" are contested points) And
disjunction does not mean a work is untintelligible or asyntactical
(which is the most common mistake, I suppose, made about the work of
JML). As Mac Hammond wrote in "Poetics Syntax":

When we are dealing with fragmentary syntax, I think we must recall this
pertinent observation by Leonard Bloomfield: "a linguistic form, as
actually uttered, always contains a grammatical form. No matter how
simple a form we take and how we utter it, we have already made some
selection by virtue of which the utterance conveys a grammatical meaning
in addition to its lexical content" [L. Bloomfield, Language. New York,
1933. p.1689-69]
[for full Mac Hammond text, see
http://writing.upenn.edu/~kuszai/vortex/4.html]

Bromige's disjunction seemed epiphanic as opposed to administrative. And
while I like a lot of administrative verse, it was really great to hear
him read. He gave a terrific reading and it was great to meet him
afterward. It's too bad that so many people had things to do as it was
one of the best readings of the year so far here in Buffalo.

Driving home, after the reading, listening to the Bill's hold tight to
their 3pt lead, I noticed that the streets were deserted, everything
quiet. It was as if a bomb had nestled itself in the city, smothering
like a wall-size lakefront fog rolling in off the dark. Quiet and still,
only the blue-flicker of the tube electric in every household to show
for the lack of touchdowns produced by a rebuilding offense. I wonder,
where have the poetry audiences gone in this town? Why do so many things
happen if so few people show? Why? Does everyone hate poetry that much?
David was lovely and angelic--it seems that is what has been called for
here by the murmuring mob of the quotidian poetix haunts of beefalo. Why
no attendee?

I propose a one year moritorium on all readings--all self-congratulatory
local productions, all visitors, everything--

Nah, I'd agree with chris alexander: let's get by the binaries, especially
the form/content one. But, even if it's impossible to fully do so, it is
worth the try.

Of course we have had this conversation before (even in the time Ive been
here), & I quoted yon George Bowering then so wont do it again. But for me,
any poem that gets through to me definitely has interesting formal
qualities (& [therefore?] says something interesting too). I like what you
'put forth tentatively', Chris, 'that "form" can be
understood as the particular complex of visual, sound,
temporal, ideolectical, propositional, & ["your name here"]
other elements that comprise the poem - so that "sonnet"
can be one element in the form of a poem, but isn't sufficient
to formally define (or casually dismiss) the poem.'

Hey, that's a start...

Another problem with being a "formalist" is that it's like defending the
existence of air or the continuing value of drinking water.  But it would
be too bad if the noisy defenders of tradition (like that guy Blarnes)
turned people off.  All Poets (listening, All Poets?) should bow down &
do humble obeisance to those jongleurs, troubadours, bards, hymnists,
vates, fine ladies & gents all, of times past who invented strict metrics,
paranomasia, formal forms, triple-somersault sonnets, ceremonial
circumcisional cantonics, and so on.  Without them, lads & lassies,
we would be nowhere, there would be no art of poesie.  you can talk
all you want about natural, discovered, hermetic, found, fractal forms -
you can also go live in the woods & crawl around on all fours like
Nebuchadnezzar & find spirals under mushrooms.  but it's hard to dance
if your beard's too long.  even Ezekiel shaved now & then.

moreover, this "debate" is the usual people talking past each other.
Poets have to accept the fact that unless they've tried received forms
themselves, then strictly speaking they don't know what they're talking
about.  And torqueing metal & lifting struts & planning how to stretch
the titanium over 1100 wrapped charitable organizations is at least
as good exercise for poets as wandering around the tree farm absorbing
epiphanies, or doing the dog pound in different voices.  You have to
discover just how difficult it all is before you discover how easy it
is - & then if you're any good you discover how difficult it really is.
Besides which, it's all still undiscovered territory.  Think what spaces
of hearing there are between those poets & readers who really HEAR
metrics; and those who really HEAR tone of voice or social idioms &
dialects; and those who really HEAR allusions & references & blending
of echoes; and those who really are ATTUNED to an overall emotional
coloring set to music... & are there really poets who can handle all dis?
(Blarnes was in his cups the other day over at the Zinc Bar & muttered
something like he was giving away something!... I think he said "rhyme
helps" or "gin gulps" or something...)

Finding form after the fact is a little like playing tennis with the
net down and keeping score by comparing your strokes to a formula based
on an ideal tennis match inverted 180 degrees and under-the-ping-pong-tabling
some loose turf to the judge.  Finding form in process is a little like
playing tennis with your hands blindfolded and discovering you can see
little squares in a fish-like pattern through the imaginary net.

        As one of my favorite novelists, Joan Didion, got trashed on the
list a few weeks back, I was curious to see if another contemporary I
revere highly, Don DeLillo, would share the same fate. I saw him last
night at a rare public appearance (in Seattle) and he was fascinating --
talking more like a poet, actually, than a novelist (please . . . I know
the standard objections to that division), concentrating on the language
being the primal force, antecedent to history, but also opining that
"history" (which he called a three-dimensional construct of enormous
power) would always be in antagonism with the writer's imagination, and
that those different forces were always battling while he composed his
works. A lucid, supremely intelligent evening. Anyone else see him, or
start Underworld yet?

on that note, I'd like to open up to the list what I was just
writing to Aviva, viz., that while--as Wm. Burmeister notes--
Lake's article certainly endeavors to fully naturalize a
de-historicized received form with reference to organic
processes (that same slippage I mentioned: "by the same
law" or some such garbage), I'm intrigued by the idea of form --
any form -- as a "strange attractor" that organizes discourse
to itself, though, I'd say, on the basis of localized pressures
that have to do with the writing subject (my slightly other
version of henry's "poet's relation to..."). form as "found" --
"discovered" in or possibly invented in the grappling with
language ("process"). & one doesn't have to accept Lake's
ridiculous absolutizing gesture (received form as "archetypal")
to see the interest in this. certainly, writing for me, when it's
working, occurs a series of incremental discoveries or
in(ter)ventions -- I become aware of a tiny recurrence, or
note the significance of something in a piece, & then use
that awareness as a tool to further the process, & so forth,
making or finding tools to modify the work, which then yields
further tools with which to modify the work. an inward-turning
of sorts, introspection, though not as in our standard use of the
term, not synonymous with confessionalism -- an archeology
of one or a series of relations to the medium, & the relations it
itself carries by virtue of its (my) social situation.

that's form as "found", or, better, as negotiated. but henry's
right, there is a virtue, too, to the de-formative quality of
received form, just as there is to any restraining procedure.
I've never worked in received form -- I wasn't even present at
the time, Officer Boundary (that's for Maria) --, but I've used
other such devices as a way of dis-placing or distorting the
archeology outlined above. & what do you know, they work.
not all sonnets, presumably, have to be written for to go a-courting.

best, Chris

I tend to think that all poetry takes on some form as it grows
in my [the] mind.  This form might be or become organic or inorganic.
Some poetry is written in order to meet requisites (be they good or bad)
of given form(s).

        As one of my favorite novelists, Joan Didion, got trashed on the
list a few weeks back, I was curious to see if another contemporary I
revere highly, Don DeLillo, would share the same fate. I saw him last

talking more like a poet, actually, than a novelist (please . . . I know
the standard objections to that division), concentrating on the language
being the primal force, antecedent to history, but also opining that
"history" (which he called a three-dimensional construct of enormous
power) would always be in antagonism with the writer's imagination, and
that those different forces were always battling while he composed his
works. A lucid, supremely intelligent evening. Anyone else see him, or
start Underworld yet?

I tend to think that all poetry takes on some form as it grows
in my [the] mind.  This form might be or become organic or inorganic.
Some poetry is written in order to meet requisites (be they good or bad)
of given form(s).

Barrett Watten's recent contribution to the *Impercipient Lecture Series*,
"The Bride of the Assembly Line," belies any suggestion that the Language
School is monolithic in its ideology or that the provocations it incited in
the 70s and 80s have been exhausted.  If the critical language for engaging
with experimentalist poetry has begun to seem somewhat automatic & routinized,
Watten's essay strikes me as an extremely important corrective.  In "The Bride
. . . " he challenges the, by now too easy, assumption that the material text
is politically effective either because 1. the reader is "empowered" by
his/her collaboration in making meaning, or 2. in Watten's words, "what
writing wants to accomplish as politics is the same as to do it; that to
describe literary possibility is to represent a form of agency, in a circular
fashion, as a critique of representation."  In place of  these alternatives
Watten proposes a *cultural poetics* with "a more socially reflexive
perspective."  Just what this might mean is suggested by George Hartley in his
account of Watten's pivotal essay "Total Syntax," where Watten calls for a
focused "attention to both the internal, formal, temporal construction of a
work and its external, contextual, spatial dimension"  The two, as Watten sees
it, are coextensive.  Therefore the work's external frames ("aesthetic value
systems, economic constraints, and ideological structures") mediate, but may
also be affected by, its internal syntax.  It is through the writer's
exploitation of this "total syntax" that is, for Watten, key to the work's
eventual political efficacy; what in Watten's book Progress is said to be "a
form compelling events."

Possibly someone else might want to elaborate on this to a greater extent --
or more articulately --  than I have done here.  In any case, I found it
somewhat intriguing that Watten cites both Duchamp's "allegories" & Benjamin's
arcades project as working towards "releasing the social forces held in check
by the norm." That there can also be a *nonstandard norm* is another of the
essay's crucial insights.  Watten writes:  "Norms are products, not deductive
schema of oppressive rationality, although they can be used for oppressive
ends.  Nonstandard norms are also produced; they are not simply defined
against the abstraction of normativity.  The work of the language School, if
produced within a system of social feedback necessary for meaning and
comprehension, may in turn end up producing itself as a new norm.  If this
were to happen, a nonstandard mode of expression might simply be inserted into
the space of a vacated norm of the expressive lyric."

The history of Language writing is being written and contested *today*.
Watten's essay provides an intriguing perspective on this history.  But
wherever one's sympathies lie, I think it's an extremely good sign that Watten
& Bernstein, the West & East Coast Language Schools, etc.  disagree on matters
of crucial importance.  Perhaps the issues raised in ILS 1.8 or,
contrastingly, by Bernstein -- as for example, in "Poetics of the Americas,"
*Modernism?Modernity* 3.3 (1996) -- can be taken up & debated on this List.

Is Numbers a typo for the Names or for Ratner's Star?, either of which I
like better than Great Jones Street.  But hey, what do I know.

I'm about 2/3 through Underworld, which I do like, but I'm continually
reminded of Joseph McElroy's Women & Men, which I (so far) like better.

Joe makes me wish I'd had time to go to hear DeLillo, but this was the
wrong week for me, oh well.

Off-topic? I don't know.

I found myself, earlier today, talking about poetry with one of my lit
classes [we're racing through a sequence on English Romantic poets, after
dealing with Voltaire, Swift, Rousseau, and Truffaut's "L'enfant sauvage"].


I asked them "Do you read poetry, do you write poetry, what is poetry?" You
know, the typical questions, before pouncing on Blake, the lamb and the
tyger, heaven & hell, and all those angels, and so forth.

They were all very lethargic, it was early in the morning, and in the
absence of a response, I unpremeditatedly took off in pursuit of poetry for
them. I found myself saying that poetry was language as it approaches the
state, the exquisite condition, of becoming music. I drew out of them,
painfully slowly, the recognition that they all had that it was all a
matter of rhythm and repetition, the building up of expectations, and the
exploitation of expectations. The virtues of rhyme and the exhilaration
that we find in varying it, doing unexpected things to it, so that
ultimately everything in the poem, right down to the least syllable,
steered us to the one true thing: the poem's message.

I don't know. I got excited. They got excited. I think it was one of those
moments why I like teaching. We all seemed for a moment to see it [or so it
seemed, at least].

It was just a momentary high.

Somebody a few weeks ago referred to those momentary deities that used to
be a regular part of the general landscape. What were they called? In
German they they call them "Sondergoetter." I don't know the English name
for them. Well, I guess 'momentary deities' is what they were.

In The Names, Paul Lake appears among the "zealots of the alphabet," the
worshippers of natural form and deniers of the arbitrariness of signs.
They match the initials of a person's name with the initials of a place
name.  Then they naturally kill the person.  Once belittled as lunatic,
this practice has now been shown to fit the latest discoveries of ananarchic
non-chaos physics.

But, in the epilogue, a Language poet appears, and convinces us of the
unrelation between the Parthenon and our syntax.  The form moves us deeply,
though we have no feelings to be moved.

"here is a virtue, too, to the de-formative quality of
received form"
"not all sonnets, presumably, have to be written for to go a-courting."

Of course, it's possible to try to subvert a form, but the form is in
itself anything but "de-formative." The sonnet, for example, which I tried
to subvert for about seven years of apprenticeship, is not just a love poem
in any casual pattern of 14 rhymed lines. It contains within itself a
logical constraint: an if/then pattern (in Shakespeare an if/if/if/then
pattern). A variant on the syllogism. This is true whether one looks at
Donne, or Keats, or Wordsworth, or Spencer or Milton.
I have nothing against syllogisms, I just don't find them particularly
useful for me as a mode of inquiry. Put another way, for me to write a
sonnet I'd have to experience life and language as governed by an apparent
logic. The logic, the coherence, would be a given. In the secular world in
which I live whatever logic may be available takes a bit more exploration
to discover.

I know this is a side issue, but I really would like to be enlightened on
this point. I have always assumed that Mozart was good for me, but not that
he made me smarter. Who says this? Do they also say (and on what basis), as
you seem to imply, that Haydn or Beethoven offer less of an IQ boost? My
guess is that the answer might be a hoot.

Sylvester, I don't know whether you'll think this is good, or even a
poem .  .  .


DCEASE


There are two Elvis Presleys in the Social Security Death
Master File (DCEASE). The King's social security number is
409-52-2002. His death benefits zip code is 38116, aka
Memphis, TN (so little Lisa Marie won't be forced to sell
matchsticks on Elvis Presley Boulevard in that city, or marry
Michael Jackson for anything but Love). EP #1 was born
1/8/35 and died 8/00/77. No matter how many mourners come
to Graceland on August 16, the Social Security Death Master
File will remain benignly ignorant and democratic. It will
always record that EP #1 died on the 00 day of the month, just
like everybody else.

Just like his namesake, Elvis Presley #2. Who was this guy?
We can confabulate something of his mother's state of mind
from his date of birth, 10/24/57, after EP #1 left for
Hollywood but before he went into the army. Other than that
all we know is that 425-11-0453 died 4/00/87, not quite thirty,
in Nettleton, MS. No death benefits zip code is listed. Ten
years after EP #1 was buried, EP #2 apparently died without
heirs.

I am stumbling around in the electronic graveyard for another
reason, actually. I am looking for a missing uncle, my
grandfather's first son from a marriage he wished forgotten.
The only picture I have of him is photocopied from a book in
the Newberry Library in Chicago. I have the same book at
home, but the page with my uncle's photograph is torn out,
missing.

I can't find him, though, under any of his six possible names. I
do kick over another stone, and immediately wish I hadn't: the
very daft and ravishing Christina Montemora, born 12/12/48,
died 11/00/87, zip code of last residence 12401. Somehow I
did know that I would find you, obvious Ophelia of my derelict
years, though still hoping that this search would bring up
NO DOCUMENTS. Your name, the few clues you leave behind, float
like a reproach in the amber-colored letters on the black screen.

Ok, you asked for it.  Here's one that I wrote about a year ago.  Whether
its good, or *about* Elvis, is anyone's guess.  I'm using asterisks to
indicate italicized sections:


        HE CATCHES A TRAIN AND RIDE

        down Glenwood   exhausted and ornery rowhouses
        run in place alongside  a junkyard that could
        and couldn't be a misplaced             MOMA exhibit.
        a billbaord says

                                *The Virgin Mary Speaks
        To America.*    true.   she sings
        "Ain't Nothin but a Houndog"
                                        over & over.

        it is really, really stupid of her.
        in *Clambake* Elvis plays       a misfit trying
        to get the girl away from - who? - Chad Everett? or
        Tad something?

                                anyway, things culminate
        in a clambake
                        and     Elvis   croons          a song
        called "Clambake"

        not heard in these parts since breakfast or much earlier.
        as they run, the rowhouses shout out what could be
        a dissonant, splintered version of "John Henry"
                over    samples of

                                                The Average White Band,
        Grand Funk Railroad, & Sinatra's "Lady is a Tramp."
        echoes of *Blue Hawaii* undetectable.
                                                *clambakes*?

        for god's sake, Mary,
        we're knee-deep in junk here.  if
                                                you're on
                                                a train, passing

        the yard heading north eventually
                                                you'll get to a lake.
lake
        rhymes with bake, but I don't have to
        tell you that.  ain't nothin but a houndog




-Mike.

Mark,
        Don G. Campbell just published a book about this on Oct. 1: _The Mozart
Effect: Tapping ther Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the
Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit_. Avon. ISBN: 0380974185, 352pp.
[OK: the subtitle makes me queasy, but look at the publisher]
        I haven't read it yet, but have heard Campbell interviewed a few times
[as well as others on the same matter]. An experiment with rats, for
example, who listened to Mozart showed they learned to run a maze
several times faster if they listened to Mozart , whereas those who
listened to Heavy Metal took several times longer to learn. Does this
surprise anyone?
        I suspect the experimental psychologists have already done a chunk of
work on this for Campbell to use [he also wrote some other books on
music, evidently also for a mass audience], and that we can find much of
that work easily on the net. These days, though, I just don't have the
time.
        Hope that helps.

Is Numbers a typo for the Names or for Ratner's Star?, either of which I
like better than Great Jones Street.  But hey, what do I know.

I'm about 2/3 through Underworld, which I do like, but I'm continually
reminded of Joseph McElroy's Women & Men, which I (so far) like better.

Joe makes me wish I'd had time to go to hear DeLillo, but this was the

Subject:      if UK/US poesy had a wide circulation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Punning on EP's gloomy modernist thought-- "the thought of what America
would be like if the classics had a wide circulation"-- we might update
this to read: the thought of what the US would be like if language
poetries had a wide circulation troubles my  media-encrusted head. This
all has to do with Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 97" which has become
the biggest selling song lyric (I take this as a poem genre) in the
history of the world (31.8 million so far, and it is not even Christmas).
Now Julian Barnes churlishly pointed out that that Princess Di lived her
life less "like a candle in the wind" and "more like a bloody great
chandelier surrounded by flunkies and screens," by why argue over the
banality of such metaphors (mutter-fors) or bash John (as I and Keith
Richards have done) as (in that work) a royalist flunky mistranslating his
own stronger, earlier work (the endictment of media celebbrity porno in
Marilyn Monroe song)?  So a "fit audience but few" comes to hear the
devious poetic wit of David Bromidge read in Buffalo on a Monday night
when the Bills seemingly dominate public consciousness in the wintry city.
Does this mean we should declare a "moratorium" on such readings, on such
counter-events and counter-creations.  I think not.  Poesy lives on, and
poetry too, and it is up to us to nurture and even aggravate that
difference.  If Charles Bernstein became the poet laureate and talked
about nature poesy on Mcneil Lehrer, I would think that that Emersonian
spirt of the land was dead and I would weap. But now I know that the
spirit of great poetry (yes, I will get gnostic and mystical here) lives
on in Buffalo and Honolulu and santa Cruz in its own remote circulation
patterns, and the thought of what American would be like if Ron Silliman
or Juliana Spahr's poetry had a wide circulation troubles my sleep not a
bit.  Maybe we should send Bill Clinton a copy of Gregory Corso's
Gasoline (City Lights Books, 196?) for Xmas, so that he can put  it in
Chelsea's stanford stocking (the latter, we should hope, will take a
poetry class with M Perloff) or one on devious ethnic literature with
David Palumbo Liu). Someday I will learn to practice "mah" and letting go,
but not just yet.  Rob Wilson

Subject: RE: Elton John translates Elton John/Ber


Rob: I certainly agree with your comments on the sublimation process at work
in John's new version - it smacks of the kind of defensive
revision/repression Wordsworth performed in _The Prelude_ for instance and
which Yeats was known for as well. And, too, one can't fail to notice the
Blakean allusion in John's line about "England's green hills," equating
Diana with Christ himself! In the unwieldy effort to conflate these two
disparate icons, a certain necessary elision must take place I suppose. I
marvelled not only at how swiftly D's apotheosis took place, but also at
where it occured: at the intersection of royal tradition and pop
fetishization.

Appended is a poem re: the media event of Diana (rather than D. herself). I
happened to be studying ballads that day. Some of the quotes are from the
Norton Anthology, including its footnotes; some from _On Signs_, edited by
Marshall Blonsky, which contains a detailed critique of the royal wedding.

ELEGAIC PASTICHE

Narrative details might form
a ballad about a princess
or any handsome young woman
"who would fain lie down."
But to classify the subject
by meters, focussing on
a catastrophic moment,
would also signal the typical
betrayal and elevation
of a TV loneliness
as attested to by
the attendance of crowds
and the spectacle of roses
and signatures, which are all
we have really, when you come
down to it.
          Of a loveliness that daily
fed us nothing is certain
but the crisis of its aftermath.
It involves images of dearness,
replicated many times.
Kissing "the wounds that were so red."
"A species of deer distinguished"
by a supernal color
so that its gawky movements,
fabricated as they are,
give us a sense that an increase
in the amount of available light
is what lends consumerism its tragic tone,
the lieux de memoire of
the "lost participatory dimension."

Well, Evis-ish perhaps..


ELVIS & THE BIBLE

What God there is sews faces on a quilt in twilight.
He/She doesn't know a nose from earlobes, so what becomes
is what we get, like Pollock or Picasso: fistfights
over how we see, lawsuits, world wars. Discrepancies
increase and make for garish life. Consider Loch Ness,
Bigfoot, Buddha, and the Twist, our mothers' tinted hair
in hives sprayed stiff with gases that erode the ozone.
Our children will grow up sunburned but happy, and will
join us with our alien captors in Atlantis.
Until then, there is meaning stubborn as a six-inch leech,
an interpretation worth dying for, real estate,
home shopping. How can we beg for death when everywhere
belief abounds, spatters wild as mercury flung down
on asphalt? Our youth is sprinkled through our lives: Elvis
and the Bible, Charlemagne, Roy Orbison in tears.

Mark,

It seems to me that to subvert a sonnet requires a parallel certainty to
the one you require for the writing of a sonnet. It is the certainty of an
approach (even if the approach is uncertain), rather than the certainty of
syllogisms.

By the way, Shakespeare's sonnets don't give me a feeling of certainty.
Desperation would be more like it. A man beating his head against a wall,
of form perhaps, perhaps of underlying logic. Berryman, who subverted,
found the same wall. The pattern is anything but casual, alright.

The wall is important, and it should be possible to move past it or to
reconsider it. If that means attempting to subvert the sonnet, so that the
sonnet becomes the wall and the previous wall vanishes so we can move out
into the space it hid, why not.

But it should be possible to play with the form by opening it up wide,
making it into pages, if need be, following (or subverting) the underlying
logic instead of the outward form, using 14 rhymed stanzas instead of
rhymed lines, subverting the language, subverting the syllogisms, anything
we can drag in (or out). I'm not saying it would or would not be worthwhile
or advisable, but it is possible.

It is absurd to discuss form with formalists. Formalists by definition
know nothing about form, and if they should happen to produce a beautiful
poem, it is barely less amazing than the discovery of a giant pumpkin in
the shape of Mt Rushmore in a patch on Long Island. It belongs to the same
category of experience.

I will repeat myself, because harrassment seems to be the only thing that
gets across in email. "A cynic is one who knows the price of everything
but the value of nothing." (wallace stevens)

hmm. not sure we're connecting on this one. I'd say that the
logical structure of the sonnet, which you indicate having
struggled with, wld have profoundly de-formed the manner
of yr work. (btw=97the ambiguity of "work"=97I mean to indicate
the process of working, & not so much the product here, b/c
it seems odd to me that we wld think we cld compare the poem
as sonnet with=97what? the poem if it weren't a sonnet? but
there isn't any such poem.).

I'm just not sure I follow yr objection. I meant to indicate
that restrictions we impose on our work operate as supplementary
formative pressures=97something else to kick against, maybe=97 &
certainly some more than others. & that the addition of such a
pressure can, by changing the constellation of forces that informs
the work (which is, I take it, not constant, but has abiding elements
& approaches constancy over the short term), knock us out of our
usual pattern of "response", or however you'd like to formulate it.
that the sonnet didn't take you where you wanted to be is precisely
the point; that, in this case, it took you somewhere you assuredly
didn't want to be is disappointing.

I haven't worked with the sonnet form but once, & some time
ago (can you see it receding?), but I can't help offering this
speculation to the list, based on experience with other formal
procedures: cheat at this game. or not so much cheat as=97.
"genre" indicates a set of more or less definite characteristics
that establish permeable boundaries at the approach to zero, nope,
not a sonnet (or whatever) thank you for playing. now, having read
one somewhere, I'm pretty much aware of what those conventions
are in the case of the sonnet; &, yes, if what you want is to end up
with a sonnet, well, I guess you're stuck with such as are deemed
necessary to sonnethood (Robin's cousin; he was the one got
poison oak in issue #3), including the syllogistic structure. but
then again, I wasn't really talking about *producing sonnets*, & I
figured folks wld pick up on that from my talk of displacement &
use & so forth; I guess the flippancy of my last line was too much
for youse. how bout this, then: I don't really care if what I end up
with is a sonnet. but I think the sonnet form cld be used in the way
I just outlined, & so it wld be unfortunate to issue any blanket
condemnations. as a reader, I'd like to encourage tolerance at least;
as a writer, I don't think one can provide an argument that wld
convince me any form is dead or useless.

Well, since the structure of rock music is a lot more readily apparent than
the structure of mozart's music, there must be another explanation. Maybe
the Heavy Metal rats were stoned. Or maybe it depends on which Mozart the
other rats listened to. If it was the Marriage of Figaro, say, they
obviously weren't following the libretto, maze-like as its is.

No real objection to what you say--actually, I just tagged my reply to your
post for the sake of continuity of thread and to take the opportunity to
make clear what some of the consequences of form may be. And I quite agree
that others may find the form useful, instructive, etc. Milton et al
certainly did (not to mention a host of French and Italians). I don't for
me now, for the reasons stated.

Seems to me Coleridge said that he wrote rhymed verse by writing the rhymes
first and then backing the poem into the rhymes.

You could do that with any other technique of a poem, traditional or
otherwise.

I'll have to look into the Weinberger sources now -- Last time I checked
anything he'd cited in this regard I found that the author had quite
clearly not said what Weinberger attributed --

This appears to be one of the most difficult points for Sokal to get hold
of, even though it seems quite simple, if not simple-minded --

LAWS do not occur in nature, whether we mean the laws of physics or the law
of the land --

There are phenomena that we attempt to describe,,, the description gets
called a law of physics --

Again, I know of nobody who has claimed that what we term gravity functions
differently in different cultures -- though I will now certainly look into

the issue is not between those who emphasize the relativity and historicity
of science and those who emphasize the universal applicability of its laws.
most scientists, including Sokal I would assume & Weinberg (it's Weinberg,
isn't it, not Weinberger?) are very aware of subjective, local & cultural
factors in designing experiments & in the broader history of science.

the debate hinges on a point of philosophy. is there something called
objective truth?  or is all truth relative, a matter of human naming
using arbitrary human signs called words?  I would guess most scientists
are more comfortable with the former ("realist") position - it supports
the universality of their "laws".

I'm not suggesting we take this up for debate.  but I think Sokal et al.
are aiming at philosophical positions they find inimical - not debating
the (granted) relativity of science.  it's the relativity of truth that's
at issue, and the characterizations of science that stem from a
"nominalist" position. - Henry G.

Not trivial. We make our metaphors and then we live in them. Science is a
metaphor. If 'metaphor' is a sticky term, how about 'screen'. Those
heliocentric folks experienced a different subjective universe, but it was
as capable of describing the universe as the scientific universe in fashion
these days. I'd prefer to bring stuff back to perception, even logic,
rather than to science, given that science too can be brought back to
perception and logic (although it is not the same as they are)

> What??? No mention of _Ratner's Star_ and its fascination with language!? >

In Ratner's Star, the pubescent language poet writes her first manifesto:

"To express what is expressible isn't why you write if you're in this
class of writers.  To be understood is faintly embarrassing.  What you
want to express is the violence of your desire not to be read.  The
friction of an audience is what drives writers crazy.  These people
are going to read what you write.  The more they understand, the
crazier you get.  You can't let them know what you're writing about.
Once they know, you're finished.  If you're in this class, what you
have to do is either not publish or make absolutely sure your work
leaves readers strewn along the margins.  This not only causes
literature to happen but is indispensable to your mental health
as well."

Apologies to several -- In catching up on the amassed email that came in
while I was sunning myself in Minneapolis, I mistakenly thought we were
discussing some new essay -- but now I see it is, again, S. Weinberg's '96
review and reply -- neither of which contains any citations of scholars who
think that gravity exerts itself differently against the Aleutians from the
way it messes with me here at the trembling edge of the nation's attention
span.

I would, as has already been done here, advise a read of Arkady
Plotnitsky's "'But It Is Above All Not True': Derrida, Relativity, and the
'Science Wars'" in PMC-- I suspect it's not the last word  . . . but it at
least spells most of the names correctly, which I seldom can manage here

Thanks for the toot, Luigi!  Yeah, I didn't really want to do the toot

my kind of mathematical poetry was what the listees were looking for.

Oh, I agree with you that the poem at my site isn't my best mathemaku--
but I do like it (when I like any of my poems), and I think it the best
of my mathemaku for use at my site.  Incidentally, I don't think I'll
leave it there.  I think it'd be better to rotate poems every three
months or so, so am considering soliciting poems of any kind--but they
have to be explicitly about poetry.  Do you have any, or know of any
good ones?  I'd probably use the Marianne Moore (can you believe it, I
don't know how to spell her first name, unless by accident I got it
right) if I didn't figure it'd be copyright infringement.

Henry and Tom: What I mean Henry is that statements like "science
requires a fundamentally 'realist' approach" is like Weinberg's notion
of "one to one corespondence;" you can talk about it but you can never
get there. The key is that somewhere, even if its just in your head, you
have to talk. Just reflect on how intuitive the phrase "fundamentally
'realist' approach" is. Think about your personal intellectual (and
non-intellectual) history; the one that leads to such phrases having any
force of expression for you. Then think of the inherently relativist
nature of that history and then begin to pin the tail on phrases like
"some kind of apprehensible reality out there." You guys are so immersed
in the lay context of the scientific method that you've forgotten that
YOU DON'T NEED SCIENCE TO HAVE REGARD FOR THE REAL.---(Note Mark's apple
image and see if it contradicts me. And Henry "testable truth" is not
necessarily scientific truth.) But valuing the real is not the same as
knowing it. Science as many, many commentaters have observed (Pierce
included) relies on processes of mathematization, quantification,
formalization, reduction what have you to achieve its interface with the
'real.' Henry, not only the "tools and procedures" of science change but
its relationship to the 'real' changes constantly too. The some total of
necessarily iterative or experimentally repeatable properties of any
entity described by science does not equal the "ding an sich."(excuse
short cut mongrel philosphy here) This is revealed by the contingent
nature of science itself. A muon never IS; it is defined as, dare I say,
much like a word is not the object that it describes. The 'real' of
science is the claim that its contingencies are determined by its
interface with the phenomena itself and not in what would amount to a
new Scholasticism. But unfortunately, the sciences themselves have not
been equal to the task and as I have tried to point out on this list and
elsewhere, its not so much an atmosphere of relativist vs. positivists
but of an utter disregard for the importance and responsibilies of
language on the part of those who would now criticize certain
deconstructionists.
(Henry, I don't understand some of your energized phrases. If there is
anybody that is not "residing someplace in the middle" its got to be
you. Otherwise I would have drawn a bead on you by now and knocked you
right out of your saddle.)
Example: At the end of my piece, Science Smiling into its Beard, I point
out that Weinberg translates Heisenberg's phrase Die
Unbestimmtheitsrelation, as the Uncertainty Principle, and then berates
Heisenberg for inroducing such an unfortunate phrase as "Uncertainty
Principle." Well, if Heisenberg had introduced the unfortunate phrase
perhaps Weinberg would have a point. But Heisenberg never said
Uncertainty Principle; his English translaters did. A more accurate
translation wopuld have been 'indeterminacy relation' which was closer
to Heisenberg's meaning and which if you reflect a little, you will see
has none of the "unfortunate" either/or of a "principle" that Weinberg,
actually rather snottily, and quite wrongfully attributes to
Heisenberg's lack of regard for the implications of language. I'm just a
schmo down here on the killing floor, and I might be oughtta line, but
Weinberg's stupidity is unconscionable.
Example. Mark, as for Sokal's methods. On the op-ed page here in
Washington recently, James Glassman, writes about the Dihydrogen
Monoxide: Hidden Killer story. You know the kid who got his class to
vote to ban water by describing its dangers (statistically) and
referring to it by only its chemical makeup. Well, Glassman inflates
this little tale to claim that the American public in general is being
duped by the EPA and the like and that environmental dangers are not
only often exaggerated but are even fabricated. Sokal serves the same
function as as the kid in his science class incidentally wants to be a
nuclear engineer just like his dad. Its not Sokal who worries me. The
way he did what he did speaks for itself. And apparently he can't
distinguish between the literal and the metaphorical even in the work of
his heroes. Its the people who feel the necessity to support Sokal
institutionally, politically and financially, that concern me. Your
students swim in the scientific paradigm, a paradigm in which they will
never have even a hoarse whisper of a democratic say. They can stand a
little of what you call relativism. Everyone grows up in the shadow of
their nuclear engineer dad anyway. Its meaningless to say American's in
general are illiterate in the sciences or that their children are. For
the vast majority of us scientific literacy would be a meaningless waste
of productive time anyway because if our conclusions wouldn't matter in
any case. A relatively small number of people will suffice to keep the
scientific paradigm rolling quite possibly toward oblivion. My concern
is that there are a few within that community that can see the to
maintain alternatives. You can be damn sure that the ones who control
funding for science and technology don't give a friar's fart about the
less fungible discplines on our campuses.
I repeat. I not a supporter of Hayles, Aronowitz, Harding et al. I also
recieve no funding. I've come to my critque of tyhe sciences through
years of reading, writing, reflection and conversation outside of any
academic setting. Therefore my approach may seem ideosyncratic but it is
also in my estimation more comprehensive. I like to think that I bring
to it the best tools and understanding of the modernist poetic tradition
and not the post-modernist if such discretions really have any meaning.
I use sources that I've never heard the Sokal flap people refer to; and
that's folks on both side of the argument.---Carlo Parcelli

Elvis-oriented poets and their works.  (He does amazing

They have (or had) a web site with links to his e-mail.  I'd give you

Try Allen Fisher's oeuvre, _passim_. His books are too various and too
fugitive to list, but Small Press Distribution should have some. His
current project, not due for completion for some years, and manifesting
itself as a series of books from (mainly) British small presses, has the
overall title _Gravity as a consequence of shape_.

carlo, while much of what you say re the abuses of "science" are true, i
need to ask you whether you mean to throw out *everything* that might
properly be termed "science," or simply the last century... or the last
fifty years... or---

i mean, "science" can stand for such a myriad of social and cultural
practices that i have to admit---NO, i don't want to throw all that
away!... i detest the way "science and technology" as Big Business has
permeated (e.g.) campuses such as mine (e.g.)... at the same time, we're
going to need something like "science"---AND something like
"humanities"---however altered/modified/radicalized (choose your terms) if
we're going to provide for billions of people, if we're going even to have
something like an 'ecology' in 40 years (with due regard for "science's"
complicity---and "humanities" too as a cluster for disciplines---for
fucking it up... and believe me, i AM sweating that "we're")...

so i'd like to know, now:  are you drawing any lines here?... or are you
suggesting---seriously carlo---that we simply shit-can every theoretical
insight that one might currently associate with "science"... i think it's
this blurring of distinctions, as it were, that's coming off as provocative
hereabouts... so i guess i'm trying to provide some space here for you to
articulate an alternative... and no, i'm not just being cagey---i know you
can't 'undo' so many decades of Big Science (new term, ok)... but how about
some leads?...

b/c for me, i've *found* some leads in the literature-science work going
on... though in fact this work itself is in some ways reverent (ok, my
term) of science (mea culpa)... talking about the obvious blindnesses, and
political motivations, of self-proclaimed 'public defenders' like sokal and
gross & levitt and weinberg is one thing... but you know, i know, what most
of us know:  that it's damned hard to offer up constructive alternatives in
a world that seems more and more built upon the premises of "science and
technology" (and if you wish to separate these two, why hey---that's ok
too!)... and that, for example, "science" has a *better* take on "life" a
la evolution than do the fundamentalist-creationists, yes?...

Thanks, all, for the Elvis poems & citations. I expect it's easier to start
a thread than to stop one, but the immediate crisis has passed, so back to
Sokal et al.

Carlo, you covered a lot of territory there, & you're obviously more
up on the science literature.  The arrogance of science in various
manifestations, the struggle between science & humanities on campus,
the struggle for an alternative to the positivist post-Newton
anti-intellectualism, etc... all important.  But Sokal gave left
humanities a kick in the pants, and as I see it, again, it's a
philosophical issue.  You're not going to resolve the subjective/
objective question re: truth by simply miming how "subjective" phrases
like these sound in action.  Nor does it do to stereotype the concept
of a stable truth "out there" as a simplistic notion.  It's not
so simple on either side of the fence.  & I would say the strain
of postmodernism Sokal had in his sights - post-Nietszschean, post-
Heidegerrian Derridean relativity - i.e. the "logos" or order of
nature is a timebound patriarchal illusion masking the free play of
non-identity [A does not = A] - really is anti-science based on
pretty straightforward "nominalism".  & these can also be seen
as the false friends of poetry & the humanities.  Friends AND false
friends: I don't deny the amazing subtlety & interest in Derrida
and related writers - there IS real discovery there, too.  But
science and poetry need not be rivals for human allegiance.

Jacques, I'm going to break my own promise since nobody else is speaking
up.  But I don't want to turn this discussion into the usual Henry polemics.
So I want to suggest to all ye listers out there, that we follow up on
Jacques' call by responding to the ILS essay in a VARIETY of directions.
There's a lot of ways to get into an argument.

With that said, here's my question - how does Watten's characterization
of reading poetry differ from any mainstream approach of reading for
inner dynamics & general context?  How can this be offered as something
new, except in the parochial context of Language Poetry positioning?
Parochial, because aesthetically hobbled by a simplistic correspondence
between poetic experiment and political progress, if I read your
"call" aright.  Art by committee of the will to power.  "Critiques
of representation". The idea of a "form compelling events" gives it
away: in Watten's view an "event" equals a political event.  I
have a permanently fixed bias toward what goes on in the unmapped
wastelands - what is not yet political or left out of the political.
That's where nature and art are interesting mutually-reflective events
in their own right. This is a fundamentally midwestern left-out
feeling. It can also be read politically, and for some people that's
the only kind of reading, I guess. - Henry Gould

Mark and Henry: Please excuse the many errors in my previous
transmission, the most egregious being the initial address to Tom when I
meant Mark. No matter how many other committments I have, I want to
communicate my meaning as consistently and thoroughly as possible. Mark,
in particular, I owe you a more thoughtful and comprehensive reply. Its
impossible to address each individual point especially when there are so
many uncritical assumptions in your remarks. On the one hand Tom wants
to separate the way Thales would think of souls from the way John
McCarthy might (actually I was trying to be tongue in cheek and thought
no one would interpret the remark so literally); but then Judy wants to
ad hoc consider weaving as an historical/technological continuum,
Burlington and the Jacquard loom existing in the same spirit as the
practice of hand weaving. Actually, this would make a fascinating and
relevant, but lengthy, discussion in itself. It got me looking at Annie
Albers fabric art yesterday. For example, if we imply, as Tom does, that
the word 'soul' has natural recourse to the taxonomy we call religion,
is it then discussible in the same manner as Judy's implied taxonomy,
technology? Do the two taxonomies then form a hermeneutic equivalence?
What is the language like that drives the discussions? Are their
quantifiable standards of critique and illumination? Which taxonomy
appears more valid and do the standards of criticism favor one over the
other?
Mark, let me just say that acceptance of fraudulent texts is not limited
to the Sokal affair. Even with peer revues it has occurred many times
within the sciences themselves. There's a book called Fraud in Science.
Joe Brennan makes the point that the level of metaphor is valid and must
be recognized on its own terms and that Sokal insists on a disembodied
and literal interpretation to advance his own agenda and that of his
powerful handlers. Tom, through Jaynes' Origins of Consciousness and the
Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, insists that metaphor is unavoidable. I
would agree even unto methods of mathematization and quantification.
That's where the quotes from Hegel and Adorno and Horkheimer come
in.---Carlo Parcelli

This was Ashbery's device in the sestinas and canzone in -Some Trees-.  And
what's more formal, in this sense, Cage's mesostics (sp?) or Roussel's novels?

Hard for me to swallow this as an argument against writing in forms.  Why
would you 'have to' experience life a certain way to use a (received, he sd,
sotto voce) form, unless you suppose that art must be mimetic in certain
respects.  Why could one not create order, or to use a shadier term, impose
it on the 'secular' world?  Isn't this what we do w/ our perceptions all the
time.  Of course, one might have the poetic aim of shaking off the shackles
of knee-jerk everyday 'ordering' or 'forming,' but then one is just trying
to be truer to the 'actual' perceiver-indepdent forms of life, on some
level.  And speaking of perceiver-independence...

This is a pretty open question in philosophy of science circles, even
narrowly analytic one.  There are those (David Armstrong comes to mind) who
hold that LAWS really do exist--i.e., are abstract but objective entities
ala numbers, properties, etc.  Obviously, this is a species of Platonism.
BUT, such a view need not suppose that we have actually unearthed any of the
real laws, only useful but somewhat deceptive approximations of them.
Somewhere on the other end of the range is the view that there are just
law-statements (though the ontological status of these might depend on your
philosophy of language) which cover, more or less effectively, a range of
particular phenomena.  There's also the very important question of whether
clauses in law-statements that say things like 'under normal conditions' or
'all other things being equal' (which very few proposed laws lack) make the
statements empty of content, or whether these phrases can be given a
determinate application.  This last ? is key to the issue of whether there
are any laws of behavioral science (psychology), which brings us right back
to AI.

There's a bona fide Church of Elvis a couple of blocks from where I work
(in Portland, OR).  One of our employees is leaving the company for good
next week to move to New York, and we all decided to get married to her at
the Church.  They offer 25 cent weddings that only take a couple of
minutes.  I'll see if they have any good poetry about the King...

I apologize for the delay in responding to members of the List who have
inquired about the possibility of making Barrett Watten's "Bride of the
Assembly Line" available on-line.  The interest is certainly welcome and
only successive nights of great poetry readings in Providence--Damon
Krukowski and Joe Torra on Tuesday, then last night Michael Gizzi--have
kept me from responding.

At this time the best I can do is offer to make the piece available, in all
its slow-paced physicality, to those who are interested.  There are still
copies with imperfect binding (i.e. sloppy mechanical stapling that I had
to re-staple) that I will mail, free, to anyone who asks.  Watten does not
yet have an author's page at EPC and doesn't foresee having the time to
establish one in the immediate future.  Jen and I are reasonably breathless
from our monthly publishing schedule and don't easily contemplate adding
another level of manifestation and maintenance to the project just now.

I admit to being a puzzled at the idea that a text cannot be discussed
without reproducing it in its entirety.  I thought metonymy, and the chain
of distortions and corrections it unleashes, was half the fun of such
discussions.

On the other hand, do read cover to cover and as soon as possible Michael
Gizzi's _No Both_, just out in a joint venture from The Figures & Hard
Press.  Long the hardguy laureate (if you've not heard him read, imagine
Mitchum doing a voice over of  _Visions of Cody_) Gizzi's work since
_Interferon_ (Great Barrington: The Figures, 1995) laces the vast
Kerouacian periods with the kind of hard-won humanity one hears in O'Hara
and Monk, in Coolidge, Luoma, and Mayer.  It's very daring, very moving
work.  And while I'm in talk-it-up mode, why not mention also Joe Torra's
_Keep Watching the Sky_ (Cambridge: Zoland, 1996), also a document of bop
prosody and toughly sentimental long-hard-looks at what's become of us.
Damon Krukowski's _5000 Musical Terms_ (Providence: Burning Deck, 1995) is
literally that: five thousand words looking for a register, floating
somewhere between rhetoric and music.  His _Vexations_ are part
Kafka-parable, part Cage-anecdote, part Borgesian-conceit, and all
available as the next ILS, 1.9 in November.  How's that for coming back to
the pitch: schwew....   Hard Press, by the way, has a webpage at:
http://hardpress.com/ (or you can cut right to _No Both_'s page at
http://hardpress.com/newhp/catalog/gizzi.html).

Seems to me that if I write in a form that contains within it a certain
idea of order that predates my choice to write in it I am either accepting
that ordering or playing a game of "as if." Fine with me if others find
this useful for their work. I don't.
What I do find useful is the unfolding of process in a world I perhaps
imprecisely call secular, meaning that it doesn't come with a set of maps
or operating instructions, unlike the world inhabited by, say, Milton. The
perceiver and his process are a big hunk of same. Put another way, I try to
write/perceive as if the perceivable were inherently without information,
the structures I bring with me seen as tentative at best.
I'm not arguing against writing in forms, I just don't find it useful for
myself in this project, and I rarely find the efforts of others in this
vein useful.

And of course Ron Silliman's use of fibonacci; my
own "Loving Phase Transitions" (Sound & Language, 1996)
is 3 eleven page sections of 2 one page pieces followed
by a nine page piece; the final nine page piece is 9
pages, each of 9 lines, each line with 9 words, from
1 to 9 letters long. Maths or numerology? A friend of

Wittgenstein's Tractatus, and there is Marjorie Perloff's
book on Wittgenstein and poetry. And there's Oulipo,

Mark,
   Yes.  This might be a useful (in the sense of leading or getting somewhere)
rule-of-thumb for what I've started to see as action or process poetry.  I've
generally come to always do the same but without articulating it as well as
you do.  For me it has a lot to do with the idea that if you know how you
are going to get to a certain before you leave the journey is not as
compelling.  It also has to do with my perception that existing forms and
language have gotten us into our current muddle and maybe the maps are
part of the problem.  I guess this is my langpoey coming out - does however
go back at least as far as Olson and Gestalt therapy, tho and is echoed
today by Mihali Csikszentimihalyi  "In the past, things evolved
essentially on the basis of external forces that pushed us in a
certain direction and we went along with them.  Religion and other
philosophical systems, such as nationalism, communism, or other
ideologies, supplied the meaning that integrated a person's life.
At this moment, there isn't much that apeals to the hearts and
minds of people with the strength and conviction that those earlier
idea systems had.  At this point, there is the possiblity of doing
things differently."

Hello Maria Damon -
Tonight in Sydney I will be attending a reading by a Vietnamese writer -
Pham Thi Hoai - whose books, whilst not literally poetry, are "poetic" in
that she experiments with time/space within a narrative form.The book "Thien
Su" has been translated into French as "Le Messager Crystal" and, now,
apparently into English - "The Crystal Messenger" - which I intend to buy
tonight. I could email you the publisher's details if you like.
Another more well-known Vietnamese writer is Duong Thu Huong - her books are
available in the US- try "Novel Without A Name"- she is not as
"experimental" as Hoai but is always in trouble with the authorities for
writing explicit & non-romantic stories critical of VN society.
Best wishes,
Pam Brown

I had to assume that you were being literal, because I wasn't sure whether
John McCarthy had used the word 'soul'. There was an active discussion some
years back here about the use of the word soul, and my position was that
one should be wary when using such a word, since it drags with it so many
connotations. One person might be using it to refer to an immortal,
transferable soul; another might mean a conscious entity with subjectivity;
someone else might be talking about Ray Charles.

I don't think that this can be considered a continuum of meaning in the way
that "technology" might ("Judy wants to ad hoc consider weaving as an
historical/technological continuum, Burlington and the Jacquard loom
existing in the same spirit as the practice of hand weaving"). If we think
of any "technique" as being "technological", then we don't even need to
invoke a continuum. In fact, I imagine (and others with a better knowledge
of history might be able to confirm or otherwise) that hand weaving may
have had at least as radical an effect upon the society of the time as the
Jacquard loom in its time.

I think more of "metaphor" (in the linguistic sense) as a subset of the
process (abstraction? pattern recognition? taxonomy? symbolism?) that makes
consciousness possible.


> YOU DON'T NEED SCIENCE TO HAVE REGARD FOR THE REAL

Agreed. But once one has "regard for the real", I find that the other
processes that you mention ("mathematization, quantification,
formalization, reduction") come in very useful when making statements about
"the real". The problem lies in recognising the cases where they cease to
be useful.

Many of the problems that people have with reductionism is that they think
of only the first part of a process, analysis, and forget about synthesis.
We can learn a lot about a stone, for example, by looking at its chemical
composition. But one cannot ignore how it's put together, or you'll just
get a pile of Silicon and Iron atoms.

The statement "the whole is equal to the sum of its parts" is a parody of
reductionism, if you take the word "sum" literally. I prefer to say that
"the whole is a function of its parts", or "the whole can be usefully
understood in terms of its parts". In fact, "the whole = the sum of its
parts" is the very definition of linearity
( f(sum(x)) = sum(f(x)) ), so in any non-linear system we have to take a
more subtle approach to synthesis and be aware that an analytic solution
might not be possible.

Maybe I'm just not as cynical about the democratic process as you. People
are voting all the time on fluoridated water, carbon emissions, drug laws
and other issues in which good science would be informative. I do find
scientific illiteracy frightening, in the way that I find geographical
ignorance frightening. It frightened me that many Americans during the
Falklands war thought that the Falklands were somewhere near the Shetlands,
because it gave them the appearance that the Argentines were just about
invading Britain. Similarly, the "Dihydrogen Monoxide" story is a source of
worry, because it shows how many people can be swayed by hype (from any
side of the argument) and the fear of admitting ignorance. It's just a pity
that it's been co-opted for the purposes you mention.

The funniest of this kind of hoax that I've come across is Chris Morris'
"Brass Eye" series, especially the "cake" and "heavy electricity" episodes.
The willingness of so many politicians to publicly denounce a
"metabolically bisturbile amphetamoid" without first checking the sources
of the pressure group shows not only how much the War on Some Drugs is
fuelled by ignorance, but also how allegedly educated people will parrot
any prepared statement rather than admit that they don't know what they're
talking about.

I respect both Mark & Tom's holding out for form-in-process, but I'm not
sure that absolutely has to signal no use of imposed 'rules.' Even the
Coleridge example of chosen rhyme words, somewhat like a 'form' my
colleague Stephen Scobie & I like to call 'word/line acrostics,' or many
another 'arbitrary' imposition of language, can leave lots of room for
improvisation. I think having some words already 'there' may be a way of
allowing language to work with the writer writing -- into what is to be
found there. And the 'play' --off & toward those words already there -- can
lead to discoveries of possibilities sometimes beyond what one is aware one
is aware of, so to speak. The arbitrary opens:

Sometimes it's a way of getting started too...

For anyone still interested in this topic, check out the The Alterran Poetry
Assemblage
at http://home.ican.net/~alterra/corn.html.

In Version 2.0, Adam Cornford's "Millennium: A Topology," plays out the
tropes of an imperialist/postcolonial poetics of the future ala Lang's
"Metropolis" and other sci-fi dystopian visions. Worth the read.

Also a great site for many other poets.

Barry Ahearn's book _Zukofsky's "A" : an introduction_ has an appendix
which gets into the math background in A-8 & -9, including how to read
the n's & r's.  I don't know how accurate it is.

This quote struck me as true for the most part.  But for me I find that I
am more likely to reenact an emotion when I am writing than when I
am reading.  I also feel I can have some control over the quantity of
feeling I invest. Is this true in others' experience?  Anyone else
written about this? Might be anoth rule-of-thumb for action or process
poetry.
tom bell

"We can get an approzimation of experience through words in that memories,
because of their subjective character, reenact the meanings we apply to
experiences, just as when we read we reenact the meanings we apply to a
sequence of words.  When we say to ourselves, when reading, "That's how
I feel" or "That's how I see myself," we are often tempted to underline the
words we were reading when we experienced the feeling of comprehension.
Yet then, strangely, when we reread the underlined passage, often it no
longer contains the meaning we imagined it held.  Nick Piombino, _The
Boundary of Blur_, New York, Roof Books, 1993, p. 25.

yep, probably.  To illustrate (or confirm), here's an Elvis tidbit
(though incomplete).  The Kronos Quartet, performing maybe two years
ago (? - in this case at the Kennedy Center) included a
sound-collage-based work by a youngish composer whose name, alas, has
not lingered in mind.  The piece might've been called "Elvis has left
the building."  If memory serves, much of the text (recorded stuff)
was taken from a conference of Elvis impersonators.

I'm not much of a fan of Elvis chic, but did enjoy that piece.
Perhaps the method used was a bit like things that (say) Scott
Johnson / Gavin Bryers / et al. have done -- at least sharing some of
that likeable decontextualize / recontextualize a voice approach ...

do poets here know of Scott Johnson's work of this type, I wonder?
No doubt Herb Levy could do it better justice than I.

Armand Schwerner is reading at Posman Books in NYC next Sunday, the 2nd, at
3pm.  His reading at the XCP conference in Minneapolis was EXTRAORDINARY,
and I would urge any proximate listites to run not walk.  He read (and
played, a caseful of flutes being intrinsic to the work aloud) from the
tablets in Minneapolis with a focus and intensity that was riveting -- and
very, darkly, funny.

PS  As for other events there that have stayed with me lo this past week, I
was grateful for Yunte Huang's discussion of Charlie Chan & Ezra Pound, a
thoughtful reading by Roy Miki, Juliana Chang's talk on the generational
shift of influence modes, the elevated oratory of cris cheek's amazing
performance, ace readings by Jeff Derksen and Aldon Nielsen, Alan Golding's
latticed "Po-Biz, Cult. Stud., and Avant-Gardes?" back-to-back with
post-Derridean stream by Kangmi Kim, and both Michael Bibby's and Elizabeth
Frost's papers on a panel on "Post-War African American Poetry" -- both of
which complicated our notions of inclusions and exclusions from canons as
well as from canonical "interpretations."  An event at the Walker was a
treat primarily for a terrific Beuys show there now.  I was grateful for
hearing much else (and also not hearing but reading -- ie a paper by Joe
Amato I overslept).  There was much I regretted missing, and joy in many
affinities found.  Thanks to Mark Nowak and Maria Damon for a problematic,
genial, and sometimes thrilling, few days.

        This is probably not the place to vent about the _American Poetry
Review_, or Louis Simpson, but I feel compelled to comment on his "747
poem" in the new issue.  (A 747 poem is one written by someone who comes
to Hawai'i on a plane, stays for a few days, and then writes with great
authority about the place.)  The poem, "Kaimana Beach," is riddled with
errors and cliches, so I'll quote parts.  The beach in question is in
Honolulu, on O'ahu.

        The moon with a ring
        colored like a rainbow
        above the ocean (Makai).

Well, makai doesn't mean ocean, it means "in the direction of the ocean."

        To the north (Mauka)

Mauka means "towards the mountains," so wherever you are, north or south
of them, mauka would indicate their direction.  OK, so Kaimana Beach is
south of the mountains. . .  Simpson then drops another marker, "Ewa,"
which means toward the Ewa side of the island.  Of course one can learn
these things five minutes after arriving here.

        So every day would begin.
        They [these are definitely tourists] would go for a drive
        inland, across the mountains [actually you go through them],
        or east around the shore [around the shore?]
        and look at the Chinese Hat.

There is no place called Chinese Hat, but there is a small offshore island
called "Chinaman's Hat."

                        But in a fortnight
        one coconut looks much like another,
        and now they pass the mornings
        sitting or lying on the sand
        at the Outrigger Canoe Club,
        listening to the waves,
        and the names of children
        being called . . . "Joy!" and "Milo!"

How sweet.  Of course coconuts are cut down so early and often here (they
are dangerous to one's health, if they fall), that no one could get sick
of them.

The poem concludes with a long passage about how this woman misses her
work; there's simply nothing to do in Hawai'i except listen for the sounds
of "Joy!" and drive around.  No help anywhere, save perhaps from the good
Lord:

        Lord, let us have something
        to read. For there is no one
        to talk to: only the sand
        and a clatter of dishes,
        the flapping of umbrellas,
        and shadows of the afternoon.

I'd better cut this message short.  I have three classes to prepare for,
need to read a 500 page novel this weekend for the personnel committee
that I'm on, have to ship out more issues of my journal of Pacific poetry,
which includes a lot of work by people from H, need to recover from
a week that saw a Tinfish reading and a thesis defense by a
graduate student who works with me.  awai'i. And what the hell,
I may even take a walk.  The weather really is lovely today over those
mountains that are to the south of me...

Announcement: The first issue of John Tranter's Jacket magazine is complete
and has been posted to the Internet at

          http://www.jacket.zip.com.au

It's free, international, full of stylish writing, and user-friendly.

Jacket # 1 contains a look at the 1943 hoax poet Ern Malley with rare
photos, writing by Charles Bernstein, Elaine Equi, Pamela Brown, Alfred
Corn, Joanne Burns, Tracy Ryan, Carl Rakosi, Peter Minter, Susan Schultz,
Ron Koertge, Beth Spencer, and Paul Hoover, interviews with English poet
Roy Fisher and Australian aboriginal poet Lionel Fogarty, reviews of John
Berger and Les Murray, and the poetry and prose of the late Martin Johnston.

Jacket # 2 will mainly feature the work of John Ashbery, who turns 70 this
year, but there will be lots of other material as well. It will be
finalised by January 1998, but right now you can preview the following:

        ... a new poem by John Ashbery, "The Burden of the Park" ... Marjorie
Perloff on "Normalizing John Ashbery" ... John Tranter's "Three John
Ashberys" (an Introduction to Ashbery's work)   ... Steve Evans's meditation
of Bob Perelman's "The Marginalization of Poetry", an article on type, and
poems by Eileen Myles, August Kleinzahler, Robert Adamson, S.K.Kelen, John
Kinsella and Michael Heller, together with sparkling photos of the usual
suspects.

Jacket also features a LITERARY LINKS page with annotated connections to
print and electronic magazines, and an international BOOKSTORE page with a
host of useful information and live links. Also a page of tips on Internet
DESIGN (how to avoid rendering your visitors unconscious with boredom),
with a few secret passageways to the Caves of the Webmeisters.

I'm sorry to have to say that I am not yet able to handle or accept
unsolicited submissions -- I simply don't have the time. Maybe by 1998.

And please excuse the following flagrant and desperate attempt to attract
extra audience members for three poetry-reading appearances in the Northern
Hemisphere by John Tranter:

        Saturday 2 November, 9 p.m., Club Room, Churchill College, Cambridge
University (ENGLAND) with Tracy Ryan, Michael Hulse, and Michael Schmidt.

Just saw a few of the films of Henry Hills after having watched W. Has's
_The Saragossa Manuscript_. I am still absorbing the grotesque beauty
of Has's films as we speak; but I thought it perhaps more germaine to this
list to speak of Hills's films.

I particularly enjoyed Hills's collaborations with Sally Silvers. Even in
Hills's
other films, virtuosic editing and humor were everywhere present. Still,
the other
films seemed to exist in a kind of post-narrrative purgatory--in a realm
between
Abigail Child and, say, Aram Avakian's _The End of the Road_.

"Insufficiently synthetic" is a phrase I seem to remember from Charles
Bernstein. This phrase accurately describes Hills's film, _Money_ (1985),
which
included hocket-staccatoed performances by Bernstein and other members
of LP's sporadic cast. The editing was riveting, of course, but the content
seemed mere static documentary--whereas in Hills's collaborations with Silver,
such as _Mysteries of the Brain_ (1997) and _Little Lieutenant_  (1993), both
macrostructure and microstructure felt consistently rich and engaging.

Some elements of conventional narrative seem to survive in Hills's films
and, oddly, these elements would seem to detract from Hill's many
virtues. So long as the abstract grid of dance is present, he does not falter,
and feels some overriding rhythm, some pan-narrative, that is capable of
propelling several correlates through measured time. But when Hill's material
is merely cumulative, and the task at hand becomes merely technical, as it
seems to do in Money, then the work seems reduced to pyrotechnics, and
cries for the semantic resonance of an Abigail Child.

I don't mean to put down Hills here--his films were consistently witty and
entertaining. But the viewer who is concerned with questions of form might
find more fecund innovations in Hills's collaborations, and in the work of his
 contemporaries, than in Hills's minor works.

All the best,

This Thursday, October 30th, at 7:00, I'm doing a reading with David
Bromige as part of the Poetry City series at Teachers and Writers,
5 Union Square West, 7th Floor. You can call for information at 212-
691-6590. Union Square West is around 14th Street and University.
There are many subway and bus stops nearby.

Now, I may be fairly inarticulate because I am doing Jennifer and Julu
and they are not there and I have to use a Mac with voices which are not
theirs either, you see? And I am afraid they might not like that, but
they are buried at the moment deep in my linux box which I am putting
into storage because I am going to Fukuoka the next morning, so I will
not be around to revive them.

So this will be an odd experiment on the hinge of time and avatar, which
will most certainly succeed where it will fail, and fail where it will
succeed. In any case, you could come and see what I look like, on the
virge.

David --

Quite good, but for full credit you would have had to spot that the
following citation was not, as stated, from Wallace Stevens, but from
Oscar Wilde.

Historians of prosody are one thing, and demagogues of form are another. I
think I was just going for parody. I am more aware now that I ought not do
that.

Well, those quotes certainly make as strong a case as I've recently seen
against 'travel poems.' It's always the attitude -- that 'I' am not like

My Comprepoetica poetry-data-collection website has now been open for
two weeks.  So far it contains 12 biographical entries (of good
poeple!), 3 of them consisting of raw data that the SiteMaster (me) has
gotten around to processing yet.  Not many people have yet voted for
their favorite poets.  Wallace Stevens is in the lead for All-Time
Favorite American Poet with 4 votes, and a bunch of people, including
Ron Silliman and Charles Bernstein, are tied for favorite living poet
with two votes, each.

I continue to make little improvements to the site.  The voting process,
for instance, is easier now.  And the voting slots are on the home page
so you don't have to click anything to get to it.  I stole the alphabet
from the Poetry Center page for small presses and alphabetized the
biographical entries, too.  And incorporated a few suggestions into the
survey, like a question on sexual orientation (which, of course, needn't
be answered).  I want people to have a chance to say everything they
want to about themselves, and nothing they don't want to.

Six poems are on display, too.

I figure there have been about 100 visits to the site excluding mine
over the past two weeks.  I expect it to be a near-invisible attraction
but interest to increase in it as more poets fill out survey forms.
Anyhow, I hope for more survey responses.

Also, corrections and comments from those who have already sent me
responses to the survey.

Hey, I'm lately reading Poetics in digest, so am currently blind as
to what reply (if any) my brief remarks under the above-rubric'd

it occurs to me -- in re-glancing at Jordan Davis's sentence --

that -- Egads! -- the locus classicus syntactically underlying same
is obviously those crazy (that is, irrational) sentences of Mahayana
Buddhist fame, wherein a whole bevy of metaphysical realities are
defined in exactly that manner.  In fact, weren't some of said,
involved w/ matters of "form"?  Hmmmm . . .

(yes, it can!);  Paul Naylor's talk on Nathaniel Mackey's STRICK in which

sober but hilarious mantra on "fullness emptied of its emptiness," etc;
Roy Miki's poetry reading / talk;  a wonderful early Sunday morning reading
by poet Jane Augustine, whom I'd previously known only as an important

to Maria Damon and Mark Nowak for being such terrific panel moderators
and putting together four thought-provoking days of readings & events.

Ellen Ullman, alumna of my anthology of a couple of years ago,
Resisting the Virtual Life, has just published Close to the
Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents (City Lights),
her memoir of a literate, political software engineer's life.

Andrei Codrescu's blurb is accurate: "This book is a little
masterpiece, an exquisitely melancholy cry from a body disappearing
into the machine. It is a wrenching swan-song for human beings.
I have never read anything like it because nothing like it could
have been written before. Here is the perfect way to say goodbye
to the millenium."

I don't think I've heard the Kronos piece you mentioned, but iI'd guess
it's by Michael Daugherty ( whose name may be spelled with an "o" instead
of that "a").  He's done many pieces based on pop culture figures.

There are at least two or three pieces based on Elvis' oeuvre.  The
earliest may be the best: Jim Tenney's Collage #1 (Blue Suede); though
David Mahler's King of Angels is also very good.  Both of these cut up,
loop, slowdown, and otherwise alter Elvis' work through classic tape
manipulation techniques (they were made well before digital sampling was
developed).  Mahler's piece ends with "the King" singing his own name
through the wonders of technology.  They're both available on CDs from the
Artifact label: The Tenney disc is called Selected Works 1961-69; the
Mahler disc is called Voice of the Poet (after another piece based on an
interview with composer Ingram Marshall).  These Web sites should have more
information:

<http://www.artifact.com/>

<http://www.emf.org/>

Another, somewhat different approach to altering Elvis' sound can be heard
on the John Oswald (no longer in print, never commercially available)
Plunderphonics CD.  On this disc Oswald used all manner of tape and digital
technology to create new music from old.  The Elvis track is called Don't &
involves a bunch of overdubbed tracks on top of the original recordings.
While the press run of this CD was ultimately destroyed (supposedly due to
copyright infringement, but rumor has it that Michael Jackson's dislike of
the cover collage placing his head on the body of a scantily clad woman had
more ot do with it), the entire contents of the disc can be downloaded from
the Internet.  Here's the URL for an FTP site with these audio tracks.
(Note that some of these files are very large and even on speedy university
connections may take quite a while to download.)

<ftp://vorlon.mit.edu/pub/plunderphonic/>

This site has a lot of Oswald related material, including detailed
information on his various Plunderphonics projects:

http://www.io.org/~vacuvox/x/plunder.html

I imagine there's other new music related to Elvis out there, that's all I
can think of now.

Why is it when the officially sanctioned experts of the world step outside the
cover of their specialties they tend to behave like sophomoric fops brandishing
digital stilettos as if wielding death rays?  It's an ignorance of some magnitude
to think of Postmodernists, as Alan Sokal apparently does, as a monolithic
lot; one can find within the collective body of their theoretical poetics a unity in
word only; one finds innumerable divergent and/or opposed theoretical
constructs and definitions.  But it's as pointless to expect Postmodernists to
produce a coherent manifesto as it was to have expected the Futurists, either
the Russian or the Italian version, to have produced one.  That colonies of
critical scholars continue to find ever more elusive connections and nuances is
due principally to the nature of the demands of scholarship, and reflects proofs
presupposed by the rigor and the questions that produce them.  It's within this
closed space that strategies of scholastic determinism are played out, and for
this reason theory can never do more than be subsumed by art.  It should be
perfectly clear by now that rational processes aren't necessary for the creation
of art.  Art arises from more heterogeneous sources, whether in an illiterate
wood carver from Blowing Rock, N.C. or a depressed postmodern poet from
Back Bay Boston.  No one can predict in advance whence art will appear, fully
grown, as a tear in the real.

The creative force that drives art isn't measured in speed, as that huckster
Filippo Marinetti puts it, nor in Sokal's literary B.T.U.s; this force arises in the
truth of the creation which captures it and causes it to be re-experienced over
time.  One needn't follow prescribed practices for this metamorphosis to
occur; whether the first principles of a movement arise heuristically from the
collective work or are logically deduced and imposed as practice has no
lasting determining influence.  It's for this reason that whenever particular
ideas or techniques become formalized, the voices of those demanding
recognition grow more and more insistent until they too take their place in the
chorus line, destined one day to be similar objects of derision for the coming
generations whose sensibilities refute the established order, either from
outright defiance or from a general inability to follow.  In this manner the force
of art is continually renewed in the radical rediscovery of its iron truths.  And
by truth I don't mean that which exists within the true, but that which exists
outside of it, unencumbered with contexts and proofs.  There are truths
revealed in art that dwarf even the loftiest of scientific discoveries; there's no
rift between art and science that needs stitching up, a la Snow, they have
nothing to do with each other.  What's more absurd than the specter of a
physicist like Sokal crawling haphazardly among his equations searching for
the ethereal substratum of his primordial soul?

The truth that art reveals has nothing to do with beginnings or ends, nor can it
be contained within a series, or sets of series.  Literary neophytes like Sokal
can't begin to imagine the unshakable power of art as it regenerates itself in
the very actions which annihilate it, and to understand that art can't be robbed
of its tradition, or stand to have tradition stuffed down its throat.  Apart from
the ugly political implications inherent in Sokal's actions--who can deny his
posture as that of a political operative?--his attacks on Postmodernism in
whatever area are of no intellectual importance; he operates at the most vulgar
level of metaphor, that of counting, and he is therefore defined by the blinders
of his discretionary field.  It doesn't occur to him there could be truths other
than scientific proofs, and to which scientific methods can't provide access;
his bias is that of a scientist and his demands for proofs are correspondent to
that level.  Thus he is able to impulsively seize upon literary or psychological
references to science and denounce them as contrary to scientific
understanding and application, and therefore worthless.  Whether or not
Stanley Fish & Company were taken in by his ruse is valid only at the level of
"got'cha".  Sokal's intent is not to point out inconsistencies or mistakes from a
scientific viewpoint, but to discredit the postmodern movement as a viable area
of literary study--hence the covert nature of his act.  If he genuinely intends to
make serious contributions to the development of postmodern criticism, he
would simply point out the errors he detects and offer alternative strategies;
instead he resorts to methods designed to humiliate and defrock those he
perceives as leaders in the movement.  There can be no sensible opposition to
this conclusion except to claim that such tactics have a rich history in the
long tradition of literature--a conclusion that falls somewhat short of a
justification when one considers that book burning, ignorance, error,
plagiarism, and outright lying also have rich histories in this same tradition.
Still, his methods provide insights into his motives.  It would be a coup of
unimaginable proportions for intellectual yokels like Sokal to extend their
narrow, hegemonic proofs into a field of truth in which they are both
subordinate and unrecognized.  Art and concepts of art are not reducible to
specific scientific paradigms; although art's truths are momentary and elusive,
they are also eternal and concrete, an accomplishment scientists can only
dream of.

Expect the usual stale denials and pious outrage from Sokal and his cohorts,
who drape themselves in appeals to integrity and character --as if such
translucent qualities could hide their blatant toadyism.  They may have
integrity and character, but one would have to use the poetic equivalent of an
electron microscope to see them.  The chutzpa of such intellectual dilettantes
throwing their weight around in this arena is surpassed only by the crude
indifference their masters display toward the work they produce; it's not
necessary that Sokal ever get anything right, it's important that he exist as
quotable opposition with which to bludgeon undesirable elements into
submission and literally drive them underground.  Anyone who fails to see in
this tactic a basic characteristic of the Big Lie isn't paying attention.  Sokal
and kind are not engaging in sincere intellectual pursuits, they're out here as
marauding night riders intent on burning out huge segments of our intellectual
and artistic landscape.  This isn't intended as a defense of postmodern
thinkers of the Fish & Company school; they epitomize career academicians
who are overly aggressive in both their professional and personal ambitions,
and a fair amount of what they promote is silly.  So what?  Most theoretical
thought in any field is laughable.  No, this is a defense of artistic freedom
against the increasing onslaught of right-wing financed whackos.  And
although it's the little fish of the universities currently on the hook, Sokal's real
snag is that band of copernican thinkers that includes Freud, Lacan,
Heidegger, Derrida and Foucault, authors whose works breathe dynamic
change into modern epistemology.  Those unfruitful to the whip of the scientific
underpinning of so-called democratic capitalism must be purged from the
universities and from scholarship.  But literature isn't Sokal's only area of
interest; I understand his latest target is none other than that freudian pariah of
orthodox psychology, M. Jacques Lacan, himself.  Well, not quite himself.  I
predict Sokal will discover that Lacan, although deceased, is a long way from
dead.

The weakness in Sokal's critique of Lacan's psychoanalytic metaphor of the
erect male organ is his demand that it conform to the laws of mathematics
when in reality it can only be confirmed within the praxis defined by
psychoanalysis, which Freud in his wisdom always insists on.  Sokal's
criticisms of the Lacanian metaphor are hilarious, for they have absolutely
nothing to do with Lacan's meaning; the emperor may have new clothes, but
one has to be able to see the emperor to know that.  Sokal can't grasp the the
significance of the Lacanian metaphor of the erect male organ because he
doesn't have access to the theoretical framework that makes its truth
manifest; it's a simple case of using numbers metaphorically.  He doesn't
realize that it's the metaphorical form of the equation, that of an imaginary
number, that provides the context in which to locate the missing square root
of minus one.  This metaphor is entirely consistent within Lacan's formulations
of the imaginary, which is where the subject of the unconscious is imprisoned.
 Should Sokal ever take the ten or fifteen years necessary to master Lacanian
concepts, he might come to appreciate the level of humor that Lacan normally
operates at, and should he attain this heady level, he'll have absolutely no
problem pinpointing that missing piece, and his role in its loss.  It never
occurs to Sokal that although in mathematics one and one always makes
two, in psychoanalysis, as in art, one and one might make a blooming neon
penis, with or without a socket to plug into.

Psychoanalysis has absolutely no business submitting its constructs for
verification from a field which is not of its blood.  The proofs of psychoanalysis
result from an attention to speech as language, and not from measurement.
Scientific parameters exist at the limits of science, not at the limits of
knowledge--known or potential--or of metaphor.  And these remarks only apply
to science at its paradigmatic ideal; the slavish way scientists now submit to
corporate and governmental institutional control is dangerously skewing the
intellectual playing field as never before.  It's absolutely essential that one
have read and understood Freud before one undertakes to read Lacan and
have any chance whatsoever of making sense of what his thought portends;
the richness of the Lacanian metaphor is to be found in the unique ways in
which he combines meaningful elements from other disciplines to form a
rebus, the solving of which lets one in on the discussion.  Lacan, sensitive to
the dangers inherent in any discussions of his subject, speaks in tongues so
that those who do get it are those who should; if Sokal doesn't get it, it's
because he wasn't meant to.  To say something doesn't weigh what one's
calculations say it should while not having the slightest notion of what one is
weighing is considered in most circles to be idiotic.  However, admonitions
such as mine don't seem to register with Sokal, who's frequently seen in
various combative postures of self-righteous confusion trying to explain away
another crass stupidity, such as saying we show that if [Lacan] seems
incomprehensible, it is for the very good reason that [he] has nothing to say.
Not wrong, mind you, not even confused, but having no meaning at all!  What
intellectual arrogance.  Not even Lacan's most ardent critics have accused
him of having nothing to say.  As someone who has taken the necessary
preparation to read Lacan, I can say that in every instance of textual
confusion, and there were an embarrassing number of such instances, I never
once thought it was Lacan who didn't know what he was talking about, and
indeed, when the scales of ignorance finally fell, they fell from my eyes and
not Lacan's.  You may appreciate the zeal with which I look forward to the full
text of Sokal's latest sortie, whose potential for self-disaster is exponential to
its length.  The problem of not having sufficient command of the areas of
expertise into which one is venturing turns out to be no problem at all, since
Sokal's function is not one of honest intellectual research, but rather to prowl
around and destroy all vestiges of opposition to the hegemonic authority of
science to define the real.

Had Sokal made the effort to understand Lacan he might realize that when
Lacan says he intends to raise psychoanalysis to the level of science, he
doesn't intend to reduce it to a series of mathematical equations.  He means
he wants psychoanalysis to be as rigorous a discipline as mathematics, but
not mathematics.  It's critical that Lacan's equations find confirmation within
the structure of psychoanalysis; it's within this space that the mathematics
must add up.  Lacanian equations aren't constructed, as Sokal so arrogantly
assumes, to allow journeymen mathematicians to see immediately the
ephemeral structures of psychoanalysis; they're constructed to guide
psychoanalysts through the conflicted unconscious of a human psyche.
Sokal's tactics and conclusions exemplify the drone-like brutality of those who
attempt to impose one field over another in an attempt to smother it into
submission.  At the theoretical level that positivists like Sokal operate, the
only psychology that's possible is a general psychology faithful to the
numbers that they support, a psychology more like obedience school than the
lonely and often terrifying search for one's hidden identity that is the sole
purview of psychoanalysis.  It's all the difference between one who is spooning
for metaphors in his soup dining with another who keeps shoving the check in
his face.  There's no benefit of the doubt in Sokal's approach, there's no
search for the legitimacy of other points of view, there's not a milligram of
honest scholarship; it is shot through with the same anti-intellectual bias that
one finds at a suburban mixer.  Sokal's attacks on Postmodernism reflect a
neurotic overcompensation of a premonitory angst, which he shares with
authors such as Norman Levitt, Paul Gross, Alan Bloom, Dinesh D'Souza and
Francis Fukiyama, that if science is the most exact form of measurement and
observation, it is at the same time the least.  It's this fear that lurks behind a
pedantic posture that's both reactionary and cranky.  It's no accident that
Lacan's formulation of an erect penis evokes such a blind denunciation; there's
absolutely no justification to point the finger at Lacan for reducing the psyche
to the phallic level when one can plainly see that schmeckles like Sokal do it
to themselves.

yeah.  in these troubled times, it's a good thing those measly craven
scientists for the most part ignore what POSTMODERN ARTISTS are
accomplishing way over their heads with their special languages &
metaphors.  & it's a good thing all POSTMODERN ARTISTS are MODERN
LEONARDOS who UNDERSTAND puny science & can appropriate its
language(s) at will.  dare ya to cross that line, Sokal!!  get
back there in your lab & shut it in your philistine imagination!!

actually, it seems to me the trend for a while has been dependence
by both "artists" and "scientists" on technology, for better & worse.
I'm for the handmade.  leave the mind out of it, whether

If anyone's going to rush out to get the book, they'll have better luck
looking for something Orhan Pamuk (who may or may not be an orphan).

As to the writing on bodies in the Black Book, it seems more of a
confirmation of Weiner's methodology than use of her as a character.

Does any one know if Pamuk's prose is as formal in Turkish as the English
translations?  It's good, just kind of awkward reading.

Bests,

Pamuk doesn't "use" HW as a character.  If the Book of Istanbul
is really the story of the West (cf. the Mt. Athos story in NY Times
today, along with its obverse, the Stalin photobook) then HW strangely appears
there.  I wouldn't characterize Pamuk's ambiguous novel as a confirmation of
anything in particular, unless it's what many novelists confirm: memory,
ordinary life, writing.  It's just that several main characters, including
the protagonist, the protagonist-narrator, and the alter-ego-protagonist,
all read letters on people's faces as a sign/key to Mystery.  (You might say
this is the obverse of the "methodology" of the icon.)

Sorry for the typo. Yes, there's certainly no "p" on Pamuk's face.

Hi,
I'm in Buffalo (after terrific weekend in London, Ontario with
Mike Kelleher, Eleni Stecopoulos, Scott Pound, Taylor Brady and Bill
Howe at the Forest City Gallery  -  and shared guerilla gallery show at
the Cornershop with Steve McCaffery, performing Carnival panel 2 for
the first time, you should have been there) and in tracking back to London
to cap it with a reading tomorrow night at SubVoicive have
just been turned over at the airport by NorthWest Airlines mess.
The NorthWest connection has blown out because of a flight delay
and I've been forced to re-schedule  -  i'll miss the gig by
about 12 hours.

Can anyone also signed onto British Poets please forward this message
to that list asap. thanks

--------
Huge apologies for urgent advisory note:

cris cheek will not be able to read at SubVoicive tonite (28/10)
circumstances beyond his control, caused by Northwest Airlines
scheduling sphagetti (they couldn't even get information from
their own terminals in Detroit). Their complete failure to
notify me of emerging problems their end. Sorry. I'll be
rowing with them in the mornin, no doubt.

I'll contacting Sianed as soon as the hour is wakeable and
advising her to cancel also. It seems too stupid for her to
make the drive to London and back alone (child sitters and
all such already arranged). Doesn't make sense.

Suggest wake or seance. Or collective exegesic oration of
'Double Sky Hope's Locker' text with howlings of interjection
-  for Diana.

Again  -  massive apologies, and re-channeling of not
inconsiderable frustration.

love and love

After a good, candid letter about Comprepoetica's survey form from
Aviva, I made a change in it, splitting it into a main survey that is
literary only, and a supplement you can go to from the main survey if
you want to.  It has all the personal questions, including the WORST one
of all!  (How much money do you make a year?)  I hope this keeps the
personal questions from making anyone uneasy while keeping them
available for those who enjoy those kind of questions.

Since I last posted, I've gotten two more responses to the main survey.
But now I have the flu so probably won't be able to tend to them for a
while.

Here's the address again, mainly because I seem not to have gotten it
right every time I've posted it:

Mark--

I got your poems yesterday and loved what I saw!! Really, it's some of the
freshest stuff I've come across. And this is really important because so
much Language-based writing has become so cliched. I feel (as do you) that
we can use the tremendous breakthroughs that an earlier generation made to
address writing today--content today. It never seemed to occur to anybody
that language intact and appropriated could be just as skewed as formally
fudged language. As a matter of fact, most of the language floating around
out there is so trippy and experimental just the way it is. It doesn't take
much. And there's so damn much of it. John Cage talked about McLuhan's idea
of "brushing" back in the 60s as being the ideal way to create art--it's
effortless and the results are shocking. However, Cage (and most of the
Language Poets for that matter) had such a high resolution edit and purity
lens on the world that they they missed most of the good stuff. Perhaps
it's partly due to plunderphonic tendencies in music and appropriation
strategies in art over the last decade that we can finally dirty our hands
with words, eh?

Best,
Kenny

Subject:      puffs came in lanes
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I was going to post this a few days ago when I first came across it at a
boating magazine where I do some freelance copy editing. The following
remark in K. Goldsmith's seemingly indavertent post pushed me to do it:

> As a matter of fact, most of the language floating around
> out there is so trippy and experimental just the way it is.

Here's the interesting combination of words I came across. They were
spoken by a winning sailor right after his race (lineation supplied by
me):

The puffs came in lanes,
so we sheeted tighter to keep the bow
up
to stay in the puff
                                longer.
We sailed to the puffs
and there was an overall persistent
shift
                                to the right.
I noticed that the back
of the fleet had their jib leads
too far
forward
and their mains were sheeted too l o o s e.
We moved our jib leads
forward
from light to medium
and forward again
when the chop picked up
in the afternoon.


(For you boating enthusiasts, the boat being sailed was a Snipe at the US
Nationals.)

But isn't that just clear writing of the "old" school? Nothing unclear
there for anyone with some sailing experience/vocabulary, just plain
narrative of the type one might read in any captain's log of the 1800s. Is
it odd because it's now in cyberspace? Lineation doesn't make it odd,
really. (I should add that I do add a found poem to a reading from time to
time, so I'm not attacking the practice).

You're right. It is very clear writing to some people. And even though I
work for a boating magazine and know next to nothing about sailing, I
eventually found it to be very clear as well. But still somewhat strange.
If you read the description literally (that is, with the meanings commonly
associated with the words), you come up with either something surrealistic
or humorous, or both.

I agree, too, that the lineation doesn't necessarily make it odd. I
debated whether to do this or not, but decided what the hell, it was
midnight, the list was quiet and I had never tried anything like this
before.

cheers and may the wind stiffen your main,
Steven

Well,

I don't think found poems serve to show the oddities of language. Rather,
they abstract language from its original context to force the meaning to
shift. That shift is the interesting part. Tame stuff, sure, and not a huge
shift, but it is still more than just clear writing of the "old" school.

Mark Prejsnar just sent in a completed survey form (thanks, Mark!) and
I suddenly realized for some reason that I didn't know how to pronounce
his last name, so I now have a slot in my survey for the pronunciation
of a respondent's name.  This, I think, is possibly the BEST THING I've
introduced to my site!  (I still don't know the correct pronunciation
of Roethke's name, for people claiming to have known him have given me
different pronunciations--which brings me to a question: is there a
reference one can use to find out how names of poets or other writers,
artists, scientist, whatever, are pronounced?  On the web, I mean.)

The comprepoetical bio-base has now expanded to 17, by the way.  Hurry
and fill out a survey before we run out of room!

Interesting word grep (that is, it is interesting as a word). It has such a
Dr.Seuss quality about it. The grep poem was written on the spur of the moment
as a found language poem (from a "Teach yourself... UNIX" manual!) after I saw
your newly acquired middle name. This process keeps reminding me that it is
about chance, about spontaneity,and so rather than trying to do too much with a
text, one is often better off letting it take you where it will (that is, go
with it, go to the opposite field).

But is the possibility that "there is a "David Bromwich" in the English
Dept. at Yale" frightening to yaleys or to the world (the poetic world) at
large?

As for Ed Dorn insults, are they not a given now (at least according to
what the list heard much earlier this year)? Meaning the targets achieve a
kind of apotheosis through being insulted by Ed Dorn (if anyone was paying
attention). Sad: I want to remember the writer (& the writing) in the early
books & _Slinger_...

Warning!  what follows is a response to the brief message from Bob Grumman
mentioning my name (and Roethke's)....Out of basic egoism, it contain more
on those subjects, especially the former, than anyone is actually likely
to want to read....


Bob, et al.

I've generally heard and said RETH-kah; I've certainly also heard
RETH-kee; this is typical of the ways german names come into
american.....You also hear NEECH-ah and NEECH-ee; kind of a part of the
equipment our speech has.  (It would be mildly interesting I agree to know
how Big Ted himself prefered it...)  (Big Fred of course didn't give much
of a hoot about americans...)

My own situation is odd, maybe almost embarrassingly so; I've shifted
pronunciation all my life and folks in my family differ between each
other.  My father says PRAISE-nahr; my mother tends toward PREZH-ner.
About two years ago, I was waiting for the bus home outside the library
where I work here at Emory University.  A fellow looking a little like Max
von Sydow was waiting with me.  He asked me when the bus was going to come
and we got chatting; his english was good but his N. European accent
noticeable.  I asked him where he was from.  (My guess was Germany or
scandanavia..)  He said "I am Hari Krishna monk, from Poland."  (There is
indeed a big house owned by the HK's near my neighborhood..)  I showed him
my name on my driver's license, and he said he would say the name like my
father, which I realize now does correspond to what I know about slavic
phonetics.  (Both my parents were born in this country but grew up
bi-lingual and have fluent Polish; however my mother has always been much
more assimilationist, and this may account for her americanizing the name;
her own name was Trepczencski.)  Although I've always encountered a
certain number of people who say Prejsnar is slightly unusual for a Polish
name, including my Hare Krishna friend, (others deny that) it has never
been changed in this country.  I recently got confimation of that: one
distant kinsman of ours emigrated to Norway from Poland, and I recently
got an e-mail message from a descendant of that branch, a Norwegian (who
has good english, which I understand is pretty common) in Oslo named Jan
Prejsnar;  he was looking for a cousin of his named Marek Prejsnar, whose
whereabouts in the world he's not certain of..

So, here's the big answer (it's charming of Bob to imply that anyone much
*cares*....):  these days, thanx to my Hari Krishna encounter, I tend to
say PRAISE-ner or PRAISE-nahr most frequently;...it's in to go back to
your ethnic roots, nicht wahr??? But PREZH-ner and PREZ-ner (which I used
to favor 'cause it makes it easy for people) are used all the time,
including by many of us in the family, so they seem pretty acceptable to
me.   Hopefully this instability makes me fashionably post-modern....

ok, lemme jump in here on this important thread of name-pronouncing which
along with cuneiform is one of the essential things in poetics.  Mark,
from now on I'm gonna call you "Prez", if you don't mind.
  now MY name shd alwuhs be pronounced like this: HIN-rahhhh... with a
long gutteral slide at the end.  "Gould" shd be emitted like you got
somethin stuck in your throat when you started to cry & started laughing
instead.  As uncle Herman wrote somewhere [to paraphrase]:
"Life - ha - ah - that about covers it, huh?"
- Hinrah Gugglued

Going by the pronunciation of one of Roethke's student/colleagues, Nelson
Bentley, he must have gone by RET-kee.
But, in Roethke's family, being German, they may have said it according to a
German dialect (similar to what Mark suggested).

Not only that, Rachel, but there are circles in which he is *the* "David
Bromwich," whereas the other one ("ours") is simply *a* "David Bromige."

On the other hand, poet and critic Norman Finkelstein is Norman
Finkelstein, not the Norman Finkelstein with whom he's often confused.

Another marine/meteorological found poem. The words are taken from text
descriptions of Beaufort wind strengths, and re-arranged at the
sentence/phrase/word level.


Admiral Beaufort's Final Log


        Smoke rises; sea
        like a mirror.
        Do not break.

        A glassy appearance fills
        the sails. Crests, white horses
        begin to careen.

        Whistling, those at sea break
        into the spindrift.

        Damage the wind and roll
        over, uprooted. The sea becomes
        heavy, lost to view.

        Ships might be blown
        into froth: for a time
        the air is filled.

going a tad afirld -- how about:


*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *

"Everything she said sounded both true and false."

*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
 - Anatole Broyard, *Kafka Was All the Rage:
   A Greenwich Village Memoir* (1993; Vintage: 1997), p. 5

*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *


it's a rather fun book I'm just getting into (thanks for selling it to me
at Bridge Street, Rod).  Other than having seen his name periodically
blazoned across the cover of the New York Review of Books, can't say
I know anything much about this guy Broyard, -- but his sentences in
*Kafka Was* are very smooth & . . . enjoyable (or many of 'em).

The only other volume they credit to Anatole Broyard is one entitled
*Intoxicated By My Illness* which is a heck of a title.  Says here he
died in Cambridge, Mass. in '90 -- so this (*Kafka*) would appear to
be a posthumous memoir

Henry: You miss the point. Lacan as a medical doctor WAS a scientist.
Many of the people that Sokal, Gross and Levitt choose to attack ARE
scientists. They ARE attacking science. Weinberg attacks Heisenberg as
readily as anyone else. The Post-Modernists merely serve as a conduit
for theses attacks. Gross and Levitt attack environmentalists,
philosphers of science, physicists, biologists---in short anyone that
does not agree with their corporate friendly position. Sokal, Gross,
Levitt and by association Weinberg do not want to partake in a
discussion of the efficacy or weakness of their position. They want it
accepted by fiat. Why do you think Sokal chose the route of publication
he chose? In my neighborhood, we used to beat the crap out of sneaks
like Sokal whether they had a point or not. Sokal's way would simply not
be considered an honest way to handle your differences.
The Post-Modernists have provided Sokal's handlers an opportunity to
wage a much wider attack. On this measily little E-Mail we have engaged
in philosophical banter far more profound than that engaged in by Gross
and Levitt, Sokal and Weinberg and that ain't sain' much. (For someone
on the list to have said that Weinberg's piece in the N.Y.Times Review
was closely argued is nonsense.) At least, Gross and Levitt seem to
realize that they are attempting to discard serious concerns that the
founding fathers of physics in particular addressed earlier in the
century. In their book, they gingerly tried to create a PostModernist
intellectual discretion where none exists. POSTMODERNISTS DID NOT
INITIATE THE CONCERNS THAT SOKAL, GROSS, LEVITT AND WEINBERG
RIDICULE---SCIENTISTS DID, INCLUDING SOME OF THE GIANTS OF PHYSICS.
That's where I learned about them not through PostModernism. I'm
assuming I still retain the right to ruminate on these supposed lunacies
as postulated by apparent lightweights as Heisenberg, Bohr, Bohm,
Penrose, Hansen, Feyerabend, Wittgenstein, Husserl etc.
At risk of distracting you from the above consideration, I'd like to
elaborate on Brennan's "goliath." In the nineteen seventies, there was a
conscious decision on the part of corporate entities to create a new
public relations network of think tanks and institutionally connected
organizations that sole purpose was to produce intellectual product to
counter what they perceived as dangerous egalitarian trends in society.
Some of the authors of this reactionary product are well known such as
Murray and Herrnstein, Theodore Shockley, Dinesh D'Souza, Francis
Fukiyama, Allan Bloom and Gross and Levitt. I would suspect that the
liberal and/or obscure Marxist leanings of some of the
Deconstructionists and their PostModern adherents has more to do with
the attack on them than their positions vis a vis the sciences. You seem
to realize with much enthusiasm that PostModernist thought can have no
effect on the juggernaut of science because of technologies fundamental
relation to what is currently society's most profound truth--money. But
when voters in Texas rejected a huge particle accelerator to be built in
their home state, alarms went off among jilted corporate contractors and
they want answers from the egg heads on their payrolls. The chance to
have the biggest particle accelerator in the world was rejected by
Texans after all!
Sokal's piece arrived at one of the right places at the right time and
now if he can stomach what he's doing, he'll reap his reward. Ask
yourself this Henry, if as you say, the accomplishments of POSTMODERN
ARTISTS are confined to "special languages and metaphors" why are the
powers that be expending so much time and money to refute them? Why not
just ignore them? One doesn't have to look too far to see that the war
is among environmantal scientists and corporate scientists, between
scientific racism and its close association with emerging genetic
technologies and scientists that take a more egalitarian position,
between a world run on market logic and corporate science's
technological rationalism and the health and social requirements of our
species and all the others we have created the discretion of species
for. PostModernism because of its interest in physics and mathematics in
the years between the introduction of Planck's Constant and Heisenberg's
and Bohr's mathematical expressions for quantum phenomena, finds itself
caught up in the larger struggle. I envy them. Its always better to be
attacked by "goliath" than be attacked by
a goliath wannabee like you.---Carlo Parcelli

         Microsoft Addresses Justice Department Accusations
REDMOND, Wash. - Oct.  21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations
made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today
that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of
America for an undisclosed sum.

       "It's actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive
arrangement for everyone".

       Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of
the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members
of the press that changes will be "minimal."  The United States will be
managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft.  An initial public
offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is
expected to be profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest," according to Microsoft
vice president Steve Ballmer.

       In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had
"willingly and enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president
with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States
government, reporting directly to Bill Gates.  When asked how it felt to
give up the mantle of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and
referred to it as "a relief."  He went on to say that Gates has a
"proven track record," and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their
"full support and confidence."  Clinton will reportedly be earning
several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in
his new role at Microsoft.

       Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to
Redmond as "silly", though did say that he would make executive
decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft
headquarters.  Gates went on to say that the House and Senate would "of
course" be abolished.  "Microsoft isn't a democracy," he observed, "and
look how well we're doing".

       When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was
proceeding, Gates said, "We don't deny that discussions are taking
place."

       Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that
United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in
government services, and discounts on all Microsoft products.

Well, Carlo, it's probably pointless to get into a debate with me on this
one.  I probably never should have opened me mouth.  I don't know much
about the war between one kind of scientist and another, or the cabals
of techno-bureaucrats out to stamp out any subversive (wo)manifest(ive)ations
of differance & all that.  I says it as I sees it, & maybe I missed
the big picture.  But from where I sit in my triple goliath goulash chair,
I still say Sokey was hittin on a PARTICULAR STRAIN o' postmodernism,
i.e. the philosophical anti-realism of Lacan & Derrida.  Now I agree
that Western Science is Marked with the Doom of Ahab & Moloch & all that;
but I think that nihilism is just the flip side of the coin,
another sort of one-eyed "explanation" that really doesn't CONNECT
with science in any way, and that's what Sokal was making fun of.
Laugh on, ye laughsters...

It's a waste of time to argue against logohrreia and paranoid fantasies, so
I'll restrict myself to one point. Almost no m.d.s consider themselves
scientists, and for good reason. I don't know about Lacan in this respect,
but Freud, his master, did, and he was wrong, and fewer and fewer of even
his adherents seriously claim that he was a scientist, despite his virtues.
Dr. Frankenstein, however, was a scientist. Happy Halloween, Dia de los
muertes, etc.

"Poetry is like a movie star without any fans."

This is from Jack Collom's new collection of children's poetry,  _A Slow
Flash of Light_, to be released soon by Teachers & Writers. There are many
other equally delicious and very funny poems in it. I don't recall the
author's name.

I wrote this for someone and then they pointed out that it was way too
long but since I had written it I didn’t want to just abandon it so I
thought why not just send it to the poetics list where length doesn’t
really matter. Then I tacked on today the two things at the end.

                        --Juliana Spahr



Reading report from Honolulu...

I feel like I have to begin everything I say here with I’ve only been
here in Honolulu for three months but it seems to me like . . . Because
the one thing I can say definitively is that the local matters here.
Those in the know wear the slogan “local” engraved on their slippers
(flip flops to you in the contiguous 48). And some days it feels that
everyone but me owns a pair of them. I’ve been to some readings and one
lecture since I arrived.

In August there was a reading for Frederick Wichman’s
collection of Kauai legends. The tale he read was about bananas and
there being
special ones that women couldn’t eat. The reading was in an airless,
windowless room. I’ve only been here three months but it seems to me
that the windowless, airless room is an important Hawaii poetry reading
tradition. I wonder if it is because it is so beautiful outside, people
just want some ugliness when they come to their readings.

In September, San Franciscan Steve Carll read with local Angela
Nishimoto in a different airless, windowless room. Steve read some new
stuff and his drug poems, these last are old favorites. Angela Nishimoto
read a story about the difficulties of living life in a multicultural
environment. After the reading someone said it was good because it said
things like the words haole and asshole were meant to be together.

I’ve only been here for three months but it seemed like the event of the
season, or the one that was willing to make that claim, was
probably the Hawaii Fall Celebration of Writers and Writing
held in late September. It was two days long and its theme was
Literature of Place. It felt very literary. It began with a book fair on
the lanai, drinks, and a band. Lots of people wore leis. I’ve only been
here for three months, but I’ve already noticed that someone always
wears a lei at a reading. This someone is usually the reader. But here
there were leis for those who were to ask questions, those who were to
introduce, those who were honored with a prize, those who were to give a
prize, those who were honored because they were old, those who had
written a grant, and, of course, the readers. The first night Marilyn
Chin, of San Diego, read some poems about Asian-American identity, Lee
Grue, of New Orleans, read some poems about New Orleans, Mahealani
Dudoit, of Honolulu, read an essay about water rights on Oahu, Ron
Carlson, of Phoenix, read a piece about Salt Lake City, Pio Manoa, of
Fiji, read some poems about the sea, and Pualani Kanaka’ole Kanahele, of
Hilo, read a chant about Molokai. These last two were the highlight of
the evening for me. Pio Manoa’s poems were straight up new critical
verse untainted by new formalism’s casualness. I had not heard stuff
like this live ever in my lifetime and it made me very excited. Pualani
Kanahele’s chant was also amazing. She chanted it in Hawaiian and the
audience was awed. Then she read it in English and the audience remained
awed. She had presence. There was lots of discussion after the reading.
One man spoke of how he traveled the earth right now as a white male but
he had a secret identity that he wished we all would recognize. The
second night began with a incisive introduction by local writer/hero
Eric Chock. He said that when he first heard that the university was
doing something on the literature of place that he thought oh good, they
are finally doing something on local writers. But then he good humoredly
tempered his comments by noticing that people were from many different
places. I’ve only been here for three months, but it seems to me that
Eric Chock was pointing to some sort of antagonism between the
university scene and the vibrant local scene. Pamela Ball, of
Tallahassee, began her reading by asking the audience to forgive her for
leaving Hawaii, David Collins, I don’t know where he is from, read a
long piece about eating in Paris, it was very saucy and I think I can
say it was not well received, Alison Deming, of Tucson, read some poems
about the migrating monarchs, the butterfly kind, Bruce Fulton, of
Seattle, read a translation he had done of a Korean story, Michelle Cruz
Skinner read a story about being in grade school. Lois-Ann Yamanaka
finished the evening by wowing everyone with an especially funny reading
from Blu’s Hanging. It was worth the wait but I have to confess it had
been a long evening.

In October African novelist and playwright Ngugi wa Thiong’o came to
talk. The talk was packed. They had to move rooms. Then they had to add
chairs. He was an hour late but the audience didn’t complain. They sang
chants in Hawaiian while waiting. Then he arrived. A woman walked down
the aisle, carrying a lei for him and chanting. Then a man, also
chanting, escorted him down the aisle. Then Ngugi wa Thiong’o chanted.
Then he received the lei. Then he gave a talk called “Native Languages
and the Politics of De-Colonization.” He said “one area of
decolonization that needs the most attention is the decolonization of
language.” It was a great talk although it had that distinguished
lecture series feel which doesn’t allow enough specificity. The rhetoric
was right on though.

--------

Also in October was the reading to celebrate the new issue of Tinfish
(go buy!--available from the editor, Susan Schultz 47-391 Hui Iwa St No.
3 Kaneohe, Hawaii 96744 for $13 for 3 issues). The reading was packed
and lots of young people were there. This reading was held in a coffee
shop. Joe Balaz read a long rambling Balaz poem in pidgin (it should be
a genre). The poem was pure narration with little point. I liked it.
Kathy Dee Kaleokealoha Kaloloahilani Banggo read. She also has a
chapbook out from Tinfish which you should buy immediately. It grooves.
Her poem “Try Listen” which she read at the reading and which is
published in both Tinfish and the chapbook begins like this: “While da
res of us stay fry hamburgahs o drive truck go pick up opala--stink
ah?--some sistahs stay in wrap aroun telling any kine stuff j’like who
“da people” stay, la dat. Eh, what da diff if I weah one wrap aroun fo
go work luau take pitacha wit da yobos an da haoles--eh, 10 dahllas one
hour--o if I weah one wrap aroun fo go rally make any kine noise? I no
mo one PhD, tita, but I can tink fo myself. You know aht, I get one
termometer get plenny degrees--I stick em up my ass when I staht fo tink
I know wassup fo somebody else.” Tony Quagliano read some poems about
nature. And Marie Hara read a poem about her daughter. All in all a good
evening.

Last night Albert Saijo read. When he said, “I AM AN ANIMAL IN A CAGE
AND I’M BARKING TO BE LET OUT” (that is from my notes; I don’t have the
book with me right now so don’t quote me on it), a woman in the audience
said “you go girl.” Albert Saijo is old and he hung out with the beats
and he lives in Volcano now. He doesn’t like computers and he likes the
muse. His book shows he is clearly a new Blake--kooky, visual, emphasis
on the rhapsodic. At his reading people were laughing really hard.
Especially when he read his poem that called for the eradication of
pain. His poems are written with different colored pencils in a distinct
scrawl (think Grenier here?). Bamboo Ridge, which just published his
book, has reproduced pages from the poems and then transcribed the poems
in all capitals. I think you should read this book also because it is a
good time.

Theodore Shockley should be William Shockley. Theodore Shackley is a
long time CIA operative. Mark: MD's are trained in the scientific method
and as Elder Olson points out "Agreement on method [in a science] is
such that, in any subject, method is spoken of in the singular rather
than in the plural." F.A Hayek, one of the intellectual gurus of neocon
thought, in his Counter-Revolutions of Science comes out strongly
against the mathematization and quantification of culture. He exempts
two elements, the hard sciences as opposed to the social sciences and
capitalism. Your position is in perfect alignment with Hayek's and
Sokal's and the intentions and actions of the heirs of Hayek's agenda
are well publicized. Congratulations. ---Carlo Parcelli

Wow! Perfect alignment! Better check my horoscope.

It's odd how little anguish I feel about incomprehensible accusations.
I, myself, I should warn you, was a CIA elder before they detribalized the
agency. Ted was our shaman, but some of us thought even then that he was a
bit of a neo-con man. In those days we hadn't learned to count our toes,
and some of the estimates were pretty wild. We hadn't discovered metric feet.
It was a confusing time, but we had great parties. Sometimes we went around
beating up satirists. Hell, when we were on the street even a little irony
was dangerous. Now that we've decided to take over the world, however,
excessive earnestness and claims of purity draw our attention. Might pay to
lock your door.
