Jeffrey Jullich <JJULLICH@CLAVEN.GSB.COLUMBIA.EDU> mentioned in his survey
of Scandanavian poetry the line

        "He offers a smile, mild
/ as pick-axe handles a / mile wide which kindles/ the hide of rutabegas"

As a long-time fan of John Ashbery, I'm a little concerned that the
spelling of

        rutabagas

is getting abraded here. We don't have them in Australia -- we have Swedes
and turnips, but not rutabagas -- but that's no reason to become careless
about our treasury of English spellings.

Anyone care to comment?
best,
        JT

Thanks to all for their book endorsements.  I'm 12 days away from a
deadline on a book and not focusing on much else right now, but know there
were a couple in these posts I haven't yet come across and want to, having
been asked to help jury a new book prize and wanting to cast as wide a net
as possible.  So in a couple weeks I'll be reaping the read from these
recos.  Alas all need to be dated 1999; anything noted 1998 in the front
pages won't work.

Anyone know the status of the newsprint <Countermeasures>?

For the second time in as many years, the weakness of the Boston Alternative
Poetry Conference lay, with a few significant exceptions, with the most
featured Boston poets.  This is more than, I think, simply the idiosyncrasies
or biases of my own taste.  I don't even mean to render a judgement
necessarily on the "value" of this work.  What I found disappointing though
was precisely the extent to which a lot of the featured Boston writers, both
younger & older, by reason of, for example, their relatively uncomplicated
adherence to mimetic and linear discourses, are "alternative" only in the
most problematic way--even given the slipperiness of the term.  This is
particularly evident of course when the New York poets come to town.
Whatever the virtues of Bill Corbett's or Gerrit Lansing's  work for
example--and there are many--there is no one with any clout on the Boston
scene about the age of the Language Poets who isn't still working very
clearly within the context of Modernist poetics--here, Black Mountain, the
predominant influence on the city's "alternative" poetry, didn't really lead
to anything  but the attempt to find a more "natural" language (Emerson's
influence as well?)--& this it seems to me is the most conservative spin one
could take on Olson's demand for linguistic reforms.  This missing generation
of experimentalist writers--so important, it seems to me, to the poetry
scenes in NY, LA, SF, & DC--is one of the principal causes of the
ambivalencies of Boston poetry.  It doesn't help either that Harvard & Boston
Universities are so unadventurous--you only have to look at what  Bob
Perelman's getting tenure at the University of PA has meant to the scene
there to see what a catalyzing (or inhibiting) role the universities can play
in the cultural life of a city.  Which is not to say that there is no
alternative to the Bost Alternative--Jack Kimball's EAST VILLAGE anthology
suggests that different emphases could have been made--but the absence of,
say, Lori Lubeski from the Conference is symptomatic of the general Boston
maliase.

My post was written in such haste, I just want to add that it might have been
unclear that I was speaking about the featured *Boston area poets*.  The term
"Boston poets" might seem to imply, erroneously that I was talking about all
of the poets who attended the *Boston* conference.

What if?  What if John Wieners were in a position to exert influence?  What
if Clark Coolidge had lived in Boston & not western MA?  What if Michael
Gizzi taught here? . . .

The collected poems of J.H. Prynne (Bloodaxe) is one of this year's major
poetry events. I got my copy thru amzon's uk website & in under a week.
Atalst, US readers will get a chance to discover this important poet.

Galassi's translations of Montale (FS&G) may finally bring this poet to
wider english language. Not sure what the vant-garde has against this guy
(re: a thread here of a few months back), but this book launched me on a
montale kick of thelast few months.



don't have the title handy, but the selected shorter poems of Ted Enslinn
(NPF) puts this usually very long-winded poet in a much better light, as he
is the master of the short lyric.

Joan,

This take on Plath's life is contrary to any I've seen before.  From
what I read she tried to live the life of the perfect 50s
woman--emphasis on the word perfect.  Much of what I find interesting
about her is the tension between the banality of her surface good
girlness and the turmoil and upheaval in the work.  Honesty in
personal relations???  I see her with the stretched smile of Patty
MacCormick in The Bad Seed (whom I recently saw interviewed live on
stage at the Castro Theater).

What I'm Doing About It


As September-February virtual writer-in-residence at trAce I'm supposed to
be preparing for incoming. Meanwhile we were three months away from desk-
tops, and the laptops can't handle the Linux system I need. So I bought a
Compaq 5204 only to find the sound gone on the system, which is now being
subject to a quick restore, thanks to Compaq help; the problem remains
which means that hardware's got to be changed. I've already spent an even-
ing when I should be learning cgi-bin stuff playing around with drivers
that I shouldn't have had to touch; I'd already tweaked the Win98 registry
and added a swapfile, etc., and that only took three days. I find myself
caught on slow modems when anything does work (and why is the QuickRestore
disk adding Windows NT setup at the moment? why does it give copying data
and current process percentages without giving the process name and the
time left for restoration?). I'm replete with gremlins; in the cgi-bin, I
used a script that runs on everything else (not my own), thanks to Paula
Edmiston who sent me the URLs; I then set permissions and paths properly
and I can pretend to add to hypertext to no avail. It's hot here but at
least the computers (this older Pentium 100 and the Compaq which runs at
330 with a different chip) are cooled over by the window. I'm desperate
for rain. I'm not made for file permissions and drivers and tech support
which isn't life support. I'm panicky about the residency, feeling very
unprepared - not enough perl, not enough javascript, only the blurred edg-
es of a story and what about those email lists? - I'm run ragged at the
precipice lip, out of money for further equipment (I'd give a lot if I had
it for a Toshiba Libretto fit out with RedHat 6.1 - _that_ would be ideal)
and out of sorts as "SystemSave" keeps running to my right - all of my own
data and tweaking having been erased of course. Well, this has all come to
an end with the QuickRestore and sure enough the sound is still bad and I
call up support again and tech tells me I have to bring it in to a certi-
fied dealer - well, first he's (the first tech was she's) got me going
into safe mode and removing the sound card and of course that's not it,
and then I hang up and check the warranty and it says I get on-site ser-
vice and I call tech support for the third time after calling the Compaq
main office at 2 in the morning and how dare they remain closed when I'M
calling, and anyway, the third guy agrees to the terms, gives me a case
number (now I'm official, I'm a case - this is the third case I've had
with Compaq mind you in three years, the other two ending in a class ac-
tion lawsuit), so within 3 to 5 days I can presumably start setting up
RedHat Linux 6.1 (if I can find it cheap enough) on the system (I've never
used lilo for booting, just System Commander), and and and and and

the whole world is beginning to feel like one big kludge, I shouldn't be
the virtual-writer-in-residence, I can hardly spell my name at the moment,
my work is all one big lie, the center doesn't hold and either do the
edges and for that matter nothing in particular holds anywhere across the
middle either, and I think

that all of human history is one big kludge, bumbling around, it's amazing
if the keyboard works (even if it's not connected to anything, I have one
of those Microsoft contoured ones and it feels great, but the system's
shut down until the repairs are done), it's amazing if the mouth works, if
speech works, in the long run into that dark dark night as Fitzgerald
might say, there's no one to call, no one to pick up the phone, no machine
to take the messages, no machine to deliver them, there's only that si-
lence on the line, there are no lines, there are no phones, no ears to
hear no mouths to speak of, and I think

thank god we're all fools looking down at our feet, I wonder if I can do
anything with this semi-broken RedHat Linux 5.0 on the other machine, so
what if the cgi-bin doesn't work, the colors aren't proper, and it won't
go into SVGA mode, keeping me in a ridiculous 640 by 480 or some such with
Netscape Communicator not even staying properly within X-Window coordin-
ates, but flooding all over multiple desktops, making me jumpy when I'm
working, just another kludge, I look into the mirror

and see parts and parts and parts, nothing whole, just assemblages linked
together, it's psychosis that makes me think they're only concatenated,
coupled, broken, ready to collapse at any moment, whole worlds are held
together

by tethers like that, this, the other, just as the parts of me beg for
different names

Hi Jordan,

Yes, of course Debbie does that very much.  What interests me about Moxley
is that she's trying to sneak in much of this artifice and sensibility that
is "anachronistic" as being very much a mark of "sincerity," or that she's
not quite foregrounding her artifice the way Robertson does, nor does she
engage in that hyperbolic rhetoric that just drenches Debbie in soap-box
irony (meaning that irony whose "message" outweighs its levity).  (She did
more in her first book, but not in the new chappy.)  Debbie could be said
to be a safer work, I think, due to its density and ideological surety -- I
mean the means of reception are in place for a book like that, and the
influences leading up to it are more or less respected when they're not
totally obscure -- whereas I think the Moxley chapbook -- what's it called
now, something Life -- attempts a sort of monumentality unhindered by this
(debilitating?) irony, for better or worse (worse when it is poorly
imitated, as she is destined to be), and freely accesses certain traditions
and modes that are not quite in the ascendant, and these sorts of gesture
could sink it for many, though on the other hand haven't and probably
won't.  This isn't to put Debbie on the lower end of some sort of critical
totem pole -- it's incredibly smart and wicked like most of Robertson's
work -- just in this particular light Moxley's poetry comes out as the more
unusual even if in the end it's strangeness is the free use of convention.

Another way  to look at it: you can't get excited about Moxley's work the
way you would about a traditionally "new" sort of avant-garde poetry, since
she's not avant-garde or new.  And yet there's something there turning many
of these value systems on their heads, and she fits in no obvious way into
the underground traditions that we are familiar with.  But then one asks
how she fits in with say a Bishop or say the "mainstream" of today?  I
think she's at a distance from them precisely because of this use of
"anachronistic" technique.  Yes, my dear Watson.

Make sense?  Well, must runn....
Brian

This month, Abiodun Oyewole talks about his poem "Black Rage," published
in the book *On a Mission: The Last Poets.* He discusses his role as both
spokesperson and poet, and offers suggestions on how to conceive of and
include political content in poetry. He also talks about the relationship
between rap/hip-hop and poetry, and suggests ways to think about rhythm in
poetry apart from rhyme.

Abiodun is an original member of The Last Poets, who perform nationwide
year-round. The Last Poets were born on May 19, 1968, at a birthday
celebration for Malcolm X. A group of three poets and a drummer, they
became the revolutionary voice for many African Americans, expressing the
plight of Black people in their music.

If you have about 6 minutes, you can download a file of Abiodun's reading
of "Black Rage."

John Solt's study of the poetry, poetics and life of Kitasono Katue
(1902--1978) has my vote for one of the top books of 1999.  Available from
Harvard University Press, Shredding the Tapestry of Meaning traces the
parallel development of modern and postmodernist poetry in Japan by
concentrating on one of the key players in its creation and dissemination.
"Kit Kat" as he was called by Pound and Williams, worked in an astonishing
variety of genres.  Of special interest are his contributions to dada, and
his invention of what he called "the plastic poem."  Katue also formed the
influential Vou group, from which other important Japanese poets like
Shuntaro Tanigawa and Kazuko Shiraisi emerged.  ISBN: 0-674-80733-2

Glass Beret, a sampling of Katue's poems, translated by Solt and Hashimoto
Akio, is available from Morgan Press.      ISBN: 1-880723-05-0

Subject:      Re: Boston 99
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Jacques,

What is the Boston Alternative Poetry Conference? If I had a hand in
organizing it (and I did not) I would have amended the title to something
like "Boston Poetry Weekend." It's not really a conference, it's a marathon
of poetry readings. Alternative is just a strange word to have in
there-alternative to what? There's nothing remotely like it in Boston and
its composition of readers is not exclusively "alternative" as jargon
fetishists and fellow-travelers understand the term in the context of
contemporary poetry.

Regardless, it's called the Boston Alternative Poetry Conference and it was
founded by a very energetic man by the name of Aaron Kiely.

Kiely has done something unique in Boston. It's probably unique anywhere.
With no academic credentials, no university or foundation support, etc.,
practically no money, etc. Kiely brings poets to Boston from all over the
States to read their work or give a presentation. Most poets are not paid,
but some have their airfare paid by Aaron-out of his own pocket I suspect.
I do know that his pockets are not very deep.

Anyway, the basis of the first half of your complaint-post (Boston poets
make for weak conference) is pretty petty.

But it's the second part of your post that is intriguing. Not to mention
your second post, "what if?" "what if?"

You think the components of the poetry world (i.e., poets) can be sorted
like screws into boxes of those whose work/projects you approve of, and
those who you don't.

Well this is fine with me. I have those boxes too.

But there are further belief systems indicated in your post that amaze me,
as well as amuse me:

1) that there are poets "on the scene" in Boston (or anywhere really) who
have "clout"

[Note-I don't think you're talking about the people who run reading series
and draw up invitation lists to the right parties. You mean their poetry,
don't you? As if significant influences in one's work will come from closer
zip codes. I mean your post assumes that everyone in Boston is reading each
other's work! Like, NYC right?]

2) the attempt to find a more "natural" language isn't or wasn't enough.
Been there, done that-let's move on

3) a more adventurous Harvard or BU or whatever U. may help remedy these
insufficiencies

4) there are generations of experimentalist writers (as there are
generations of Kennedys) and one is missing in Boston (not a pun)

5) Wieners, even in his current "position" is NOT exerting influence.
(This, of your assertions, is most wrong I think). Everyone in Boston has
been influenced by Wieners I think, tho few have ever met him. Of course,
he's Black Mountain.

6) there is such a thing as "Boston poetry" and it is ambivalent

{Here I insert that I did help Jack Kimball co-ordinate a special edition
of The East Village Poetry Web Site (Vol. 7) that focused on poetry and
visual art in and around the Boston area. However, our work there distanced
itself from the idea that there was aesthetic cohesion in Boston poets,
whereas Jacques is implying (to my ear) that could be cohesion to
everyone's benefit.]

7) that a well-placed Coolidge or Gizzi could make things right (see #3) in
Beantown. None I am aware of listen to professors in the area now; not
Corbett, not you. How would things be different with different people?

You imply Coolidge and Gizzi are not read in Boston with pleasure as well
as profit.

all best,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, 02/08/99
Telepoetics Beach Party: Vancouver and San Antonio, Texas
September 6, 1999, West Spanish Banks Beach
9pm PST (11pm CST)

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre

PRESENTS
TELEPOETICS
AT THE BEACH

LABOUR DAY PICNIC AND LONE STAR LINK-UP
LIVE FROM WEST SPANISH BANKS (near the anchor)

featuring improv poetry ensemble Verbomotorhead and Susan
Mullen, from Vancouver; and poetry-percussion performance
artist, Mim Sharlack, Trinidad Sanchez, and more-from San
Antonio, Texas.

On Monday, September 6 join us for our end of summer picnic
bash. The poetry reading starts at 9pm but come down early
to enjoy roving musicians and the sunset. Bring your own
food, blankies, chairs and beverages—the entertainment is on
us.

Verbomotorhead (Alex Ferguson, Kedrick James, Mark Plimley,
and Doni Scob) is an oral poetry performance group that does
improv poetry and polyvocal acapella arrangements.

Susan Mullen (S.R.-H) has been writing poetry since 1964 and
lives here in Vancouver where she is host of the open mike
series “Tales of Ordinary Madness” and is co-organizer of
the new Pan Poetics reading series at the Helen Pitt
Gallery.

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre uses digital videophones to
exchange poetry between Vancouver and other locales. Always
facing the challenge of the marriage between art and
technology, this is the first outdoor link we’ve planned.

“This linkup is extremely ambitious for two reasons—new
partner and because we're doing it outside. But like
Symphony of Fire, we’re using the night sky for a backdrop.”
(President of EEC, Heather Haley).

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre is a nonprofit society whose
mandate is to exploit communications technology to widen the
audience of Canadian poetry and to give poets, multi-media
artists and youth the opportunity to use, learn, and create
with this technology. Videoconferencing and online
publishing are the major technologies that we work with. Our
electronic magazine can be viewed and heard at
<www.edgewisecafe.org>. Poets featured with audio include
Adeena Karasick, Wayde Compton, bill bissett and Sheri-D
Wilson. We also publish videopoems and are hosting Canada’s
first Videopoem Festival at Video In Studios this fall.

For more information, please call Carol L. Hamshaw,
Administrator, at 904-9362/984-1712.

For those with realaudio and an interest in that which has come to be known
under the somewhat innocuous rubric of world music, check out
www.worldmusicradio.org. I'll be doing a program from 6-9pm (Pacific time)
on Mondays, 8-midnight (Pacific time) Saturdays. Mostly music from Africa,
the middle-east, the caribbean, and America (jazz and new music). Not alot
of poetry in the strictest sense, although I did tonight play two cante
jondo renditions of Lorca poems and a piece of Pierre Akendengue's (he's a
poet/musician from Gabon).

Who were the "significant (Boston-based) exceptions" - and what made them
either &/or both?  What New York poets are you referring to as having "come
to town"?  I mean, wch ones, who's who, how do they come to be so
characterized?

What do you make of the likes of Richard Dillon or Michael Basinski, Alan
Gilbert and Wil Alexander, or an extensive list of others present at the
conference that don't seem to fall under either a New York or Boston (Black
Mountain based) heading?  Perhaps the real substance of such a conference is
less in the featured readers - who are for reasons of reputation often
included in a program to attract the "wider audience" - and more in the work
presented by lesser knowns in ways more "on the ground," the efforts of
those more one's peers.  In that light, there is perhaps reason to doubt the
catalyzing influence of a "leading light," since a momentum would have had
to be present in those catalyzed to begin with.  The audience in Boston,

so it was reported to me, since I missed the Saturday evening events, was
"galvanized" by Gerrit Lansing's reading.  I think in terms of immediate
influence, this is as good as things get; institutionalizing this energy in
terms of "a program," be it anti- pro- proto- neo ANYthing, tends to put an
end to the ambiguousness at its outset, in many ways also its source.
Better, I think, to have HAD

a "slippery" conference, direction undefined, only partly differentiated,
but still, plenty of direction in any direction THERE.

Gerald Schwartz --

You asked us to share impressions of the Boston Conference.

"...Once was a mermaid martyred ashore
She stood half humanly on her soft white feet
And sang tenaciously
There
In as many lines as it often takes, a story has emerged..."

And there Lyn Hejinian concluded and, along with Tina Darragh and John Wieners, stole
the show.

High highlights: Wieners' reading older, lyrically cohesive poetry that was ignored, in
fact incomprehensible to most 20 years ago -- worth the price of admission this summer
day; Tina Darragh and Lyn Hejinian demonstrating in two distinct directions how
personable 'lang' gets -- committed as ever to messaging beyond tight, wiry surfaces
that craft, postlang, clearly necessitates; Wendy Kramer's spiff amalgam of
communitarian cum postCagey "performative"; Lewis Warsh, hardly winding down on his
life's project, lavish scrutiny of ... is it male intimacy? Michael Gizzi libretto-ing
from _No Both_ and _Too Much Johnson_ from which emerge these lines in "Mr. America's
Dehydrated Nightjar":

"...you want an equation very well
we grew up crazy for kneeslaps and
paperweights featuring snowflakes
we've a great infection to
serve many Jasons to come..."

I'll be running out of post space, but there were Chris Stroffolino who read as much
apres-Ashbery as Gizzi, less Annandale-on-the-Hudson, though, mean (and proud of it);
Maggie Zurawski, whose poems are just so surgical and Moneyline I want to die in her
arms; CD Wright going on in the finest drawls from _Deepstep Come Shining_:

"...Hog Waste Lagoon is overflowing. _From the west down to
the east._

What an onion. They're Vidalias. Now do you know where
we are.

Did you ask the taxidermist about the eyes. [...] [Emphasis in original.] ["Now do you
know where we are" serves as a refrain, bigger and bigger laughs, yucks, etc.]

Peter Ganick read to his mock max by timing blocks of silence between blocks of
three-line verse:

"...nothing nnootthhiinngg perhaps wordperfect
a sitcom a voice wooden inhaled response decked
on bathroom floor worries you away hello

Equal time, that is, text and silence. Fortissimo. Also very fortissimo, Anselm
Berrigan with throw-away lines like: "Poppa my pod fell apart"; "Consider yr medicated
acquaintances / as offering you a crash course in diplomacy"; and as a kind
meta-comment to Conference admin, "Caveman! Schedule yr / readers appropriately."

Aside, for a sec, on group readings -- The Bronk was cancelled because I was the only
one left standing, armed and ready to read my man. And just a whiff of agreement here
with Jacques Debrot about the conservative undercurrents that prop up the shiny new
atmosphere: in contrast to Bronk, droves of us lined up to read Emily Dickinson (whose
also my man).  I read her in Japanese and a couple of other languages (prompting the
Boston-based group organizer to leave the room).  Drew Gardner read her, impressively,
from memory. Chris Stroffolino read her the loudest, and made her sound, well,
contemporary.  The O'Hara group reading was lots of fun (no kidding), but I was
surprised how we all avoided the really famous poems that need _lots_ of
i-n-f-l-e-c-t-i-o-n. Lots of white guys, most passing themselves off as unqueer, and a
sonic Anne Waldman.

Then -- back to origninal poetry -- later the same day of the O'Hara group fest, there
was a pile of truth-telling about marriage by Anne; words like 'towels' and 'twos' came
up a lot. Kristin Prevallet blew us away topically or perhaps faux-topically,
juxtaposing sad / bad realia blurbs from the oddest array of American daily newspapers.
I was running in and out of the gruesome classroom where everyone had to read while
Drew Gardner, Patrick Doud, and Alan Gilbert held forth, but the scuttlebutt was
awfully positive. And badly-scheduled performances [read 'early a.m.'] veiled great
stuff from Jacques Debrot, Doug Rothschild, Brendan Lorber, Barbara Freeman, Prageeta
Sharma, Heather Scott Peterson. But I'll be putting up videos and text from most of
these readings over the next few volumes of The East Village, so nothing's lost!

And, I forgot to mention Jim Behrle, a Boston poet who has lots of guts [read
'heartfelt']; Michael Basinski, straightman to his own wondrous ad libs nosed against
his faked mistranslations of a language-toy palimpsest; smiling Jordan Davis reading
too short a time for optimum dream affect (style query: if Jordan moussed his hair
back, would his poems brood?); Forrest Gander reading beautifully from a new work in
English and Spanish.  I'm leaving a few friends and me out. Maria Damon read an
in-progress, "Something about Bob Kaufman and the Poet's Labor," fabulously provocative
in that form, I thought. Lots of fact-checking -- Kaufman's and, who knows, his
father's work habits may figure into this  - surely leftwing but not a bit preachy.

Jeffrey Jullich <JJULLICH@CLAVEN.GSB.COLUMBIA.EDU> mentioned in his survey
of Scandanavian poetry the line

         "He offers a smile, mild
/ as pick-axe handles a / mile wide which kindles/ the hide of rutabegas"

As a long-time fan of John Ashbery, I'm a little concerned that the
spelling of

         rutabagas

is getting abraded here. We don't have them in Australia -- we have Swedes
and turnips, but not rutabagas -- but that's no reason to become careless
about our treasury of English spellings.

Anyone care to comment?
best,
         JT

Rutabagas?  Vegetables?  Spellings?  Mr. Zappa had something to say on the
subject, not only about rutabagas, but all vegetables and green things in
general. . .

Call any vegetable Call it by name
Call one today When you get off the train
Call any vegetable And the chances are good
The vegetable will respond to you
(Some people don't go for prunes...I
don't know, I've always found that if they...)
Call any vegetable Pick up your phone
Think of a vegetable Lonely at home
Call any vegetable And the chances are good
That a vegetable will *respond* to you

Rutabaga, Rutabaga,
Rutabaga, Rutabaga, Rutabay-y-y-y...

(A prune isn't really a vegetable...
CABBAGE is a vegetable...)
No one will know
If you don't want to let them know
No one will know
'Less it's you that might tell them so
Call and they'll come to you
Covered with dew,
Vegetables dream, Vegetables dream,
Vegetables dream Of responding to you
Standing there shiny and proud by your side
Holding your hand while the neighbors decide
Why is a vegetable something to hide?
A lot of people don't bother about their
friends in the vegetable kingdom. They
think: Oh, ah, what can I say? What can
a person like myself say to a vegetable?
But the answer is simple, my friends:
Just call, and tell them how you feel
about muffins...pumpkins...wax
paper...Caledonia, Mahoganies, elbows ...
green things in general...and
soon, a new rapport...you and your
new little green and yellow buddies,
grooving together...Oh, no! Maintaining
your coolness together! Worshipping
together in the church of your
choice...(only in America...)

"Call Any Vegetable" by Frank Zappa.

No harm intended here about the spectrum of issues involved at the
intersection of spellings and vegetables.

Dodie,

"The Bad Seed!" Yes, yes. What a movie. You reminded me I want to see that
one again. :-) As far as Plath's 50's style "surface good girlness"--I don't
think that was what she was striving to create or maintain at all, at least
in her mature years. Even in her college years, there was a terrible sense
of "phoniness" that she strove to overcome in her relationships. "The Bell
Jar," while not a memoir, still gives insight into some of this striving.
The common wisdom about her--that she was a creative daemon who wanted more
than anything to stay boxed up in a plaid-pleated skirt and peter-pan
collar, presenting a good-girl facade to the world--doesn't gibe with her
own letters or reported comments from friends and family. I recently read
"Bitter Fame" (Stevenson) and was struck for the first time by her intense
and continuous striving to weld together the world of imagination and the
world of reality. I believe she was being driven more by a drive to be
whole, than a drive to destroy anything. Relationships of all kinds are
described very vividly in this biography, and she seemed nearly incapable of
having a "dishonest" one--placing a terrible burden on even such mundane
activities as having tea with a neighbor.  Stevenson gives some very
detailed and telling reports of these "social" interactions. Plath is not
someone you would want to invite for a little tea and small talk. You gain a
lot of sympathy for Ted Hughes from these accounts--I mean, she burned up
this man's own poetry, not once but twice. The deterioration of her marriage
is one harrowing episode after another, and, like many other people who
experience such a personal holocaust, she didn't recover. However, it wasn't
for lack of honesty.

One of her lines: "Perfection is terrible, it cannot have children" is a
significant comment on her own life. Though, I don't believe this
"perfection" she strove for was the "life of the perfect 50's woman" as you
put it. Instead, the perfection sought seems to have been one of a meshed
universe, where the emotional reality of the poem and the reality it springs
from are one. A terrible perfection indeed.

RE Jacques comments on the BoPofest....

         anyone who had the privilege of experiencing Gerrit Lansing's Sat
night reading at the Boston ALT PO FEST heard nothing less than the full
breath of what ever it is that Poetry can be: There was new work that moved
Gerrit's body of work wonderfully forward into a Future  & at the same time
turned back to redefine the previous poems from THE HEAVENLY TREE even as he
read them. Each vowel  each syllable  each intake of breath  released each
Word into a meandering song that rose up into a marvelous chorus of
Language....

... it was simply one of the most moving & Masterful readings I have
experienced in thirty years. . .

& This was followed by Wiener's rising to read & remarking ryely under his
breath:
      "its wonderful to see that Mr. Lansing's poetry has continued to
develop over the years" [please add good boston accent]
 before nailing us with several tender moments of his own

You write:

 "What if John Wieners were in a position to exert influence?"

"there is no one with any clout "

"where was Lori Lubeski"


if anything defines the scene here it is a flat rejection of that notion of
Clout & influence-
we leave the Quest for such clout to the UNIversity boys & girls who are
spending their time desperately searching for power and jobs so that they can
then influence people with their clout, rather than setting out on the
Journey that poetry is.

the rest of us here are simply at home making our work and our lives.

As for the "alternative" terminology it has been tossed around & poked by all
of us even Aaron Kiely who coined it & all are aware that it has thorns
everywhere.

the fact is that the work being done by those poets and others associated
with LIFT or Word of Mouth (a rather broad canvas) here in Boston  is
Traditional: & the standardized "epiphanal" verse of Ploughshares, Harvard
Review, Agni, etal as well as the desperate attempts (I am imagining Mike
Myers hyperactive child bouncing at the end of his school-yard tether here),
at an equally standardized experimental verse, are nothing more than
momentary, and anything BUT traditional.



*****........
Jacque: if I wanted to Read, in your fashion, your work... I could nail it as
somebody who had taken a decent look at Jess' TRICKY CAD (c1950's)  & not
much more...
Or I could enjoy the fact of someone taking up that work -to me a Vital task-
& seeing again if there is vitality there- seeing if you can do something
with it.....  I far prefer this reading.

******
"Modernist poetics--here, Black Mountain, the
predominant influence on the city's "alternative" poetry, didn't really lead
to anything  but the attempt to find a more "natural" language (Emerson's
influence as well?)--& this it seems to me is the most conservative spin one
could take on Olson's demand for linguistic reforms."

You need only to read Torra's GAS STATION & the go to his KEEP WATCHING to
understand that this is just not the case (& when his entire trilogy of which
GAS STATION is the first is finally out it will again open possibilities that
are far from your notion of Conservative.
or take Ed Barrett's work as another example or Ange Mlinko's new book

*****
there was ten years of Word of Mouth, four of Torra's lift  (which not only
frequently published Lori Lubeski's work by- the way  but devoted  a third of
an entire issue to her & deservedly). Mlinko's small run of COMPOUND EYE
Bouchard's MASS AVE... Corbett's FIRE EXIT before that ,which published Howe,
Cooledge, Palmer, Olson, Mayer etc. etc. etc. ) or Lansing's' SET the list
goes on & on
the point is, that for a large number of us it is not a "scene" a school,
clout or influence that we are working toward....all of that we can leave to
the second tear harvard professors.

we are working simply to Realize our work



what is here is a context
& that context ranges from Emerson or Whitman (who spent time here in
Somerville!) Dickinson, Olson, Blaser Lansing, Spicer (BPL) Corbett, the
Howes, Torra, Gizzi, Mlinko, Gander, Lubeski, Pruitt, Sawyer-Laucanno, Ed
Barrett, Bouchard, Lombardo,

this context does not raise and fall on a festival ....

& there were numerous good reads over the weekend by Bouchard, Lansing,
Barrett, Gander, Lease...to just throw up a few names & there was good work
from NY as well & Scalapino (Ca) & so on & there was a lot of the SOS which
is a surprise????


****
a festival is no more or less than a moment.... where we in our time -without
authorization- (who is Aaron Kiely..???) - come together & talk & read & eat
on monday we all go back to work.....
 some of us go back to school
the rest we can leave to the want-to-be biographers
or to the Chroniclers

there is no "general malaise" in Boston for anyone taking the time to explore
what has and continues to be going on here...

what you experience as malaise is our rejection of lame academic
short-sighted theorizing that has at its root nothing forwarding but simply
the attempt to commodify and authorize. this I find tremendously boring.

_

remember what Olson said

"Let those who use words cheap, who use us cheap
take themselves out of the way
Let them not talk of what is good for the City

or
Mr. Torra:

 There is an inward division of selves, among place. Laced tortoise-shelled
markings.Each morning the corral of good night's rest. We own more verbs than
space, which some say attributes unequal growth and desensitizing effect
which activates when the climate is right and too much yeast is added. What
this illustrates I know. Wrench expression. Break mask. Ferret underground
past.


&so to close:
now may we all be united in this strange and inappropriate as we are told
Quest. do not but bend bow low sweep as some men and women do walk out
beneath a ryder moon in dream and take a broom to the sea.
in this life we swim and dream in air.
each stroke recurs or recurves in what we call beneath us. calls us to float
on. causation forms. geologic foundations or strewn terminals. remain.
moraine.  we walk amongst. pick a way through. united. rimmed




all best


Michael Franco


PS literally everybody I know has felt deeply the work of John Wieners...
editorial /or hiring & firing power or promises of Tenure do not an
influence make......

many of us who are listed under "not-Boston" have greater-bosstown roots.
Ammiel Alcalay, Lyn Hejinian, Jack Kimball, Andrew Schelling and I all
either grew up and/or attended school around there.  some of us stayed w/
family, and it was very touching, i thought, to see Lyn H's family (mother,
stepfather, sister, nephew) turn out to see her reading.

This is Bill Corbett being interviewed by Joseph Torra in the Bill Corbett
issue of LIFT magazine, April '94:

"This has never been  town, Joe, at least in my life here, that's been
congenial to alternative, experimental, whatever word you want to put on that
kind of poetry. I think Harvard, for instance, has been mainstream.  B.U. has
been mainstream.  This is not to deny the real talent of people who have
worked there.  It's simply to say, let's face it, the LANGUAGE project took
place somewhere else.  And this is not a negligible thing.  It's not a place
that's . . .  hospitable to a kind of poetry written in this country to the
wider range."

And so on.  I was actually surprised by this because I was a looking
specifically  for a quote of his just now in which I remembered him saying
something like everybody interesting eventually leaves Boston, & I find that
Corbett, of all people, had already said in essence what I was saying.

Dan Bouchard's, Michael Franco's, & Stephen Ellis's responses to my e-mail
are legitimate, however they completely miss the conjectural tone of my
remarks & the tentativeness with which I made my assertions.  I think it will
be clear if you read my post again that I didn't make the kind of derogatory
readings that Michael represents me as having made.  **In fact I didn't
mention anyone specifically** precisely because I didn't want to diss anyone
in public--not least because I am very much aware that my own tastes are
partial & biased just like everyone else's.  Despite his real
generosity--both personally, as you'll know if you've ever been a guest at
his home--& intellectually, Michael's characterization is an unfortunate
projection on his part & somewhat revealingly overstated given the
provocation.   In fact, as I conceded in my original post, there **are many
kinds of excellencies in poetry**, & adjectives  like "alternative" have a
way of becoming fetishized.  I wanted instead to attempt to account for why
there isn't a scene here that *I*fit into--whatever the merits of that scene
would be-- so that, far from advocating anything like, what Dan Bouchard
calls, "aesthetic cohesion"--I am interested to know the reasons--as Corbett
himself says-- for the narrow range of poetries in Boston.  My point wasn't
that there are too many Michael Francos, but not enough of other kinds of
things.  Dan's remarks would have been more persuasive if he hadn't come on
like a counsel for the defense.  But do you really mean, Dan, to assert that
there is *no* element of truth in what I was saying?

It is somewhat symptomatic of the scene here that the mildest criticism leads
to a circling of the wagons.   In addition to Michael's & Dan's very fair,
though I believe mistaken remarks, I have unfortunately already received this
afternoon 2 obscenity-riddled messages on my answering machine in response to
my post.  In a small place like this, it is very easy to identify one's own
self-interests with the interests of poetry-at-large & to see any demurral at
all as dangerous & badly motivated.  There is room for disagreement & I would
be very interested to hear someone take up Bill Corbett's remarks & interpret
them in a more generous light to Boston than I have done.

(my apologies to anyone who receives this twice)

For better or worse, Duration Press & Duration online is, hopefully,
ready to launch its new Small Press Publications Announcements
Page.Hopefully this is something can I can make run as smoothly as
possible, & for as long as possible. If you would like your new (or
recent—I figure anything published within the past few months is fair
game) publications listed, please send me, in the body of an e-mail,
the following information (in this order, please, please, please):

Publisher Name
Title(s) information
Ordering information
Publisher contact information, including e-mail address, mailing
address, website (if applicable)

For title blurbs, please keep them to a reasonable length.

How it will all work:

This list will be a single page at the Duration Press site
( http://members.xoom.com/Duration/durationhome.html (soon to be
durationpress.com)) & will be updated every two weeks. The deadline
for new lists, as they appear, will be every other Friday at midnight
Pacific time. The new list will be posted every other Saturday night.
As such, I will be collecting information from publishers during that
two week period. As each new list is posted, the old one will be added
to a dated archive. So, in a sense, this will be a way to construct a
bibliography in process of Small Press Publications. Perhaps, in the
future, I will start to work on a bibliography for Small Press
Publications starting in 1980 (beginning where Steven Clay's _A Secret
Location on the Lower East Side left off)...so everyone be prepared to
dig through your piles of books. But that won't be for a
while...depends on how
crazy I want to make myself.

I am going to be collecting material for the first list for the next
week & a half, with the first list being posted on August 14th, so if
anyone knows anyone who may want their
publications listed, please pass along this info to them.

Anyway, I do hope that everyone out there will be willing to
participate on a regular basis, & I am sure that new presses will be
added continually. We will just have to see how it all goes.

All my best,

Jerrold Shiroma

I am glad to read yesterday's responses to Jacques Debrot's comments on
the Boston Alternative Poetry Conference.  Here is another one that
didn't get out in time.

While I do understand that a thing really OUGHT to be what
it calls itself, the issue of whether participants (local or not) in the
conference were "alternative" enough, depends, of course, on how we
define "alternative."  Aaron Kiely, the conference's creator and guiding
spirit, addressed this very issue in his closing remarks.  I will not
presume to
quote him directly  here, but my sense was that he too
was questioning the word "alternative" in the conference title, and
wanted to assure everyone that participants were, to his mind, not
"alternative" as in "other", but simply vibrant writers, devoted to a
variety of
approaches, who are writing in the NOW.  That is a paraphrase to be
sure. To separate the individual words of the conference's title (Were
the
writers alternative?  Were they truly "Boston"?  Was all of it poetry?)
seems to me to cloud the reality of that gathering of writers of poetry
and fans of poetry--poetry in all its living incarnations.

I think that what was "alternative" was the incredible SPIRIT of the
conference, much of which was inspired by Mr. Kiely, a young poet who
has managed, two years in a row, on astonishing good will and a budget
as small as a sand flea, to entice writers of both reputation and
promise and listeners of a discerning and appreciative consciousness to
come
together and celebrate the work itself and the self-generating community
that formed almost effortlessly for those three marathon reading days.
This overarching spirit WAS the weekend--instead of  the sometimes
daunting (or at best irritating) academic/poetic/competitive barriers
that conferences--and even individual literary events--often
produce.

All I am saying is that if the word "alternative" is a problem, it is
(oh no!!) ONLY A WORD.  When something this good happens, I'm amazed to
see
anyone focus on a small negatives.  I'm sure there was no deliberate
false
advertising to those who truly seek alternatives.  Perhaps what's needed
is a
conference title that embraces the "radiant pluralism" that David
Shapiro spoke of
in his fascinating and entertaining talk.  "The Boston Pluralistic
Poetry
Conference" might be closer to what happened.  Or maybe the Alternative
Boston Poetry Conference--meaning an alternative type of conference--one
that would embrace many "types" of poetry.

I do understand that those who wanted every reader to be as
"alternative" as, say, Wendy Kramer and her wonderful corrugated love
poems, might
have been sometimes disappointed.  But personally I would welcome more
alternative/pluralistic/open-minded/inclusive poetry events at any time,
anywhere.

Dear Jacques Debrot, congratulations on posing so many complicated
questions all in one post and for provoking all of us into thinking
about so many different issues.  I can't respond very fully to any of
your points but can speak only briefly now.  Daniel Bouchard has
wisely printed a list of Boston poets attending said Conference and a
second list of poets from elsewhere that also attended, made it
concrete and plain, and frankly speaking as an outsider I wonder how
the New York poets in attendance come off as so much more
sophisticated and/or accomplished and/or experimental than the Boston
ones.  Please clarify.

In the matter of a "missing generation" doesn't Boston have a very
good parallel in the case of Vancouver where, just as you claim
happened in Boston, most of the older poets "with clout" were working
in "adherence to mimetic and linear discourses," "clearly within the
context of Modernist poetics."  And then despite the missingness, the
absence of the important generation, Vancouver yet transformed itself
into a veritable capital of Language writing.  Perhaps in searching
for reasons for the "ambivalencies" of Boston poetry you are looking
too hard for something that's NOT not there.

I'm also not sure what role Lori Lubeski is playing in your argument,
is she an example of an important (perhaps older?) (or younger?)
experimental voice ignored or squelched or "disappeared" by
organizers of Conference?

I know it's difficult in a public space to bring up these issues,
particularly of malaise.  So, good for you.  But isn't poetry
everywhere, at every time, in malaise and must continually be
recuperated and rescued?  Are you a Bostonian yourself?  You should
come to San Francisco where, despite the presence among us of even
the missing generation, six or seven or eight generations are all
working at once and still feeling a little hung over and millennial
right now.

Subject:      LIGHT IN AUGUST at ZINC BAR
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

That's right, the Zinc Bar  Sunday Night Reading Series will be a little
light this August.  Are the Zinc Brothers getting lazy?  Just the opposite
actually.  There are five Sundays in August which means, at two poets a
night, ten readers altogether.   The problem?  Only seven or eight poets
crazy enough to stick around New York this month. So by skipping a couple
of Sundays, we're actually saving one or two poets for the audience.

With the assistance of Ms. Weimerskirch & Mr. Rakotoniaina however, we have
more letters in this line-up than in any other.  Dig this e-z guide to
AUGUST AT THE ZINC BAR and see what we're talking about.

SUNDAY AUGUST 1:   reading? I don't think so
SUNDAY AUGUST 8: BILL LUOMA & JULIANA SPAHR
SUNDAY AUGUST 15: DAVID STACK & RACHEL WEIMERSKIRCH
SUNDAY AUGUST 22: JACK KIMBALL reads, NADA GORDON sings & JEAN-CLAUDE
RAKOTONIAINA also sings
SUNDAY AUGUST 29: what part of no reading don't you understand?

Join your hosts Douglas Rothschild & Brendan Lorber here at the Zinc Bar,
why don't you.  Bill Luoma & Juliana Spahr come to us direct from Dole
Street, Honolulu which is the least of many compelling reasons to catch
their rare appearance.  Jack Kimball & Nada Gordon just jetted in from
Tokyo.  Jean-Claude Rakotoniaina, from Madagascar, is our bartender, and
thus has attended more events at the Zinc Bar than everyone else combined.
The issue arises of course, who'll be pouring drinks while Jean-Claude is
singing?

Also, be sure to mark your calendars for Sunday September 12 -- the season
premiere of the Zinc Bar Sunday Night 1999-2000 series.  On that evening we
invite audience members & previous readers to exact revenge on the hosts by
introducing Brendan & Douglas themselves.  If there's time left over, B&D
will read their own work.

The Zinc Bar is located in New York at 90 West Houston Street between
LaGuardia and Thompson Streets and on the periodic table between cadmium &
lead.

The readings begin at 6:37pm and they continue to whirl unstoppable -- like
the steel blades of the Zinc's new Cinni fans -- until they decide to call
it quits.   The Cinni fans augment the air conditioning and replace last
week's failed cat-mounted rotors experiment.

There is a $3 donation which goes to the readers & to the veterinarian
bills.  If you don't have the money you can pay whatever seems okay to you.
Just remember that if you pay less that $1.50 the poets might not have
cash for the subway &'ll have to follow you around all night.

Need more information or someone to talk to?  Call the Zinc Bar Information
Crisis Hotline at 212.533.9317 or 212.366.2091

Please note: No cats were actually injured in the creation of this email or
the curation of the Zinc Bar Sunday Night Reading Series.

On behalf of Douglas & everyone at the Zinc Bar I remain steadfastly,
Brendan Lorber.
Good night

This is a poem about language
(august, hospitable egomania):
a beauteous, gloating mishap.

"Manageable utopia sought." Is
this a poem? Language is about
tautologies, an "I AM" bush. Page

gaps. The ambitious analogue.
Stage phobia, mutual agonies:
"Situation Omega! Plague!" (Bash!)

An ultimate big oesophagus, a
biasing gaol-house. Amputate
sub-human. Apologise. Agitate.

I, alphabet - I, nauseous maggot,
inestimable - oughta go up as a
gaseous, glum ape-habitation.

Top Iraqi poet al-Bayati dies in Syria August 3, 1999

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Abdel Wahab al-Bayati, the renowned Iraqi
poet who spent half his life in exile, died Tuesday of a heart attack
in Damascus. He was 73.

The official Syrian Arab News Agency, which reported his death, gave no
further details, but friends said he was taken to hospital to be treated
for asthma.

Al-Bayati had lived in Damascus since 1996 after he left Jordan, where he
sought refuge after quitting his diplomatic post in Madrid, Spain, in
protest following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

In 1995, Saddam Hussein's government stripped him of his citizenship after
he visited Saudi Arabia to participate in a cultural festival.

Ali Oqala Orsan, head of the Syria-based Arab Writers Federation,
described al-Bayati as "a pioneer of Arab modern poetry."

"His body has gone but his soul will remain among us and his innovation
will continue to shine in our lives," Oqlan told The Associated Press by
telephone from Damascus.

Al-Bayati was one of the first Arab poets who broke away from classical
forms of poetry and started what later became known as free verse.

His first collection "Angels and Devils," which was published in Beirut
in 1950, and later the "Broken Jugs" were considered the real launch of
Arab poetry's modernist movement.

After his graduation from Baghdad University in 1950, al-Bayati became
a teacher but was soon dismissed for his leftist political opinions.

In 1954, he went into exile, first to Syria and then to the Soviet
Union and Egypt. He returned to Iraq after the 1958 anti- monarchy coup,
but later left following disagreements with the government.

He returned again after the 1968 coup but fled a few years later
when the regime began a brutal campaign against leftists. In 1980,
Saddam assigned him to Iraq's diplomatic mission in Madrid in an attempt
to win him over to his side.

Despite his anti-government stand, al-Bayati was never criticized
in Iraq's tightly-controlled official media and his books are sold in
Baghdad book shops.

Al-Bayati was born in a Baghdad neighborhood near the shrine of
the 12th century Sufi Abdel Qadir al-Jilani. Most of his poetry was
later influenced by Sufism.

In an interview with The Associated Press in 1997, al-Bayati described
his exile as a "tormenting experience" which affected his poetry and
writings.

"I always dream at night that I am in Iraq and hear its heart beating
and smell its fragrance carried by the wind, especially after midnight
when it's quiet."

He spent his last days with fellow Iraqi exiles in Damascus cafes,
reminiscing the days of peace and Iraq's leading role in Arabic poetry
and modern art, according to his family members.

Syrian officials said an official funeral will be held for al-Byati in
Damascus on Wednesday. They said his family has yet to to decide whether
he will buried in Syria or taken to Iraq.

Al-Bayati is survived by a wife and a daughter.

Rudy Burkhardt died on Sunday, drowning himself in a pond at his country
house in Vermont. Rudy was a filmaker and photographer, perhaps best known
for his now-classic shots of  New York's midtown area. In New York, he was
an active presence both for independent filmmakers and poets, attending
showings and readings. In fact, I last saw Rudy in June at Henry Hills's
show of new films and video at Anthology Film Archive. Indeed, Burckhardt's
films are among the great works of American independent cinema.

Rudy has a number of books, but I recommend most Mobile Homes, edited by
Kenward Elmslie and published by Elmslie's Z Press in 1979. The wry
autobigraphical commentary in the book is a talisman against both
sentimentality and earnestness.

Elements of truth perhaps. Many instances though flat wrong--an
uninfluential Wieners for example. And though I believe you when you say
you did not mean to badmouth specific people, some people are bound to read
it that way.

Anyway, Boston is certainly not San Francisco or NYC in terms of poetry
community. No one in Boston would try and claim otherwise. However, I think
you overestimate NYC. For sheer numbers of poets, yes it's bigger (and
bigger is probably better only if it's diverse. Is it diverse?
Fourth-generation NY school all sounds the same after two pages, and
second-rate Language poetry is worse.)

Boston is certainly on the same field as San Diego, LA, or DC, even if the
traditions being worked in Boston are not ones you particularly care for.
But this is a tally-sheet I don't care to keep. It's a hindrance.
Personally, my most vital community of poets begins in Honolulu and reaches
to Cambridge, UK. You can map it but it doesn't matter.
Alas, we do not meet for drinks often.

My disagreement with your first two posts on the subject were more about
your ideas of how community works, at least here, which is the one I am
involved in. But again, this is "my" disagreement. I am not presuming to
speak for any other poet in Boston.

The counsel for defense tone I cannot help. Rather, I prefer it,
considering the limitations of an e-mail forum. I certainly couldn't speak
in person in the list-mode I wrote yesterday. Despite this, a in-person
discussion would be more affable to me, even if it deprives 600 voyeurs a
glimpse Boston's laundry sack.

The phone calls you describe receiving at home are regretful. I support you
in calling the callers back and telling them to shove it, but as you wrote
me back-channel one did not identify him/herself. It makes this city look
like Peyton Place! But I suppose smallness is a tradition not limited to
Boston. And I know anecdotes to prove this but am sworn, as they say, to
secrecy.

I am signing off on this subject unless new material arises.

It seems to me Jacques was suggesting not that Wieners isn't in the hearts
and minds of many poets in Boston, or that Lansing wasn't able to put
across some compelling poetry, but that there doesn't seem to be a sense of
mission or "progress" in the group of younger poets, and that this can be
attributable to the indifference of these poets to thinking about or
through these issues along with creating their work.  "Exerting influence"
is more than just being alive and being read, but at least in Jacques'
sense also means circulating ideas, either in prose or in person.  Also,
Poetry as balm for the soul or as freeway to transcendance are constructs
that has been quite tortuously deconstructed or at least debated elsewhere
in the States (often enough in the context of the "local") but which, he
suggests, hasn't been dealt with at all for or in Boston.  I'm interested
in knowing if this anti- or counter-humanist discourse never took root in
Boston partly as a result of class issues -- the "other" big 20th century
poets we think of as Bostonians, such as Amy Lowell, John Wheelright, and
Robert Lowell, are all from the upper classes, which I tend to think have a
liberal bent there? -- but also because of perhaps a neglect of European
influence (or a lack of Europeans), or a too strong identity as the source
of American philosophy, or what?  I agree with Dan that the inny and outy
aspect of Jacques post was a bit too boldly (as in exaggeratedly, but also
daringly) drawn, but if you want to think of Boston as an entity in
American poetics it seems a place to start.

this year's Socialites won the coin, were given the ball and they were off.
success was everywhere, that grandiose cataclysm that says HEY, CHECK IT OUT
I HAVE MARBLES. (as I write these words I realize that I don't, poor me: the
distraught faction at work).

the Socialites were fried by the end of events, they looked googolplexed, as
timeless as last year's vacation. BUT IT IS THIS YEAR, they were all able to
murmur loudly. those words explained everything, and not a moment too soon.
the social diseases were ambitiously described and brought into perspective.
frankly, some people are half-hearted and some are assholes (excuse the
rubric, language can't begin to say enough).

as social as the Socialites could be, they learned that foundering can be an
explicitly fruitful part of the experiment, as in yelling I AM FOUNDERING IN
THE DIUNAL MAKEUP OF THIS LIFE while, you know, doing something rather more
important (leave it to what you think your imagination can handle, just like
any authority).

the Socialitism that has saved our world extends it, the world that is, by
accepting a vastness of parametres. that means there is a mathematical
insistence in our boundaries, which certainly can make one sleep well, at
night or whenever. the Socialites had a long way to go and decorum to
maintain, so their invention of language took some time, but when that time
was finally taken, the shakedown began in earnest (resistance is a
fabrication made oily by a steady look into the nearest Socialite's eye).

the futility became more than marginal, after all, because the Socialites
were steamed about their place in the world. that should not happen.
everything is wonderful, just check the reports, so mistakes cannot happen.
it's a matter of going to Boston or some damn place and saying HEY WHAT'S
THE HANDLE OF THIS THING?, when by thing I mean some item in the energy
field enclosing my thoughts without begrudging my time/space occupation and
so forth. (okay, I get confused when the discussion appropriates what seemed
an original arrangement then went to town, any town).

fiercely dedicated, the Socialites grew into becoming. that's the shameful
thing, the steady, uphill, where's-my-place-in-society THRUST, as if gasping
out of water were a fish's right (something that one might have trouble
deciding).

the Socialites have felt the pressure, damn it, and the margin seems more
alluring than ever, like the ocean when its piquancy nearly quivers in your
grasp. I'm thinking that, well, as with all things, time and hang up are
just about the same, and all the leftovers can easily be put aside (pardon
me for interrupting).

"There is a specter haunting poetry"

        Jennifer Moxley, Invective Verse
        Writing from the New Coast, 1993

Finally someone has brought out the ghost and made it walk, and talk.  Swift,
light, airy--Jennifer probably wrote her poetics statement in less than an
hour.  When I found it in a book called "Technique," I laughed.  It was a
dash.  It is hilarious and it is incisive.  Here is a poet whose first
thought about her poetics is the right-wing currently consolidating its power
in the halls of that bad joke called Washington.  Her advice is to put down
that cup of coffee and feel the rage.  Time is running out, poetry is a
privilege, and screaming our radical politics from the rooftop doesn't mean a
thing unless the voice belongs to millions.  "Who the fuck are we anyway?"
Jennifer wants to know, and it doesn't sound to me like a rhetorical
question.  Along with her friendly allusion to the Communist Manifesto, in
the space of a single paragraph are plays on the sit-in tactic of the Civil
Rights Movement and an assertion of the classical Marxist position that
Socialism is merely a transitional stage, a tangible and immediate goal en
route to the Pie in the Sky.  Moxley calls the first phase a "benefactor
economy" and she is not dreaming.  I overheard the same demand Thursday from
two bicycle messengers on their lunch break:  "Every good writer should be
guaranteed at least $30,000 a year."  The speaker's co-worker was nodding his
head in emphatic agreement.  I could live with that, at least "until after
the revolution."  Again, I'm quoting Moxley, because she says there's going
to be a revolution, and you can wear whatever you want including your suede
shoes.  I've got mine on tonight for the occasion of hearing what else this
poet might say, a poet who wants to recapture the "public domain for poetry"
(and with an exclamation mark!")  It's another one of her wild ideas, like
THE CALL FOR POETS TO CHANGE THEIR NAMES AT THE END OF EVERY FISCAL
QUARTER--Benjamin was thinking along the same lines when he called the author
a producer, like a director or conductor--some BODY absorbing the current of
the time in current times.  Electricity in the air.  That's what the specter
is, and that's why I find Moxley's theoretical contribution to the New Coast
symposium so exciting and valuable.  She wants excess and abundance and she
wants it now.  Her call for recapturing the public domain reminds me of
something Trotsky thought about.  I can't remember anymore whether he was
writing about the Russian Revolution or French Surrealism when he very
lucidly articulated the phenomenon of combined development.  According to
Trotsky, the avant garde is not a permanent achievement.  It happens once and
once only, out of great sacrifice and against incredible odds, and then it
reaches a crossroads or the crossing of many roads, other levels of
consciousness passing by, surging forward, BEARING THE STAMP OF THEIR
NECESSITY, and if the vanguard foregoes dialogue in the fantasy of its own
intellectual superiority or correctness of method, then it winds up
reproducing itself in an increasing series of diluted gestures.  It spins its
wheels and the efforts of poets or professional revolutionaries that brought
the avant garde onto the stage of history are wasted.  If, on the other hand,
the youth coming out of that vanguard choose to seek dialogue with so-called
"backward" tendencies, combined development can occur--an unpredictable
release of creative energy of vast proportions.  That's about as far as I can
get with that thought for the moment, but it strikes me as somehow in
relation or congruent with Jennifer's anticipation of the possibility of a
popular poetry.  I can't wait to hear her poetry whose desiring is announced
with such ease and aplomb.  Let's welcome the author of "Invective Verse" to
Small Press Traffic and to San Francisco.


Whereever Moxley is worn
all changed, changed utterly
a terrible Beauty is born

In a message dated 8/4/99 12:38:05 PM, waldreid@ZIPLINK.NET writes:

<<I do understand that those who wanted every reader to be as
"alternative" as, say, Wendy Kramer and her wonderful corrugated love
poems, might
have been sometimes disappointed.  But personally I would welcome more
alternative/pluralistic/open-minded/inclusive poetry events at any time,
anywhere.>>

My posts have not been so much Conference reports of course as much as they
have used the Conference as an opportunity to look at, however superficially,
etc., given the inherent limitations of the Listserve medium & the competing
demands on my own time, the state of Boston poetry & the Boston "scene"--
while also acknowledging that it is impossible to be entirely objective about
such things.  After all, I am an interested party.  But complaints like mine
I think are not meant to "focus on small negatives."  Instead I'd argue that
my dissatisfaction is part of the *positive fall out" from the Bo Po
Conference-- that is, the Conference has made some of us dissatisfied with
what we  settle for the rest of the time.

"Alternative" is certainly difficult to think about.  Diane Wald is right to
say that if it means things only like Wendy Kramer's work--the subtext here
implies, if I am reading Diane correctly, the 60s adj "far out" --then the
demands implicated by the term would be too restrictive indeed.  But I'd like
to keep the word "alternative" instead of running away from it, as well as
the words "experimental," "innovative," -- "avant-garde," even-- precisely
because they are so difficult.  The innovative is not, I 'm saying,  a fixed
category but constantly shifting in relation to the doxa, to the routine &
the already codified.  It can mean Wendy Kramer, but it can also mean, as
Brian Kim Stefans has persuasively suggested, Jennifer Moxley's recent work,
in which she shrewdly negotiates "traditions and modes that are not quite in
the ascendant," or Tan Lin's new work in the Boston Review.  In other words,
the alternative is what we use to counter-act-- as Kevin Killian brilliantly
puts it-- the malaise that "everywhere, at every time, . . . must continually
be recuperated and rescued." In contrast, "shining pluralism" sounds like
something everyone would want in the abstract, but this is perhaps what is
wrong, not so much with the term, but with the idea behind it.  "Pluralism"
is a word that is used with insidious effect by the corporations, the
government  & the mass media, & although I admire David Shapiro immensely, I
think even he uses it--though in a much more benign way--to cover-up
important contradictions.  I don't have the time to go into this here, but
Sianne Ngai, in an article I mainly disagree with, discusses  pluralist
ideologies in a very provocative & enlightening way in OPEN LETTER winter 98.


Which leads me to Canada, if not to Vancouver.  Kevin Killian's is a
fascinating question, but of course I am not the one to write about
Vancouver.  There are many Kootenay people who subscribe to the List, I've
noticed.  But Kevin also  writes:

<<Daniel Bouchard has
wisely printed a list of Boston poets attending said Conference and a
second list of poets from elsewhere that also attended, made it
concrete and plain, and frankly speaking as an outsider I wonder how
the New York poets in attendance come off as so much more
sophisticated and/or accomplished and/or experimental than the Boston
ones.  Please clarify.>>

A "scene" is not reducible or equivalent necessarily to the poets who live in
a particular city.  A scene is constituted rather by the formal & informal
structures of affiliation organized, if only loosely, around reading series,
journals, publishing houses, academic venues, private & quasi-public
institutions and foundations like New Langton Arts, and the Poetry Project,
as well as around living rooms and bars.  As Dan's list suggests, Boston is
much less than the sum of its parts.  In the best light, one could say that
it's a city full of many interesting, autonomous poets.  On the other hand,
these parts--as disjunct parts-- lack a certain sufficient, or even liminal,
critical mass.  It's impossible to miss the fact, for example, that Sun &
Moon is in LA, but I'm in Cambridge all the time & I couldn't tell you
exactly where  Exact Change is located.  This is perhaps a bad example, but
the bottom line, I'm beginning to realize, is that Boston/Cambridge is a city
that people spend some time in for whatever reason & then pass through.  I'm
more likely than not in the very same situation myself.  So the structures of
affiliation I alluded to earlier haven't flourished here.  Dan was correct to
criticize what was latently, in my first post, a model of mentorship or
apprenticeship, however the extreme anti-academicism in Boston poetry circles
is in some senses merely reactionary--an understandable response to what has
been here more-than-neglect-- but it  casts things in too Machinaean a
perspective.  Even given all of this bad news, my previous posts have not
adequately acknowledged the indispensable force Michael Franco has been for
encouraging any existing sense of a dynamic among local poets.  In addition
to many other things, his reading series frequently brings extraordinary &
challenging poets to Boston.  But, you see, these readers are only **passing
through** even more quickly than most.  The local magazines, of which there
are practically none now, have also  always published wide-ranging work.
But, once again,  reading them, one got/gets the sense that the most
innovative poetry (however insecure my hold on the term innovative is) was
being "reported" on, "noticed" & "appreciated" -- but not being *produced*
here.  I get the feeling  in fact that this distinction is an important, if a
subconscious one.  Dan was correct to pick up on my List Discussion habit of
collapsing many different kinds of poets into a Boston "pigeon hole."  The
best I can do now, in this venue, however, is to suggest again that the
dominant trend in Boston poetry has been a reluctance to play with language.
My pointing to the absence of a Language poetry presence in Boston in the 70s
& 80s doesn't mean that, as a result,  I miss the presence now, of a local
3rd generation of L poets.  far from it.  What I was suggesting instead that
tL poetry created certain dymnamics being played out currently in SF & NY
that are valuable inasmuch as they are in reaction against as they are in
sympathy with, LP.  If you decide to stay in Boston, it's because other
influences--Black Mountain, say-- are important to you & flourish here.  But
there is no sense  "of six or seven or eight generations" of Boston poets
"all working at once and still feeling a little hung over and millennial
right now."  If it's true, as I think it is, that the people with the most
energy, & the most time here, only *reproduce these  limits* in Boston,  the
weakest part of my remarks was to fault *them* for that.

Finally, Kevin writes: "I'm also not sure what role Lori Lubeski is playing
in your argument"  Actually a number of people have bc'd me to suggest other
names.  Why not then, Donald Wellman.  An extremely interesting poet, he
published O.ARS for 10 yrs in Cambridge, & yet--again with the exception of
Michael Franco-- goes strangely unnoticed & unacknowledged here.

I'm with both Diane and Jacques on the question of the BAPC's
"alternicity."  I agree with Jacques (and many others including Aaron,
the even-organizer, himself) that "Alternative" was a (mildly)
unfortunate choice of word to use in this event's title, particularly as
there are so very few THOROUGHLY alternative ventures of this sort going
on, if you mean, as I do, ventures devoted to kinds of poetry that have
not yet gotten any play, or only token play, in college classes (and
. . . seminars), or in any publication by a commercial or university
press.

Of course, "alternative" can refer to much else, including very
traditional verse that happens to be composed by poets not yet known
anywhere.  Ergo, a person organizing an event like the BAPC who uses the
term to describe the event ought--assuming he has time for such very
minor details--to define what he means as carefully as possible.
"Pluralistic" would seem to have been the better word here.  (And one
need not be a word-fetishist to believe words ought to mean something
reasonably specific.)

I agree whole-heartedly with what I take Diane to have been saying: that
what really counts is that Aaron did a first-rate job putting together
last year's event, which I attended (and later--gently, I
hope--criticized in my Small Press Review column for not being very
"alternative," as I use the term), and seems to have done at least as
well this time around.  Certainly, he's gotten an amazingly wide and
good selection of poets to Boston these past two years.  I wish I had
had the dough to get up for it this year.

Dear Deep South Listee:

We'd like to inform you that the deadline for
submitting proposals/papers for panels at this
year's Deep South Writers Conference has been
extended to August 25th. Here are descriptions of
what we're doing this year:


                 PANELS

   This fall's Deep South Writers Conference
invites submissions of brief papers for several
panels relating Creative Writing Pedagogy to our
theme of the "local." Panels will consist of short
introductory statements by each panelist, followed
by open discussion of the topic.

Panel #1: The "Local" and the Creative Writing
Classroom

   What are the important considerations and
possibilities for teachers of creative writing
concerning the ways in which our students respond
to questions of locality--of region, geography,
ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or other
"local" markers? Presentations may be "case
studies" of particular localities or theoretical
discussions of some aspect of the "local," or may
explore the effects of "the local" on specific
pedagogical concerns.

Panel #2: Open Topic

   Fifteen-minute papers on any issue pertaining
to teaching creative writing.

Panel #3: Exploiting One's Place

   How may one's given place be used in new or
unusual ways to make creative writing students
more vital writers? We would especially like to
see papers or proposals treating the relations
between creative writing and local music,
photography, dance, environmental art, painting,
etc.

^For all panels, full versions of fifteen-minute
papers are due August 25th, 1999. Please submit
queries or papers (identify panel for which
submission is intended) to:

Panel # 1, Panel #2, or Panel #3
Deep South Writers Conference
USL Box 44691-English Dept.
University of Southwestern Lousiana
Lafayette LA 70504-4691

Queries for all panels may also be addressed to

Hello to all from David Kirschenbaum, editor of Boog Literature, a new
addition to this here list.

Eight years ago today, we published the first two Boog chapbooks in Albany,
New York, and it's been a fun ride. To all out there who  crossed my path
along the way; influenced me/the press (one thing?); contributed work to
various publications; performed at the many different events; collated,
stapled and distributed; and opened their homes to me as though I were kin,
thanks.
Sometimes the flow has not been as strong, but since 1991, each year new
words have been published that somewhere say Boog on 'em. For that, I thank
you all.
A special shout-out to Katie Yates- for her advice and getting me to Naropa;
d.a levy- spirit guide; Lawrence Ferlinghetti- for showing the way; Ed
Sanders- for his words of encouragement, constant feedback and
contributions; David Baratier and Kent Fielding- for their friendship and
late nite talks about being an editor and a poet; Meg Arthurs- for her
glorious art; Douglas Brinkley- for introducing me to Lou Reed and Naropa;

One interesting thing about the word "Alternative" in a title for a poetry
conference in Boston is that, for some of us who are attentive to scenes
and locations, it's redundant -- if the poetry really has something to do
with Boston, then it's probably alternative to the rest of us.  I tend to
think that beyond aesthetic and political lines, the idea of poetries from
"alternative" places is beginning to get pretty interesting, since the
poetry takes on anthropological value for what it's worth, and in our times
with nationalism and plurality are such violently heated issues we can use
our analysis as a sort of petrii dish mirroring the world at large.

Anyway, wanted to share this snippet from an unnamed poet from England whom
I hardly know, who sent on this bit about the British scene:

"No, I wouldn't disagree that the scene in the UK lacks new younger writers
to carry the baton, mostly.  It's sort of strange, in that when I visited
Cambridge in the mid-1990s there seemed to be quite a vibrant crowd of
bright young(ish) things (Helen MacDonald, DS Marriott, Rob MacKenzie,
Karlien van den Beukel, etc.) but then there was a long gap where no young
writers seemed to be coming up (this is now remedied by the activities of
Keston Sutherland & co. I gather).  Drew Milne when I asked thought that
the mid-90s "bulge" was largely the work of Stephen Rodefer's getting the
kids excited, & that things went flat when he left."

I think this is interesting in relation to this idea of poets "passing
through," since as the lore has it Jack Spicer passing through Vancouver
and giving his lectures seemed to create part of the ambiance that led to
Tisch, which then led to Kootenay, etc.  And of course Rodefer, to those
who know him, carries out something of the Spicerian function in the
communities he has touched over the years -- I described him to this
British poet as "divisive" (in a quasi-pejorative sense) in some contexts
such as New York's which has a pretty strong if inchoate "community," and I
guess conducive to "poetry" in the context of Cambridge in the mid-90s.
Cambridge, by the way, has many strong poets in its immediate area, such as
Jeremy Prynne, and of course its Cambridge, so it's not the boondocks.  So
why did it need Rodefer?

(Footnote: Rodefer, by the way, seemed important enough to Iain Sinclair to
be included in the major British Poetry anthology Conductors of Chaos in
1997 or so, though he had been in Brooklyn for a number of months by the
time it came out.  Also, this isn't to say he doesn't have a good effect in
New York as well, otherwise I wouldn't be writing about him.  It's also
worth noting that folks like Jennifer Moxley, Bill Luoma, Doug Rothschild,
etc. studied with him in California, hence he's helped shape a generation
there.)

I introduce this since Stephen is a very peculiar type of person in poetry
society, which is that, besides his immortal escapades, he seems very
attentive to younger writers -- to the point of oversensitivity sometimes
-- and badgers them about their work, he likes to make high-minded
pronouncements which half the time are nonsense and the other half very
provocative (don't ask for more exact percentages), and he has, to boot,
stories to tell about his time with poets like Olson, while at the same
time having produced a book like "Four Lectures" which is seen to be a
classic of sorts for language poetics.  So he's kind of still a beatnik,
kind of a post-structuralist, etc., has some sort of natural lineage, but
also likes to hang out.  I don't know if he's written any criticism at all,
but I would have to guess he has -- in any case, it's not his Selected
Essays doing the work.  As a side note, nobody questions Stephen's ties to
institutions -- he has none, never has, I think, besides brief teaching
stints.

Anyway, I guess the point is that a person like Rodefer provides something
like the social glue that seems to keep communities together.  The "glue"
is partly the result of talent, interest, intention, but also irrational
and, in the standard sense, "social".  I remember a friend of mine the U.K.
complaining that a certain young lady would only go to the poetry readings
to flirt and meet guys -- he found this offensive, but I countered that,
heck, if you want this scene to start up, if you want all these poets who
are really pretty hard-headed, stuck up, intense etc. to spend the
inordinate amount of time with each other that it takes to form a scene,
then some of these minor details will have to be overlooked.  I also said
that you should be sure that everybody has a house or apt. to go to after
the readings to get drunk, otherwise nobody will ever talk about the
reading again.  The scene, in other words, would have to handle certain
other needs that poets have in abundance, such as that of getting
attention, letting loose, meeting people, etc.  (To be snide, I would add
that half if not more of the poetry you hear at a reading is pretty bad, so
if you make a reading hang solely on the entertainment value of the poet,
string a few bad ones like that in a row and The End.)  (I heard the
readings in Boston got a bit flat after a while, for what it's worth.)

This may all sound silly but I just wanted to counter the impression that
good intentions ("pluralisms", tolerance) in the form social programs,
revamped institutions, or any other injection of capital into an community,
urban or not, are necessarily going to bring about a poetry revival, or
that any are even necessary.  If a "scene" is to develop in a "place", it
seems a first step would be to have those poets be interested in that
place, and (for it to be "collective") in each other's work and lives.
Showing off is also fair motivation in this game, if you want it (though it
gets annoying), which seems only possible when people are looking.

at 4:05 pm on any weekday the miners finish their logical work. they remove
their pickaxes from the latest vein and to the surface return. a story will
come to some, a poem to others. this is the dimming of the day. bottles of
alcoholic whatever may be shared and the words flow. every river has its
image to maintain, of course, and the miners are never dumbfounded by this
truism. they look to the setting sun, which has a redness that bridges
spectra of doubt, an especially potent effect after a day in the darksome
mines. the glory starts to work, and glory joins glory. the words flow, as
has been said. the happy miners maybe sing songs, new compound words jetting
up to dance in the air, tra la. a simple verb/noun effect occurs, a strange
re-vision of what had seemed a forgettable act. but no, lodged in the
movements of the two words (whichever ones) a world of possibly imaginative
underpinnings reveals itself. you are aware, dear reader, that this
spectacle becomes a necessity for these dedicated workers, and maybe to you,
as well. the seemingly scant jobs of pick and shovel transcend the dailiness
of their actions. the miners enjoy the dulcet drunkenness that has led them
to readjust once again the edges. this becomes a process that resembles the
making of music except that they introspect as they advert. the cage has
been withdrawn momently. some children race to play on the darkening
green -- why not? -- but the adults, thrilled to be free of their mining
ordeal, have launched into a maelstrom just as sinuous as a diaphanous
supermarket. in the treasury of what can be done, the resistance truly
fades. the program will be repeated tomorrow, but you'll have to learn to
tune in.

I would like to be the 2nd -- or is it 3rd? -- hippest person here by
strangely noticing and acknowledging Donald Wellman's contribution to the
Big Whatever that we seem to be talking about. (I have clout, by the way,
but it's the kind that covers my loins, tant pis). seriously, because this
is serious, O.ARS was a pretty damn interesting journal, varied and vibrant
(don't let the alliteration distract you from the words) which ought to give
every reader the thought: the man put some effort into this. my experience
is not extensive, other nobles certainly exist, but I can think of Leland
Hickman's Temblor and Tom Beckett's The Difficulties as journals that, along
with O.ARS, elevated the idea of such publications to a state both personal
and generous. id est, submission guidelines and publication hassles (what a
gruesome thread that was!) were backgrounded, _behind_ the stuff on the
page. like, what they did wasn't some dreamy career move but a  living
reality, dirt under the nails and all. these missives from elsewhere, news I
really could use, crept into my mailbox irregularly but welcomed; I thank
the editors who made them possible. and I think my further point is: quit
griping, things are happening, in Boston and elsewhere. and if they aint,
_you_ aint noticing: you bought the wrong farm. and by the way, isn't this
regionalism stuff being talked just about corny? I live within the Boston
sphere and root for the Red Sox, but my heart skips nary a beat when they
trounce the Yankees or vice versa. I mean, who cares which aisle at the
supermarket you line up in? it's what you do with the groceries that counts.

The discussion of the Boston conference has, if nothing else, clarified
problems of community outside of Boston, or New York, or wherever, as well
as within these places.  The intent of Jacques' posts thus far seem to have
been aimed at his ability to find a community within which he can do the
work he currently deems essential.  This is not to say that there is no
poetic community - there have been several mentioned, in fact - flourishing
in Boston, but that the nature of the relationship between any of these
communmities and the work that Jacques feels compelled toward at present is
one in a fetal stage that for a variety of reasons can't or won't develop.
In light of Kevin Killian's comment

that poetry has always to be rescued from the mileau in which it occurs, it
seems there might usefully be more discussion about individual
responsibility viz. finding a relationship to some "larger" poetic
community, and trying to make it work.  I want to say something about a
certain "critical spirit" in this, but it's a difficult topic to address

with its mix of issues involving loyalties, beliefs, fears and the like.
Nevertheless, and as painful as it might be, there has to be some gut level
discussion of on-the-ground specifics, ie., who one does or does not "get"
that "thing" - a working 'ground'? that Jacques I think is saying he doesn't
consistently get in Boston - from, and why (not).  Not that this has to be
in the mode of "dirty laundry."
One of the big problems in establishing community, or rather relations
within community is

the part criticism plays, at what level it is functional, and how it can be
introduced in some way more fruitful than yielding, for example, the obscene
phonecalls Jacques received in response to his, I thought, mildly critical
first post.  The question is, how specific, viz "others" (& their work) is
it possible to be while at the same time maintaining some momentum toward
furtherance?  How do we avoid outright stoppage in the equivalent reaction
of spitting on one's peers?  Is it possible to contest

what issues of a future will be those most "deserving" of attention without
becoming wolfishly defensive upon presentation of like ideas and terms by
those who might initially appear to be nullifying all you feel you are
working in, on and toward?  What's the method?  Or will it always be this
beautifully

unfulfilled provisional slogging forth with mud on our boots, full, still,
of all that comes of being 'present' in this Lost Kingdom in completely
unexpected ways?  But the question still remains, how

useful might it be to "name names" viz. one's feeling for community (to be
crude about it, who's hot & otherwise not) in some more public forum, rather
than to leave the subtleties of community relationship issues to the more
intimately unheard, private (maybe also solo?) voice?  This, in part, is
what the Boston discussion IS, yet

it's disturbing that it's couched so much as general conditions rather than
specific tale.  Humankind, perhaps, in any state other than astraction, is
more hideous than words can tell, tho of course, there's always reason to
doubt, the cause toward further clarity.  Is there more to notice about each
our isolation?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello.

I'd like to offer a few, okay several (dis)jointed and rambling comments.

I'm a Boston native, living here for 4 years in SF (that's San Francisco).

Certainly my eyes opened wide to hear about an "alternative" poetry
conference in Boston, the 2nd annual, no less.  Wish I could've been there;
wish this had happened 10 years ago.  But then, I'm sure it had, and then,
I know it did again.  And again. And will.  So.

Regionalism is just that.  Boston always gets short shrift in the
competition for center of the universe, and really, so what?  Community
happens wherever you are, and so does poetry.  Schools or centers of any
kind of thought/production often produce repetitions.  What's been exciting
has been to know that there's all kinds of poetry going on, everywhere, all
the time.  I just need to speak more languages, within the American tree of
words, and with the roots of other countries.
Someone asked who among the Alt Bo Po line up was actually "from" Boston.
There was some brave poet there who read with "heart"?  Does that mean our
notorious honking accent?  (I'm laughing here.)

(I, like Bo Po's organizer, Kiely, am yet another "uncredentialed"
independent doing whatever I want or feels needs to be done, on my own
terms, and with help from friends.  This "alternative" way of doing things
is often collapsed into "activism", which is fine with me.  And I think
this point warrants another conversation about what and whom is being
measured and legitimized, and by whom, with what, what yield?  Academic
elitism, romanticized movements, idolatry, clout and influence indeed.)

Boston is a big college town with a 5% sales tax and a hard core local
populace perpetually chafing against transient intellectuals and their
overwhelmingly khaki influence on the city's personality, or lack thereof,
as well as more of the same  between working classes and Boston Brahmins,
between races with no money, etc.  Almost like anywhere, but with a
particularly icy vengeance.  Maria Damon, you may recall that miserable
failure, the "Where's Boston" campaign from about 25 years ago, which was
just as much about the "who" and the "what" as the "where".

So I think I understand the ambivalences of the city, and the impact it can
have on the writing of those who come or stay.  Especially in the shadow of
NYC, or in contrast to the New West, or That Other Happening Country Up
North, or in light of internalized anguish for having never been the
"center" of a "movement" of innovative note, for all its heavily endowed
schools, not to mentioned its fabled unsophisticated accent.  So many
rulers to break.  What does this really have to do with what the writers at
the Alt Bo Po conference presented?  Nothing, really.  The organizer made
some choices, the readers made some choices, interpretation was open,
everybody went home with more than they brought, and there it is.

(Thanks, Jack Kimball, for sharing with us your what you saw and heard at
the conference.  I really felt like I was there during the Emily Dickinson
parade.)

For all of my literary life in Boston, I was the only Boston native in my
community, which was at that time The Dark Room Writers Collective, for
nearly 10 years.   There were about 15 of us at the best of times.

We thought we were an alternative, simply for providing workshops and a
reading series that featured writers of African descent, and we were.  On
our schedules were Erica Hunt, Julie Patton, Nathaniel Mackey, Ntozake
Shange, John Keene (DR member), Sam Delany, Dolores Kendrick, Kofi Natambu,
Kevin Young (DR member) David Henderson, Harryette Mullen, myself, and a
particularly memorable tribute to Bob Kaufman in 1990.

(And while I'm glad Prageeta Sharma and Will Alexander were in the house at
this Alt Bo Po, yeah?  Alternative for whom is another question.  I
forwarded the event announcement to my friends back East; none of them had
even heard of it.   Who's counting who's missing?  What makes an
alternative? Where/when does the audience come in?  etc. etc. )

Anyway, writers who wouldn't necessarily be considered "avant-garde" were
also on the DR schedule.  My point?  Just that.  It was an accessible
alternative (yes, Jacques, the "slipperiness of the term") to what
Harvard/BU/MIT/Northeastern offered (the series was in our home, and had no
support/connection to any of them; we paid out of pocket for everything
with our dues), and made a difference, to those in the know and those just
getting to it.  What did it say "about" "Boston" poets?  Nothing, really,
or something predictably unsavory, since when someone said something
"about" "Boston" poets, they didn't, and rightly couldn't, mean "us" (well,
excluding me, I guess).
Everyone was from everywhere, and would go back out "there" at some point
to get more of what they brought with them.  About innovation and
experimentation?  That everyone, at some time or another, did a little
something, some more often than others, it was all about seeing the
threads, potential of the past, and the dangers of the monolithic.  About
the scene?  Well, some deserved praise unfortunately frequented by the word
"renaissance", but praise nonetheless (and sure enough, it's over now).
And nice, donation bearing crowds.  It was a lot of work, very trying, and
a lot of fun.

Was Boston turned into a colored writers' mecca? (Kevin Killian, I'm
thinking about what you said re: the Boston/Vancouver connection).  No, it
most certainly wasn't.  Sometimes there's no overcoming history.  (Damn Red
Sox!)

Will it turn itself into what Vancouver has?  Who's to say it hasn't?  But
I must say, if it wasn't for Harvard/MIT/BU, (and occasional treks to
UMass/Amherst and, gasp!  Yale) I would never have seen in such numbers the
experimentalists (my definition) I did see over the years there, actually,
for all their conservatism and misapprehension of the term "outreach".

What was happening then in the DR was necessary but not perfect,  as the Bo
Po conference certainly was and was not, and other things will be and not
be.

Surely, as one of the few "avant-garde" writers within the Collective, I
certainly wanted more from our scheduling and focus, but was glad to get
what I got and give what I gave.

Tisa

Several weeks ago someone on the list mentioned a few good books on poetry,
one of which was "The New Sentence."  I could be mistaken, but there was a
note that this one was probably out of print.  Since I wanted a copy, I
checked Small Press Distribution, Roof Books, and some of the mail-order
companies on the web, and they all show it as available--and I did place an
order with SPD.

Sorry if I'm mistaken.  I just want to ask the person who submitted that
post if he/she would please repost that list.  It looked good, but I
absentmindedly delete it.  I've looked through the archives for the terms
Silliman and Sentence, and they don't lead to what I want.

In case this was on my other list (Poetry, etc.), I'm posting it there also.

Cheers,

Bob Freedman

Dear Hank,

I'll be back on the air today in a special program which will feature, among
others, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. This is a statement I'll

Hey Hey
KPFA
Free Speech
Won't go away

    This is Jack Foley, glad to be back on the air in this crisis
programming. There's a phrase associated with a show which is no longer on
KPFA: "Freedom is a Constant Struggle." The program was hosted by Kiilu
Nyasha, who continues to present it on Liberation Radio (93.7 FM) Wednesday
nights from 7 to 9. There are personal dimensions to freedom, but there are
also public dimensions. As someone who has worked at KPFA for ten of its
fifty years, I find myself acutely aware of both, and acutely aware as well
of the need for "struggle."

    The philosopher Martin Heidegger once said that freedom is not only
something you "have," it is something you "are." We at KPFA are struggling to
"have" freedom_and we will get it_but we could not struggle unless we were
aware of the radical freedom that lies at the heart of every person. The New
England town meeting, with its cacaphony of voices, is one paradigm for
democracy, but it is a paradigm which is no longer fully useful. In its
diversity, the United States can hardly see itself as "New England." We can
no longer fantasize that we are a small town largely made up of Protestants.
The idea of the town meeting has to become the more sophisticated and open
idea of multiculturalism_has in fact already become the idea of
multiculturalism. It is this idea that KPFA welcomes and recognizes.
Multiculturalism is that situation in which everything comments on everything
else, in which everything stays open to the possibility of the other. Multi
is to culture as multi is to media. It is something "other" which intersects,
comments upon, and recognizes. Multi is to culture as poly is to theism; as
diversity is to university. We don't have to look far for examples. Our minds
are multiple, and it is this multiplicity that gives us our truest freedom.
At our roots we are creatures of possibilities, and when we lose the sense of
possibilities_when we arrive at what Jennifer Stone calls "hardening of the
categories"_we lose almost everything that defines us as human. The idea of
KPFA is a refusal to look only at some possibilities. The myth of Pandora's
Box is a myth of closure and repression. What is in there is not the ills of
the world but the possibility of the new, the other, the different. KPFA
wants to open Pandora's Box.

    There's a passage I like in Ishmael Reed's anthology, MultiAmerica. It
was written by Bharati Mukherjee, and it is particularly relevant to the
struggle of KPFA with Pacifica:

          What we have going for us in the 1990s is the exciting chance to
share in the making of a new American culture, rather than the coerced
acceptance of either the failed nineteenth-century model of "melting pot" or
the Canadian model of the "multicultural mosaic"...I want to sensitize you to
think of culture and nationhood not as an uneasy aggregate of antagonistic
"them" and "us," but as a constantly re-forming, transmogrifying "we."

I'm looking for thoughtful writings (on or off the Web) about the cut up and
related devices.

Burroughs, I know, has written interesting things, notably in The Job. Also, Jerome
McGann has a great essay relevant to the subject at
http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/mcgann.html and Robert Kendall has an
equally good essay at http://www.altx.com/ebr/ebr5/kendall.htm

This concerns a project of mine (and others) I'm working on at
http://www.vispo.com/StirFryTexts (needs IE 4 or 5).

Basically, I'm looking for deep insights (not just history) on the relevance of cut
ups (and related devices) to the last 40 years, with particular emphasis on the Web
over the last 5 years.

Thanks,
Jim Andrews

Subject:      Talk's Riding
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I wonder if anyone else in  Poetics List Land noticed that in the premiere
issue of Talk magazine, just out, there is a piece on Laura Riding, detailing
her close encounter with Schuyler Jackson and family in 1939? It's remarkable
that Riding gets such a big spread, with a full page picture, in this
magazine,
but regrettable that only a few lines of her writing are included. More
surprising, and unfortunate, is the impression given by the article that
(Riding) Jackson stopped writing and settled down to become a housewife for
the
last fifty years of her life. The piece says she never wrote poetry again
after
meeting Jackson, but fails to note the voluminous "prose" that constitutes her
later work, thus wiping out all reference to The Telling, Rational Meaning and
her other essays of the 50s-80s. The article also says that Riding stopped
writing poetry as a direct result of the break-up of Jackson's family, not
only
ignoring (Riding) Jackson's extensive commentary on this issue in her later
work, but also ignoring the many premonitions of this renunciation of
poetry in
her earlier work. Thus, one of Riding's most significant aesthetic and
philosophical positions is reduced to bathos. Of course, this article is not
about Riding's work but about one of the most notorious events in her life,
here given full tabloid treatment (but it's worth noting that there is nothing
new in this piece; it is pretty much a recycling of previously reported facts,
even the "spin" is old). The author at one point says something to the effect
that many poets are crazy -- the Blakes sitting naked in a tree, Pound's
speeches on behalf of Mussolini, and Riding's "witch"-like break up of the
Jacksons. There is also a description of Riding as being "hooked-nose" and
unattractive, in contrast to the handsome Robert Graves. The piece ends with
the suggestion that feminists are likely to lead any revival of interest in
Riding but that, unlike Dickinson and Plath, she may not be a good role model
for "womankind", since she is a two-time homewrecker. (Presumably suicide is
more suitable for the woman writer than the sort of intellectual and social
aggressivity of "hook-nosed" Riding.) I should note that I am recounting this
from memory as I do not have a copy of the magazine at hand. But I believe
I am
conveying the drift. And the part I dislike most: here I am talking about
TALK,
right according to plan.

File this under: Spreading myself too thin <pls excuse the mass-mail>

A friend of mine and I are trying to put together a festival/night of
2-minute plays.

What we need: playwrights, actors and directors. Have some, need way
more.

The concept: low-budget, non-playhouse venue, bunches of short short
plays, intermissions for drink-buying and chatter, fun, maybe even money
raised for charity. Maybe around 1.5 - two hours all told, so room for
lots of work.

Plays or monologues in need of actors/directors welcome. Plays or
monologues with self-provided actors/directors welcome. Maybe even
excerpts from non-original plays with actors/directors provided welcome
(that is currently in debate). Hoping for a diverse body of
subjects/styles/aesthetics. The two minute rule is probably pretty
loose, might even let them go as long as 4 minutes?

Depending on number and quality of scripts received we will jury out the
winners and go from there. Depending on success of first try, we will
also see if we go from there.

Nobody will make any money off of this (except maybe a charity, see
above). If lucky we'll be able to cover advertising costs or something.
Participants, however, may be spotted by an agent and whisked away to a
profitable career in porn.

This idea is evolving. We are hoping to roll out a night of work before
the end of October, but the date is arbitrary at this point. Please
email me at <perez@magnet.com> if interested in any capacity and please
note the capacity that would interest you. Multiple capacities accepted
and encouraged. We're going for community here, people.

Please pass this notice to anyone you feel may be interested. Note, this
event will take place in Washington, D.C. Those somewhat in the area
will obviously be given preference.

Of course the key explicatory text by Burroughs on the cut-up technique is
THE THIRD MIND.  The LA County Museum catalogue for the recent exhibition of
Burroughs's artwork--PORTS OF ENTRY--has a number of insightful articles on
the cut-up method, & just as helpfully, a very strong bibliography.  Also,
off the top of my head, Jim Rosenberg in POETICS JOURNAL 10, discusses both
the cut-up & hypertext in a good article.  & Reva Wolf's book, ANDY WARHOL,
POETRY & GOSSIP IN THE 1960s, discusses the cut-ups briefly in connection
with THE TENNIS COURT OATH, & the appropriative strategies of Pop art.

Apologies for the second note.  I just wanted to add that, while connecting
the cut-ups to recent developments in Web technologies is certainly
legitimate, you'd also want to avoid the dangers of historical
de-contextualization.  Burroughs's work emerged after all at a crucial
moment--along with Cage's & Ashbery's--when 60s artists were confronting
commodity culture really for the first time.  Related issues such as the
homosexualization of the New York avant-garde, the conflicted reaction
against Abstract Expressionist culture, the initial & then-ongoing  US
reception of Dada, as well as-- to the extent that this was being played out
on 2 continents--Burroughs's & Ashbery's relations with & attitudes toward,
for example, TEL QUEL, are all issues that, although they don't each have to
be considered in the context of your study, nonetheless give Burroughs's
cut-up method a specific rather than a merely analogical & general
significance.

Never heard this lore, myself, but I can tell you that Tish was started 4
or 5 years before Spicer's Vancouver visit. Robert Duncan, who visisted and
engaged with a forming community of young poets in Vancouver in 1960 or
'61,was the American poet most responsible for the encouragement that kept
Tish afloat. Robert Creeley, who visited and in an informal setting, taught
these same people the following summer, should also be credited.

Spicer's visit in '65 surely kept the flame of counter-poetics alight. But
just to set the record straight. (George Bowering cd do a better job; you
out there, G?)

Not to take anything away from Brian's post, which I enjoy for its ranging
x-Atlantic and for its discussion of Rodefer's role/s. Btw, anyone got a
current e-ddress for SR? If so, please b-c to me.

stretches from Pound and Eliot, through to the likes of Olson, Duncan,
Rukeyser, Snyder, Dorn and Jay Wright:  he is the only one to have produced
substantial and accomplished bodies of work as a poet and as an
anthropologist and the only one to have written at length on the
interactions of literature and anthropology. . .=20
        . . . Narrated through multiple narratives and many voices, the book
deals with a religious conflict between indigenous religion and
Christianity. The theft of masks covering Maxim=F3n, a Mayan wooden statue
venerated since pre-Columbian times, and the later return of one of the
masks over twenty years later, is the core around which are spun accounts
of Mayan mythology, ritual practices, religious festivals, individual life
histories, local social conflicts and the horrors of Guatemala's national
politics. "=20

Anyone interested in research on Riding would (eventually, at least) want
to see the papers of Ronald Bottrall, the British poet, who for a time --
during the Graves episode -- was deeply influenced by Riding. Amongst the
letters between Bottrall and Riding are examples of her voluminous
marginalia in Bottrall's poetic mss. The Bottrall papers are in the Ransom
Center at Texas.

All best,

Speaking as one who has broken up several marriages by sitting naked in a
tree ranting like Pound on Mussolini & believing my nose to be hooked, a
poet in brief, albeit no Dickinson nor Plath, I have seldom envied Robert
Graves  because I figure I can always fall in love with handsome people if
I absolutely must. That is, I'm crazy to show that you are. But away with
biography, because the imperative via 19th C "great men" theory unquote
just wont quit, to reduce words to life. Thank _Charles_ for the info and
the qualification of same. Sounds like an article I'd like to read in a
bathtub full of hot water, slowly nodding off as it slips into oblivion.
Maybe I'll try that tomorrow.

Charles,

Will you please stop talking about TALK according to plan, and WRITE for TALK?

It is a terrific opening to have great US poet in premiere issue. Laura
Riding knew the demands of poetry to the bone her prose is despite her.

Send your Letter to the Editor _to_ the Editor (or, better, get your agent to
press them for a reply, or better, have Tina give you a Column!). The
linesmen of capital have made a hole in reality/dear Ballcarrier please storm

While the inadequacies described of TALK's piece on Riding make it a typical
annoyance of journalism, what is the best tactic against it?

I favour no mention of the publication outside discussion on the list or in
similar locations.
& a dismissive one-liner if anyone outside raises it as if it were reliable,
when seeking to use it to diss -- in this instance -- Riding or modern
poetry.

What do others on the list do in such circumstances?

Tisa,

Was great to read your piece and as well see John Keene mentioned in
your list.  I was blown away by his memoir/novel _Annotations_ published
by New Directions (I believe at the Outwrite conference he said he was
the second African American published by ND in its history--the other
Bob Kaufman).  I looked him up and he has an excellent website with cool
on line poetry innovation:
http://pages.nyu.edu/~jrk3150/poem.html

but I guess he hasn't been in Boston for a while.

it was quite a day. the energy transmitted much of value. the miners rested
at home, a much-needed day off. tomorrow, the effort would continue. the
thing would be exposed, like it or not. some damn troubadour will expect
reward, silly painters will thrill at the latest product of their
imagination, and seeds will be sown, for whatever worth of any of that.
obnoxious as all that might be, still, you can't blame them their forward
district presence. they have the haven and they know how to use it. that's
why sitting at the machine feels so good. simply wielding the pickaxe in
knowledgeable grace completes the picture of perfect focus. we aren't
children, none of us are, but we have grit. that grit has been earned, from
scraping the ore and fighting tooth and nail with the elemental silliness of
the mined Earth. no one is keeping records of the business that keeps on, no
matter the weather. today is just a moon phase in a stream of varying
lights. that's no joke and could prove important, if anyone manages to read
the book. first the book must be sent with viscous force to the proper
authority and let the wind direct it fortunately to its destined final nest.
and all this time we will have struggled out of torn coats to give the
pauper standing in the left part of our dream room. what are you going to
say when the miners waken, strengthened by resolve and flushed to get back
to work? you will praise, you will encourage, you will try to carry on.
there's no message here, it's just the sensible etiquette of a far from
impossible situation.

FURTHER SHILLING FOR TINA BROWN:
Riding HERSELF

To "read TALK"
is a familiar expression. The experience
of reading TALK differs
from that of
knowing a fact. The thing
known, in this case
LAURA RIDING, exists --
once known as a component
of one's own working equipment,
as something with
which one thinks. A Laura
Riding is one's own Laura Riding.
It is also a fixture
of common lore
of rational distinctions of
tried mental workability.

There is no issue
as to TALK
and LAURA RIDING,
from the linguistic
point of view, except in regard
to knowledge: the knowledge of
Laura Riding is differently
constituted from that
of the knowledge  of Laura Riding.


shillingly, Gerald

synagogue which was first a hotel for
former loan arks and transient architects

from whom the lobby benefited with their
unorthodox payment of restringing lamps,

ducting load-bearers, dying carpets and
spreading rugs over weakened damp areas

of the plywood styrofoam floors which
sagged like mattresses under the coming

and goings of many feet like thunder
rolls through the insulated city.

 . . . about 459 miles east of buffalo.

Tisa, you hit it right on the head for me here, in re The Dark Room
Collective being an "accessible alternative" : --

There's a lot going on in Boston any day of the week, and I went to a lot
when I lived there for several years, but never found a scene that really
compelled me -- so were they really accessible?  They were *there,* some
more open than others. (I found DR, btw, one of the more open bunch of
people, compelled as I was to on one occassion read when I hadn't brought
any poems with me, and went up extempore to re-poem what I thought I'd
written and had by memory.) One thing Aaron's done is to increase
accessibility both for the Boston scene(s) and the people who levitate
(back) towards them in their yet-another sweep through the area.  The
conversations that are spinning off _here_ I take as a sign of that
accessibility (not to mention that my priviness to them a sign of what this
list makes accessible).  The forum's got to exist to address concerns (such
as Jacques'), to find/make direction(s).

Here's Fred Muratori's review of Armand Schwerner's _Selected Shorter
Poems_ and _The Tablets_ in the August _Library Journal_.


>Schwerner (1927-99) was a maximalist, a poet of expansive aims and
encyclopedic learning whose interest in anthropology and religion fueled a
poetry that explored the very nature of civilization. The simultaneous
publication of his lifelong project, _The Tablets_, and a generous
selection of shorter poems, most out of print, is likely to fix his
position among major postwar experimenters such as Robert Duncan, Louis
Zukofsky, and Charles Olson, with whom he has been compared. _The Tablets_
is the fictional restoration and analysis of an ancient Sumerian text,
complete with scholarly notes, pictographs, debatable translations, and
missing or lost passages. More than that, it's a huge vessel into which the
poet deposits aspects of his own identity while probing the process of
epistemology itself. In a manner similar to that of the late avant-garde
Canadian poet bpNichol, Schwerner laces his mock-academic pursuit with
humor, invention, and an almost electric opassion. The same qualities are
found in Schwerner's lyric meditations, as the poet attempts to articulate
how the "variegated mystery" of the self can achieve synthesis, becoming
"the one mind in orchestration." Again, he draws on a "wild spectrum" of
sources--Eskimo poetry, Buddhism, Zuni myths--but frequently allows his
playful sense of language ("How remunerative/ to be eleemosynary") to
lighten the oracular load. Earnest and eccentric, stuffed with enough
puzzles to keep poetry readers and scholars delightfully busy through the
next century, these two volumes are essential for all libraries with
substantial poetry collections.
>

_Selected Shorter Poems_, at 144 pages, contains Armand's own selection of
two-thirds of his non-Tablets poetry, including poems that have only
appeared in periodicals.



Here's the review, anonymous as usual, of Mervyn Taylor's _The Goat_ from
July's _Publishers Weekly_.

>Taylor's New York poems comprise a roughly virtuosic series of
contemporary vignettes laced with apocalpse; they are attuned to the pain
in all desire and the beauty in decay--not unlike Lorca's explorations of
the city. Beginning "one of those nights/ when the intersection is crazy/
with cars," and moving swiftly through casual, but angst-tinged
observation--Taylor's second collection portrays people on the economic and
social fringes, from the "Old Soldier in the Park" ("his white hair flying/
against the green,/ a bird out of formation") to the pathetic story of
"Sleepy," about a mother who spots her son's face on a wanted poster.
Sometimes Taylor has a lighter touch ("the snow has no philosophy/ but to
fall for two days straight"), but he can also cross the line into
overstatement, as in his poem "A Witness," dedicated to the then-U.S. poet
laureate Robert Hass: "He had undertaken the job as caretaker/ to hios
country's eloquence, in charge/ of its rhymes, its superstitions/ in the
year of the most stars pitched/ most children abused." Finding no easy
answers, yet never letting his lyrical and painterly gifts spiral off into
irrelevance, Taylor remains true to his desire to get his world on paper, a
world of New York and beyond that continues to be inflected by his
Trinidadian roots: "He feels for a taste/ of his own flesh, he can smell it
all the time,/ cooking in the curry of a human dream."
>

I'll only add that about half the poems are set in Trinidad.


All three books are available from SPD. _Selected Shorter Poems_ and _The
Goat_ can also be ordered direct from Junction Press, PO Box 40537, San

great post, tisa;  "alternative" does tend to mean a certain alternative,
namely, an "experimental" style.  like "avant garde."  i've tried to argue
that "vanguard" could/should usefully be redefined as "coming from the
margins," but to no avail.  i get the tautological critique: what about
pound? what about olson?  he's avantgarde but not socially marginal.  in
vain i respond that that's not the vanguard i'm talking about --that for
me, it means "relative to the center"--any center, not just aesthetic.
there's a social vanguard.  how 'bout a Darkroom Collective reunion at the
next BoPoCo?

no mention of Laura Riding. The names

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The more important question in discussing the BoPoFest, each of which I
participated in, is ethnic inclusion. I haven’t done a scan like Dan
Bouchard did (ie: Boston, non-Boston) as per ethnicity, but the ratio has to
be -- at best -- in the 5:1 range.
I think it's like the cafeteria at college, where everyone sits in their
clicks, be it by color, ethnicity, sports team, yearbook or pep squad. The
idea of the other is so frightening, and the desire to learn of it so
far-fetched, that people - most anyhow - stick within their wee community. I
expect it of the masses, but not from the creative types, especially within
the confines of this event.
I think Aaron, as any organizer/editor does, myself included, represents the
work to which he has been exposed. When I mentioned getting Quincy Troupe
for next year’s conference, Aaron said, "Who?" But, Aaron is receptive to
new ideas, either asking for work by the recommended author or digging it up
himself, to see if it fits with his aesthetic for the conference - though
it's more a feel than a, ugh, aesthetic. To me, he said the former, so next
time I see him I'll pass him my copy of “Avalanche” or “Weather Reports.”

Be Good,
David

BLACK TAMBOURINE


Because I felt the boss suspected I resembled what I saw
I emptied those emotional outbursts, those tempests of passion,
and made a mistake my first five minutes in the white world.

I was shovelling horseshit the day they walked on the moon
telling myself there must be good white people, with money
and sensitive feelings, or had I been kept out of their world too long

ever to become a real part of it?  I longed to be among them, yet
when among them I looked at them as if I were a million miles away.
She gave me the ticket and I sat looking at the shadows on the screen.

By imagining a place where everything was possible, I kept love
alive in me, and got used to seeing the prostitutes sitting nude
around their rooms, though I'd steal sidelong glances at them.

Their nakedness startled me as would a blue vase or persian rug.
I was learning new modes of behavior in how to live the Jim Crow,
how to watch them, observe their every move, every expression,

how to interpret what little was said, and how much they left unsaid.
We went to the waterfront and sat on a knoll, watching the barges.
"I just won't let you eat out of a can in my house," she said.

(I was used to hunger and didn't need much to keep me alive.)
I am one of those who tried to conceal their plantation origin
from among the washerwomen who moaned and shouted hymns.

The invitation said:  "Tea and conversation.  A spacious view."
It was a harmless social gathering, or convocation of murderers.
They did not attach to words the same meanings that I did.

Impressed and intrigued by Lynn Miller's pieces on the List
of past couple or three weeks, a bit surprised no one else has
commented. Very different and daring it seems to me. What seems new
is how an over-drived analytical/historical bent exudes an odd and
compelling lyricism, though that suggests too much that the latter is
the byproduct of the former. Maybe it's the other way around, which
would make it more interesting, actually.
Whatever the case may be, I'm sure other people are noticing too.
Keep it moving, Lynn Miller, whoever you are.

first off (if you're
willing): explain how the facts could
distort so easily. the latest
tracking says
easily definable community
works against itself. it's
so obvious. the endless pressures make facts
funny. fielding questions day and
night: what's that about? is jumble
the tune of
expectation? yes, for now, those edges
will do. the hand holding makes circle:
get it? a clue to
your relief. container for the
thing contained: get it? pattern forms on a
hunch then the brittle twist which is
absolute importance
gains a voice. here's where the
career begins (not that
anyone listens), but don't
be afraid or
fall too quickly. you have
wiggle room. you've seen the
process exist in detail (it's
all about you). caution can steam thru
the neighbourhood, yelling ANY TRUCK
like a banshee, because
that's a belligerent image trying to
clock a world speed record. appropriate
what you need, no cops are
around, you have a
chance. you face open season on
the New Whatever but
why bother. too busy just
building the cannon, and the
shock of what it can kill
and why. inside out but throw away your
distress. it's a loveless
climate unless you reach the end of
the circle. that is, you hold hands.
the friendly name for this is
engagement. trickle down theories work
with sensational ease
and a hefty inventory. some day you'll
look back and see that
presence was charged, bigtime.
now it's a matter of equal rights for
equal pay, snappy
phraseologies against the
living dead. STRAIGHTEN UP, PROCESS SERVERS: the
theory is bound to get a wake up call
and you'll be pulled too. you like that
framework, bleeding poems with an eye on
the clock. being busy, you'll be
happy with any advice. the point
is to squeeze thru the
narrows, leap over the latest
log jam, ratchet up the
concern levels and
quickly churn the showdown. back and forth
with community standards, the best
cage you can imagine. that can't be
the final note because
kindness has to matter
as a gravity well. and it
will. Hell has been
conveniently shaved of doubt but
ignore that. the desperation begins
outside the charmed circle
before the map can be invented. that's why you
need not get gussied up. the vocabulary
has always been yours. what you
choose to throw off proves
what matters most. no
musical phrase can blanket that. you can
have your cannon now.

Jacques,

I would be interested to hear what you feel connects the
"homosexualization of the New York avant-garde"  with cut-up technique....
(beyond the fact that some gay guys did it....)

Hear Paul LaFarge read from his first novel, The Artist of the Missing
(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1999), about itinerant judges, fantastic cameras,
talking dolls, fish, the moon, and other topics of general interest.

When:  Thursday, August 12 @ 7:30 pm
Where: A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books
       601 Van Ness
       San Francisco, CA
       415.441.6670

"The visual details of Lafarge's novel are those of a stylish and somewhat
morbid cartoon. We have entered a metaphysical world where illogic rules
and whatever can be imagined is possible." (SF Chronicle)

"A poised and playful homage to the storytelling impulse... explores the
sort of shifting dreamscapes we encounter in Fellini, Borges and Lewis
Carroll." (New York Newsday)

"In The Artist of the Missing, San Francisco writer Paul LaFarge has built
a city for love stories, a place as dimly remembered as a midnight
telephone call, as broken and luminous as abandoned streets seenthrough a
whiskey tumbler." (San Francisco Magazine)

Would very much appreciate recommendations of

(1) A one-volume anthology of canonical (now) 19th Century French poetry
that has the French en face, and has, preferrably, plain prose translations?
(If not, maybe non-rhyming etc. translations?) Out-of-print OK.

(2) Favorite English/French en face editions of Baudelaire, Rimbaud,
Verlaine, Mallarme, Laforgue.

I'm looking for information about "Jacataqua" -- essay by William Carlos Williams in __In the American Grain__.  The piece touches on Aaron Burr's interaction during the Revolutionary War with the Abenaki Indians.  WCW describes the woman Jacataqua as an Abenaki "sachem" or chief, but I can find no other historical reference to her -- anybody know if she existed?  Thanks.

Being from Boston, this post caught my eye. I guess I'll say it flat out:
Boston
is the most racist place I've ever lived. Granted, I went from there to New
York
& on to San Francisco--so maybe Boston just looks bad by comparison. It all

seemed quite civilized on the surface: the neighborhoods were segregated
and everyone knew which lines not to cross. Maybe it's changed since I left

15 years ago, but I kind of doubt it.

Jeffrey Jullich <JJULLICH@CLAVEN.GSB.COLUMBIA.EDU> mentioned in
his survey
of Scandanavian poetry the line

        "He offers a smile, mild
/ as pick-axe handles a / mile wide which kindles/ the hide of rutabegas"

As a long-time fan of John Ashbery, I'm a little concerned that the
spelling of

        rutabagas

is getting abraded here. We don't have them in Australia -- we have
Swedes
and turnips, but not rutabagas -- but that's no reason to become careless
about our treasury of English spellings.

Anyone care to comment?
best,
        JT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OED lists 1799 as the earliest citation for "The new turnip, called
roota baga".  As "ruta-baga", it has appeared in poetry no less illustrious
than Shelley's (Oed. Tyr. 1. 47):

Hog-wash or grains, or ruta-bagas, none
Has yet been ours since your reign begun

later in poetry no less whimsical than Ogden Nash's 1951 "Family
Reunion":

We gobbled like pigs
On rutabagas and salted figs.

However, since ~brassica napus~ is also defined by the OED and the
Encyclopedia Brittanica as "the Swedish turnip" (see
http://www.eb.com:180/bol/topic?asmbly_id=15299 for a lovely
illustration of ~brassica rapa~), the name is originally derived from a
West Gotland dialect of Swedish, and perhaps we should be less
protectionist about "our treasury of English spellings": often vestiges of
an earlier etymology can resurrect in mispronunciations or deviant
spellings.


I'm distressed, though, that I cannot find a journal article I read on "Farm
Implements and Rutabagas", by Reva Wolf.  It appeared in a literary
journal that I chanced upon in our Periodicals Room, but now I can't
remember which.  If I remember correctly, she argues that there's a link
to an Andy Warhol painting with, I think, the word "rutabagas" in it, or
perhaps Popeye or some other element from the poem.  John disavowed
any connection or knowledge of the painting, but she prints a photograph
of a Thanksgiving dinner party where he is seated in front of the suspect
painting.

He was working at ~Art News~ at the time, and may have said that the
title came from a Dutch or Flemish canvas in a catalogue he was editing
at the time; but Reva Wolf again traces down the original to find that any
such Old Master was in fact titled "Farm Implements and ~Vegetables~ in
a Landscape", or such, so that his recounting of it was a double
invention: he may have revised the title of the Dutch canvas itself in that
catalogue.

I'm drawing on an imperfect memory of the article here, so if anyone
can help out with the proper Wolf citation, we could learn more about
those rutabagas.  I'm sure they're delicious with drawn butter.

I'm not from Boston, and, hell, as a Yankees fan in 1978 even owned a
"Boston Sucks" T-shirt, until my mother found out about it and made my
sister take it back, but geez, no matter how racist Boston may be --and I've
heard horror stories from many former residents, and, back to baseball, the
Red Sox were even the last team to integrate, Pumpsie Green in 1959, if
memory serves me right, a full 12 years after Jackie Robinson and Larry
Doby--but from the poetic community I know their isn't even a subtle form of
racism. None. Zip. Nada.
The ideas of neighborhoods being segregated and knowing the uncrossable
lines relates to just about any major metropolis, including San Francisco
and New York, each of which I've lived in, the latter for most of my live.
Instead, again, I think it's simply ignorance rather than racism, that at
times leads to non-diverse events and publications, sometimes even my own.
It takes an extra effort to be inclusive, be it simply through inquiry or
attending more ethnically and racially diverse reading series.
Be Good,
David

Irving,

If memory serves (and being at work without my books at hand, that's a
fairly large "if"), Samuel Delany has an essay on Greenberg in his _Longer
Views_ collection that explores some of the Crane connections. Dovetails
nicely, also, with the fictional treatment of Crane in his _Atlantis_.

>>> "Maria Damon (Maria Damon)" <damon001@MAROON.TCMN.EDU>
08/09/99 05:25pm >>> "alternative" does tend to mean a certain
alternative, namely, an "experimental" style.  like "avant garde."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all of these various commentaries on the use of the phrase
"alternative poetry"--- isn't this use of "alternative" derivative, though,
borrowed from the marketing of contemporary music?  It isn't as though
poets themselves had hatched this usage, the way "Vorticist" or such
may have been a genuine self-coined appellation. It's being patched in
from the language at large, where it already has its politicized functions.

In the NY area at least, there are radio stations, more and more actually,
which play what they call "alternative" rock; it's pretty much what used
to be called "punk", with a dash of occasional "metal."  I have the
impression that with "alternative music" the marketers use the word to
soften the scary edge they don't want to name: "punk."  And I would
suspect that, in its "pure" form, the same might be true of "alternative
poetry."

Where "avant-garde" or even "experimental" may have suggested
something contestatory, "defiant," or antagonistic to a status quo, the
danger with a term like "alternative" is that it makes things sound as
though these were arbitrary choices that one might wobble back and
forth between casually: Coke/Pepsi ideology.  It isn't dialectical anymore;
it's styled as a mere matter of taste and whim, that you can switch the
channel to "alternative" for a while if you get tired of mainstream, or
whatever.  Spice things up.

What is being elided is that an authentic "avant-garde" might actually be
meant as ~"subversive,"~ the concept of "revolutionary" art, that it is
seeking to change the whole rules of the game, and wasn't served up as
a diversion.  "Alternative," like "pluralistic," is a troublingly ~umbrella~
term, to my thinking: I thought Jacques' helpful postings correctly implied
that there are poets who are writing essentially normative and
conservative poetry, who are all too happy to slip under the tent skirts of
a bohemia, out of embarassment or plain obliviousness to their
"complicity" in perpetuating/reproducing things as they are, or for other
reasons.

In short, what I am trying to say is that "alternative" is a ~vanilla-izing~ of
something perhaps much more bitter and tonic than that.  Or, it is a
repackaging of (malgre lui) mainstream castaways who otherwise
would have been lost against the mainstream's more exclusionary
publishing odds.  The "radical" that has lost its fight becomes
"alternative."

Why ~can't~ a conference bill itself as "Subversive" or "Insurrectionist"?
The fading of that sensibility may have a lot to do with the latter
generational "directionlessness" that is also being discussed under this
Boston theme.

true as any shit can be: the
streets of Boston are racist. I
myself saw Mass Ave
act out. all the streets
have frat parties and
stupid central heating. the trees
in fair Boston are
sadly reluctant to
accept change. many
of the buildings
have issues. Boston Harbour
ignores castanets, Logan Airport
rolls over for thunder, the Fleet Centre is
where people die
deader than dead, and the arhythmic
parsimony of local names
rewards only the enclosed.
people aren't people
in any determined way
here. the things
in the sky
fall rapidly.
pity only exists far,
far to the west
because improvement is so
human. the tone of what
happened 15
years ago
broaches the new dynamics
of concern, totally
reeking of the
eternal blah blah
how's your stupid cat?
the Boston
Public Gardens has a
darkness that cannot be relieved
by mere rare questionable
sunshine. the tone
of every car is careless and
sour. don't ask about
any window, they are
ALL THE SAME. every shopping bag
contains an urge to
prepare a final draft. the word 'every'
is spoken every (hah!)
three seconds and
the books of Boston, each damn
hole of them,  are indented with indiscriminate
malice. purple haze is a river
kinder than the Charles.
John Coltrane came to
town and said QUIXOTIC while
angrily flipping the bird. Elvin
keeping time said
yeah. words choose new
routes here. no one (boxed redoubt) lives
true life, the geese say SUCK, the SWANS remove to
poetic realms, the pigeons indubitably
have no rest in the perfect
nest. the world is so
finely wrought in smallness
that every tallish
structure within the
city limits
bows to the stress-fractured
creeps who own the vocabulary
now and forever. and that
is how it is: one crowd is
always better than
another. expertise
wins. bonus points
when you supplicate to
the answer. smooth things
are marvelous.

The "guard/garde" in van- and avant- tend to do just that.  It's hard to
think of the words as having anything to do with "open"; they seem to work
against insistence.  Vanguard, at the front, standing along the curve,
bordering on, bordering from, in relation to the center of concentric
understanding, and bound by it until movement occurs, then starting over.
The ins and outs.

As I said in my post, I was one of the few, meaning three or four out of a
possible 15, experimenting writers within the DRC, so said content in the
Reading Series far outweighed that of the workshops/work produced.  While a
reunion of the DRC might be intriguing to some, its occurence at the next
Alt Bo Po conference would yield yet another thread like the one currently
being knotted here.

I did not mean to imply that Boston's poetry scene, or its poets, were
racist simply by living in a place with Boston's reputation.  The DRC & RS
came about out of lack, and to "break down the elitist aura surrounding
(Black) literary figures."  Bring 'em "home", make 'em accessible.  So
non-academic folks and academics could hear some poetry and meet the poets
without feeling unwelcome, undereducated, or too poor.  Much like, in
varying respects, the Poetry Project, or the Unterberg/Y series, or Small
Press Traffic, or what Aaron Kiely put together, or any other such thing
going on in this world.  Kiely created an event that made sense to him (and
who knows who declined for whatever reason to attend?), invited people he
knew, and will continue to expand and evolve as organizes future
conferences, as David  Kirschenbaum said.

What is intriguing to me, although it's great that he's open to
suggestions, is how he (or anyone) feels/thinks out the "alternative" in
Boston (or anywhere) and what kinds of writers/work will be encouraged by
the conferences, who will come and branch out, from the universities and
from the 'hoods.  Here alliances between Kiely, Lansing and Corbett could
yield much, but I think Kiely's vision, and support of it, to be more
important.  I echo Linda Russo here, and what I think Kevin Killian was
getting at.

There's got to be something to get to.   Where is that?  Home can work just
as well as anywhere, if one is comfortable there, of one's own making or
ad/a/o/ption.

Here I must point out that the quality of poetic life in Boston may simply
not sustain many for very long.  (why people leave places)  It can't be the
weather, which is just as bad if not worse in Buffalo.  So, Jacques, back
to curriculum/influence, or something.  Point(s) well taken.  I wish Alt Bo
Po the best, count Aaron as a burgeoning force to be reckoned with, and
hope to see for myself some day what happens there.

The ethnicity & innovation issue (together and separately) is about
inclusivity, but not ethnicity as alternative in and of itself.  Here, the
DRC references do not serve well.
Certainly there have been some changes since The New American Poetry, or
Gross & Quasha's Open Poetry, in which Black poets appeared together in the
back of the book, instead of within the categorical sections in which they
best fit, a move that at once showcased an impressive group of Black
experimentalists and relegated them to an unfortunate and historically
loaded space.  But certain blindnesses still persist.  Also too are the
refusals by mainstream of-color editors to include same experimentalists in
the publications they produce(d).  This cannot be ignored.

Also again, one must be seen to be part of the scene, be seen as part of
the scene and seen well once seen there, understood to fit.  (Back to Dodie
Bellamy's persona post).  It's easy to say that there are "no" or "few"
(blank) writers, but then, how does one know, in publishing, especially if
said writer doesn't dally with the usual signifiers in a recognizable way,
if at all, goes by a first initial and non-identifiably ethnically specific
last name, and/or if one doesn't show up on the scene?  What is happening
outside of the seen, and outside of the scene, and what does that
look/sound like?  How does physical presence come to be privileged over the
arrival of text in this regard?  This said specifically regarding
inclusion/exclusion and writers of color, but also as a general query on
the function of "centers", in this context.

Did you get used to words, using them?
The vast warehouse that the past is
if the past is not peripheral, like another
existence which was really ours--people

you have seen for a brief period of time
or even if only Once Upon a Time, at cafes
or bookstores or in houses you would never
set foot in again.  He belonged, then,

not to the circle he'd made a point of leaving,
since here he had a place and in the class
to which he belonged.  She must know
that he needed her to reject him, needed

that explosive charge to escape at all,
and everything depended on the velocity.
I let him luxuriate in the consciousness
of that insult, for such a chronicle I would need

a scale as large as life that came into view
with my pen.  His fanaticism about freedom
made any permanent intimacy with another
person impossible--the guilt he has forgotten

and yet fraternally into the soft or roaring
decimating an Expressionism as old as Art
itself and found whenever unregulated "e/motion"
outweighs reason, the pure subject, wilderness

of the Subjected and caught in the content
as real signs and as signs of something (humanly)
"real"--as us?  Or was all the philosophy
a philanthropy of the irrational which takes pity

on it and incorporates it into the philosopher
who bends over it?  I thought about it all day,
that what was intended in 1912-22,
how the high and low pressure systems

were stages of a single system and not
as separate as Ron put it in his temporary
instructions.  It sounds a lot more grand
when you announce a new system instead

of an innovation designed to "supplement"
the pre-existing one.  They weren't getting
enough pressure from the low-pressure line,
and how the high and low work together

is what I was working on in Works and Days.
The high pressure line pushes the vapors
but where?  The low pressure line follows
with a void, push and pull the whole principle.

It's like that concept of a backflush then purge
that you stumbled on in Louisville.
"It's basic," a worker told me in Illinois.
"You have to go in both directions."

Oh this is so stupid because I have a couple of programs that allow me to
send mail to myself so I thought I'd dredge up some memories of films I
made at UCLA in 1981-82; I decided to make a film a week, and that's how I
did films 1-37, all 16mm sound ranging from 3 minutes to probably 20 or so
- anyway I was reading Christian Metz at the time and thinking about ter-
rorism which is always relevant in LA and everywhere now, and I wrote
through this character called Dmitri at times, that wasn't his real name
- and there were phonecalls, "Hello Hello, It's Dmitri, yes, the package
has arrived," and I'd get the phone or Sung-Ja would but of course there
would be no one on the other end and the phone wouldn't ring at all or
maybe someone would say "ring ring" off-screen or even I'd say it before I
picked up the phone -

So here I am doing another short-circuit and wondering what will come of
it and surely here comes Dmitri and Julu and Nikuko dragged in from the
other worlds altogether, all of them in the space - of course there are no
bombs - our neighborhood has a "bomb-like record" - the World Trade Center
(WTC) bombing was planned in part a couple of blocks from here, and a
small cell was found in the other direction, a bout five blocks away,
working on blowing up the subway system, specifically the B train at the
Pacific Street stop (I take it all the time), because a lot of Jews took
it (which was news to me, time for reschedule) -

Anyway so here comes this incoming (shades of war, stealth technology,
bombers and fighters), and I make a dialog out of it - making sure that
there are the usual incompletions, spaces, edges to the text - difficult
to do in small texts - but it worked, using this small program, I'd just
type ./.mailme THE ACTION IS NEXT TUESDAY and it would arrive with the
Subject: THE set up, and the rest of the text following "in the body of
the message" - saved it/them altogether -

But it's a weakness of mine, this urgency, desperation - writing texts as
if they mattered, life-and-death-struggles, the last words spoken by the
last person on earth (it doesn't matter, no recipient, lost in the looped
black holes forever, router down! router down!) - but putting this/ that
package together took some time - maybe not enough - anyway you've seen
the results - do what you may with them - the content's not real - is
irreal - hyperreal - surreal - you can almost feel the trill of the rrr's
as everything gets ready to go off (that urgency again) - somewhere people
are being killed - you can count on it -

Plans as stupid as this collage - attempt at a text - idiocy, stupidity -
the bungle, the kludge ...

well, i gotta back karen up on this; being from boston (or rather newton,
the "golden ghetto" of the greater boston area) i can attest to the sharp
divisions in neighborhoods --more so than in SF or NYC.  however, there are
other forms of racism, such as in the Twin Cities where everything's
supposed to be so nicey nice.  the neighborhoods aren't as sharply divided,
but people are almost wilfully naive and want to deny difference wherever
they find it.

Thinking about all this talk of BoPo.  Wanted to cast my one vote of
encouragement to Jacques for taking on the difficult role of instigator -
essentially what he was saying was, hey, at the moment, this BoPo
space has trouble accomodating/engaging a poet like me - and I think
anytime a poet as intelligent and interesting as Jacques attempts to
make room for himself in a particular "scene" there’s at least an
opportunity for that scene to react/expand in such a way that it becomes
more interesting.  In any event, the result here has been some very
interesting posts, Brain Stefans’ among many others.  What seems to
have been established, though others may disagree, is that, for a variety
of reasons (and I doubt it owes much to any particular poet(s)’s malice)
some writers who attempt to interact with BoPo - those who take
language writing to be a major influence on their work, for instance, or
those writing out of a tradition where African-American
writers are front and center (and these are not mutually exclusive
categories) - have felt alienated from whatever there is of a Boston
scene.

Then again, there’s been the suggestion that there really *isn’t* a Boston
scene - certainly not a "school" - not necessarily a bad thing: trying
to write one’s poems as a fourth-generation NY Schooler or whatever
can’t be a whole lot of fun, confining (those of you doing this, or
putting "NY School" on your business cards, cease immediately!).  But
the idea that a critical mass of like-minded poets in Boston would simply
be stifling is a bad one. Likewise the idea that older writers within the
academy are simply courted for their "clout" by younger writers seeking
such clout.  Jacques is right when he says that this is mostly an
anti-academic
truism which, even if it’s valid in some cases, impedes potentially
valuable
relationships.

Jacques mentioned Bob Perelman’s role in the Penn/Philly poetry
community and I can say this, having been in that community for the
past five years: that when Bob got tenure at Penn many younger writers
I know were invigorated not because he would now have "clout" but
because this terrific poet with a lot to say would now probably be in
Philly for a long time, rather than, say, Santa Cruz. Folks well known
to this list like Steve Evans, Jennifer Moxley, Heather Fuller, etc, have
been kind in saying, Hey, there really is something interesting going
on in Philly - and I’m struck by how accidental that "something" was.
There was Bob.  Rachel Duplessis was at Temple.  Ron Silliman moved
to the area.  Gil Ott had been there as a buoy much longer than anyone.
These people weren’t a committee doling out prises for godssake, they
were poets with a lot of interesting, ideas, stories, and most of all
*poems*!
Tisa mentioned how the Dark Room Writers Collective, and the poets
they were interested in, were an enigma to most of the Boston poetry
community.  But for us, well, Gil had published Harryette Mullen’s
S*PeRM**K*T and MUSE & DRUDGE, so she was front and center
from the beginning, and what might discover many other great poets
(of color and otherwise) by considering Mullen’s work as a point in a
nexus and then fishing around for more points.

The Writers House at Penn came about and that was a space which
provided some cohesiveness - the space being more important than the
money for readings (which really wasn’t/isn’t that much, ask the people
who’ve read there!).  Louis Cabri had come to Penn already with a lot
of experience, poems, and knowing a shitload of people, and he started
PHILLY TALKS; I started COMBO; Kristen Gallagher started
HANDWRITTEN PRESS and a million other things. So there were
some forums which, as many of you have suggested along the
way, helped buoy whatever sense of community we had going.  And
things could be done: Louis's dueling writers in PT was taken as a
suggestion of who to pay attention to and who to read, etc, in addition
to being an event where ideas could be hashed out.  Lot’s of NY people,
D.C. people, Buffalo people coming through.  Kristen, Farah Griffin
and I interviewed Harryette for the first issue of COMBO and that was
my way of saying - hey, this is what/who we should be paying attention
to - likewise bringing Mackey, DiPalma to read.  But *everyone* did this.
Temple people were coming around, partly because Kerry Sherin, a grad
student at Temple, became director of Writers House.  Chris and Jenn
McCreary started doing IXNAY.  Kyle Conner and Greg Fuchs started
the Highwire Gallery reading series.

Then, there was Kristen Gallagher's insistence that Philly itself was
not to be ignored, that rather than lament that it wasn't NY or what
have you, we ought to *ground* ourselves in it - at least that's how I
was hearing her.  And this, for me anyway, opened up avenues
whereby things as diverese (or related?) as Philly's very underrated
(and inexpensive) jazz scene or the activities of the
Kensington Welfare Rights Union (with whom Kristen, Mytili
Jagannathan, and , again accidentally, or coincidentally, my wife)
could be treated as actions/activisms which might
mediate/integrate-with the symbolic action of poems.

Why am I saying all this?  It just seemed to me useful example in
contradistinction to the current situation in Boston.  In my own mind
right now it seems like there are maybe 25 poets or so in or connected
to Philly whose projects are quite various but who have enough in
common in terms of social and aesthetic views to want to be talking to
another and enough *differences* along these lines to keep that dialogue
*productive*.  And they have forums to support the dialogue.  So,
thinking of what Juliana Spahr said a while back about virtual
communities, even though I now live in Rhode Island, if I figured myself
as centered in any particular scene it would be the Philly scene, quite
happily, though like Jacques I hope to make a little room for myself
around
these northern parts and hope Helen Vendler goes to her final resting
place (Brookline?) to be replaced by Nate Mackey (Jacques might have
a different choice in this regard).  I say all this knowing that there are
many interesting poets in and around Boston but that a really hopping
community of poets - which, whatever anyone says, is a *good thing*
 is hard to come by and, as I say, pretty accidental.

-Mike.

Subject:      Village Voice POLYVERSE review
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Wednesday's Village Voice runs a lukewarm or even unfavorable
review of Lee Ann Brown's ~Polyverse,~ filled with gratuitous innuendo
about Language Poetry.  The reviewer is named Thad Ziolkowski.

He doesn't wait any longer than ~the first sentence~ to mention Charles
(Bernstein), who selected ~Polyverse~ for the "prestigious" New
American Poetry Series, and to begin casting veiled aspersions against
him.  We wouldn't have expected ~Polyverse~ as Charles' choice,
Ziolkowski says: we would have expected "ironic, warily analytical
work".  Charles, here cast as papal, bishopric, or censorious by
Ziolkowkski, should have been more likely to give ~that~ his "imprimatur".


Ziolkowski criticizes Brown, basically, as too much a patchwork quilt of
styles.  (An assessment which Sun & Moon's own amazon.com Book
Description is not, at a more positive slant, far afield from: "many forms
and possibilities.  Taking its cue from a wide range of modern and
postmodern poetics, Brown's work . . .")  ~Polyverse,~ he says, fails in
echoing New York School, Beat, and Language, without synthesizing
those influences. (Nor does Z. entertain the inkling that syncretism is not
the only solution, that the ~Poly-~ in ~Polyverse~ may actually mean
something, and that the segregated stylistics Brown leaves behind is
~more~ in tune with an aesthetic of polyvocalism.)

He finally treats this "thirtysomething" poet (his agism) as if, as I read it,
this were a beginner's problem that she will hopefully work out in time
("But then maybe the orgy among all these poetic influences is just
getting warmed up").

If it weren't for Brown eroticizing her Language-like "proliferation of
grammatical terms", Language Poetry by itself is just "lifeless automatic
pilot".

He accuses Brown of seeming "dated, frozen in a sunstruck New
York--circa-1965 atmosphere".  Oddly, it's her "references to Whitman,
Mayakovsky, Sappho and Stein" that Ziolkowski particularly singles out
as behind-the-times, but yet when he again cites her eroticism as "What
saves the book from this terminally reverent tendency", he quotes her
lines "She's a minor flirt,/a cloud in trousers" without so much as a blink
of open recognition that "a cloud in trousers", too, is yet another homage
and "reverent tendency" (O'Hara/Mayakovsky).  Ziolkowski is left looking
as if he doesn't know he was quoting an appropriation of Brown's, at
cross-purposes, and hence is in contradiction with himself by saying
that what saves the book from a debility is the same debility.

His attitude may reach its pique when he writes: "You end up wondering
. . . what's particularly new about this New American." Fair question.
Personally, I am left wondering, if he was this global in treating Brown ---
whom ("Brown is . . .  goofy in a troubadour-hippie-Fugs way") he
nonetheless seems to enjoy, despite his disparaging slant of praise ---
what kind of harsher polemic The Village Voice would have printed if the
book were indeed "ironic, warily analytical work".

What's up with Brooklyn poets' author bios saying they live in New York
City? Technically this is true, but, damn, as one born in Brooklyn, have
some pride in your borough.
I was at Coliseum Books by Columbus Circle here in Manhattan the other day
(the best new poetry selection this side of St. Marks Books) and found
titles by Chris Stroffolino and, I think, Ange Mlinko that say they live in
New York City (no one down here ever uses the distinction Manhattan when
referring to the borough).
A minor quibble, perhaps, but strange one would feel the need to identify
themselves as living elsewhere.

Be Good,
David

Having taken a few days or so to let this swirl in my mind I think that aside
from my annoyance at the previous blanket dismissal of the Festival----
----which did  its work ...there was good bad & lame by known & unknown
..(remember one of the featured west-coast readers going on for 45 minutes
when every one else was cutting back to a poem or two???) to wonderful
moments like Windy Kramer's or Dan Bouchard's reading (which show his work to
be Moving) Scalapino or Hejinian ...or Lease's short lovely burst or Gander's
or... or...or...
& having produced Word of Mouth on my own for ten years I know what Aaron K
does / did in setting all of this into motion & then getting the hell out of
the way....& just letting what ever happens happen

I return to my original post and this thought:
if we went through the whole weekend for nothing more than to have been there
for the Sat night read it was a memorable success... We were there - we
gathered together- we met each other (for some again) shared food poetry
and a remarkable set of readings

Now lets us return to the other thread running through here & that is the
"Boston" scene & then the whole concept of "scene"
 .

it was great to see the post on the DARK ROOM COLLECTIVE as there were many
many memorable events there... I often scheduled Word of mouth events so that
I could attend the darkroom.... They had a resident jazz band who were truly
fine & readers as diverse in their work as one could ask for.

Both the Blacksmith House reading series (no university affiliation)  and
Stone Soup (no university) (Gail Mazer & Jack Powers respectively),  have
continued for over two decades... when Bill Corbett was working with Gail the
series was inspired... & continually swirled differing poetries -both local &
international- together... Stone Soup has been the only truly open sign up
reading in continuous operation...

Gian Lombardo's DOLPHIN MOON series ran for years at the Cambridge YMCA
(unfunded- not university affiliated)

Joe Torra- in addition to working with me for a time at WoM held a very good
series of readings at his home...mostly locals or Providence/ Ny poets but
all with decent crowds as well as producing the run of lift & I have for
years now done in-home evenings . . .dinner & a reading for 10 or so & just
this past spring started the Oxford street talk series with Gerrit Lansing &
Diane di Prima  as the openers & this will as time goes on continue.

& then there is Word of Mouth which ran at Tapas for near  ten years &
continues in various forms...most recently in residence at Watersone's
Books...

in the decade at Tapas (which began in 87 but only started to really take
shape in March of 88 with the Duncan Memorial) I presented local & national
poets as well as Reading versions of Spicer's AFTER LORCA [87] A COMPLETE
CORRESPONDENCE - Olson, Corman, Creeley [88] Stein's TENDER BUTTONS & 4
SAINTS- an afternoon of S. Jonas films of LZ, RD, Wieners, OHara, Whalen,
Ginsberg, Olson etc. from the 66 NET series....
I met Corbett at the inception of the series he came & read for the opener
and he pushed readers my way for the entire time - & a wide variety of
same...in fact I can not imagine Word of Mouth existing without him; Torra I
first met there...via Ferrini who was and remains active here; Ange Mlinko
called me up one evening when Leslie Scalapino was reading.... & later that
year came on board to work with me .... Torra started the planning for lift
during a dinner (for Proust if memory serves) Ed Barrett [whose book COMMON
PRELUDES is a small wonder for many of us; Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno,
Patricia Pruitt, Dan Bouchard, Joe Lease, (another early meeting via Cid
Corman) Robert Pinsky, Askhold Melnyczuk [AGNI] & Lombardo who is now
producing a prose poem mag called KEY(SATCH)le, Gerrit Lansing was as he
remains a key source & frequent guest, Fanny Howe (a resident then). Gerald
Burns was a huge source & friend over the years he lived here & always pushed
the series.... the composer Eli Yarden, artists Katha Seidman & Ben Watkins &
renaissance Man Thorpe Feidt  -all contributed as they continue to do to the
scene...
There were readings by Blaser, Creeley, di Prima, Eshleman, Irby, Mackey,
Waldman, Gander, Elmslie, Drucker. . .I could go on & on see LINGO 7 [On
Boston] for a more extensive list; or for work from this scene as I see ia
portion of it see TALISMAN 16, (fall 1996).

The scene has ebbed and flowed as it continues to. if there is a center it
its the very lack of a center- which those I know best greatly enjoy. A large
number of us have no university affiliations at all (Torra & I both wait
tables for $$). & if there is a poetics (& I would argue that there is whilst
Torra or Corbett would be vehement that there is not) it is in the primacy of
the Work of the work.  Simply: either it is interesting or not- regardless of
its form. For me the currency is challenge & learning...i.e. am I /do I -
schools theories et al are meaningless. But the Work at work... that is the
center.... Poetry is the center. The scene is uneven...lacks uniformity & is
various in form... a cosmos.
If you need personalities with clout (I don't) there would be Corbett's
dinner table to supply sustenance ... from Auster to Cooledge to S Heaney to
Ashbery. Or there would be the figure of Guston...the example of his working
(see Corbett's Guston book).
Wieners, Olson, Lansing, Jonas, Blaser, Spicer, (all spent time here)  are
all claimed presences (and for me Duncan)

people, like poetries, come and go- as does energy. there are weeks when
nothing is happening and others when there is a reading to be at every night.

At Word of Mouth I was constant in greeting new faces and attempting to hook
people up... this is the function of a series as far as I am concerned.

anyhow all of this is to say that there was and is a scene here. It is a very
accessible scene for anyone who takes the time to attend the various events &
to actively participate.

[I am reminded here that I wrote to Cid Corman in 86 or so that I could not
get a reading here.. he told me to stop carping & start a reading series]

In my public work here I am keenly aware of the university presence ...& of
its very narrow leanings. This is nothing new. I am also aware that there is
another path (I invited Helen Vendler to speak at the Duncan Memorial as
indeed I should have... & she in turn should have spoken: But of that I have
no control . . . history will.

Again what is not here what ignores what is here is of no interest.

Each scene as each poem as each Theory is an ACT of creation. made up.
constantly remade & redefined & constant in its need for same. the rest you
can have.


Corbett says later in the lift interview:

 What are the poems ? What are we talking about, What are we looking at?

lets start here...




 Again the common bond between us is THE WORK  its creation and the daily
living that enables that work. I cannot say this too often.



 All best

PSS
this thought re the "obscenity riddled phone messages/calls.... as we all
stand huddled over the romance of  "a scene" we might do well to wonder in a
real way -as we recall those scenes of the past, if we could actually
tolerate the real of such. Jacques...can you imagine the call you might...
might???!!! WOULD have received from Spicer - had your comments addressed San
Francisco????  The caller that left an unidentified message should be cursed
-further- with writers block .... the "other caller" whose time and intimacy
accosted you... spoke out from what you mistake as a malaise

"expertise wins."

The one true thing anyone here has said about Boston so far--and the reason
why a so-called "alternative" poetry conference cannot have much impact.
Boston has seen, been, *is* poetry, alternative, and alternative to the
alternative--from Lowell to Plath, from Davidson to Heaney, from Pinsky to
Wolcott, from Henri Cole to Lucie Brock-Broido, from Patricia Smith to
Brother Blue, from every jam-packed Boston Globe Calendar with it's
incredible variety of poetry readings and happenings, to its intense
mega-doses of poetry workshops--in universities (BU, Harvard, MIT, BC), in
poets' homes, in the Cambridge Center for the Arts.  Not to mention all the
great and diverse poets who have lived, worked and continue to do so in
Boston colleges and surrounding suburbs. It's an incredible, beautiful,
electric, eclectic, intellectual and artistic environment with some of the
most breathtaking seasonal beauty in the country. If there is a better place
for real poetry to flourish I don't know about it. This will do fine for me.

mike,

there are single-author works a-plenty, good anthologies a little harder
to come by.

as to the latter, if you can scare up a copy of it at a secondhand store,
_An anthology of French poetry from Nerval to Valery in English
translation_ ed. angel flores (Garden City, N. Y., Doubleday, 1962) is
pretty good: the translations are in verse and if i remember right not
presented en face but gathered together in the back of the book.  they're
also done by a variety of translators and hence can be uneven.

baudelaire:
the two by-now standard editions are the one jackson and marthiel
matthews edited for new directions in the mid-fifties (multiple
reprintings, including a selected) and richard howard's edition for godine
in 1985.  the matthews' edition suffers, again, from some unevenness due
to its being a gathering of different translators' work.  howard on the
other hand tends to spiff baudelaire up too much for those who like their
baudelaire more ragged and soiled.  translations by arthur symons and the
george dillon-edna st.v millay collaboration are interesting more for
historical purposes.  i'd stay away from william h. crosby's edition for
boa, his insistence on metrical faithfulness forces him into some serious
padding.  another version that's cheap and reliable is the oxford world's
classics tr. james mcgowan.  but you asked about plain prose translations:
in which case, francis scarfe's edition for anvil in 1986 -- he does plain
prose translations at the bottom of the page.

rimbaud:
the penguin collected poems (tr. oliver bernard) also does plain prose
translations at the bottom of the page...

laforgue:
penguin has just brought out a laforgue that i havent read yet but also
hass plain prose at the bottom.  otherwise, the one i have and like a lot
is the peter dale translations publ. by anvil (1986)

verlaine:
a tougher case.  for a long time the only one you could find was the c.f.
macintyre versions put out by u.california press in the 1950s.  (and ditto
for his mallarme translations).  there's a new one from uchicago press,
tr. norman shapiro, that i've only seen but not read...

mallarme:
henry weinfeld's collected poems from ucal is a fine edition.  another
good one, tho again out of print, is the penguin edition w/ translations
by anthony hartley i think his name is.


happy hunting,
tom orange / wash,dc

I know my comment was sweeping, but I loved the city and it infuriated me
to hear the enervated "Pity there wasn't more diversity" tone to a couple
of the BoPo posts. The pervasive "gee, it's not *really* racism; it's
ignorance" response of many Bostonians (and yeah, I know, upstanding
citizens of other metropoli) makes me crazy. Somehow similar to the
politicians all making their "We must stop these random shootings that seem
to keep happening" speeches. Like, *duh.* These sentences have always let
the problem live; and lately it strikes me that they might actually be
serving as a kind of fertilizer.

I agree with most of what you say, Mike--especially about the Philadelphia
scene as a possible counterexample. But I don't agree that it has been
"pretty accidental." Some convergences are chances, to be sure; but most
of all it's all been consicous willed hard work (including, significantly,
your own). Your own Combo didn't just happen. It was to some perhaps
crucial degree "made possible" by a lot of things and conditions already
(by then) in place. Same with PhillyTalks, inventive as that project of
Louis' has been.

Yes, indeed Maria, I think you are spot on re "alternative" - the term
doesn't cut it for me either & I'd rather stay with the slew of slightly
gamy words like experimental, avant-garde, etc. I don't want an
"alternative" - because that leaves the original untouched, simply
suggesting something else of the same value, thus referring to taste, a fake
choice ( 40 different bagels to choose from, though all are made with the
same shitty flour, say). I want change, something, the world, the mind, to
be altered - or at least I need to be able to believe that such a radical
change is possible. "Alternative" is a shell-game for quick change
artists. -- Pierre

08/09/99 05:25pm >>> "alternative" does tend to mean a certain
alternative, namely, an "experimental" style.  like "avant garde."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------

With all of these various commentaries on the use of the phrase
"alternative poetry"--- isn't this use of "alternative" derivative, though,
borrowed from the marketing of contemporary music?  It isn't as though
poets themselves had hatched this usage, the way "Vorticist" or such
may have been a genuine self-coined appellation. It's being patched in
from the language at large, where it already has its politicized functions.

In the NY area at least, there are radio stations, more and more actually,
which play what they call "alternative" rock; it's pretty much what used
to be called "punk", with a dash of occasional "metal."  I have the
impression that with "alternative music" the marketers use the word to
soften the scary edge they don't want to name: "punk."  And I would
suspect that, in its "pure" form, the same might be true of "alternative
poetry."

Where "avant-garde" or even "experimental" may have suggested
something contestatory, "defiant," or antagonistic to a status quo, the
danger with a term like "alternative" is that it makes things sound as
though these were arbitrary choices that one might wobble back and
forth between casually: Coke/Pepsi ideology.  It isn't dialectical anymore;
it's styled as a mere matter of taste and whim, that you can switch the
channel to "alternative" for a while if you get tired of mainstream, or
whatever.  Spice things up.

What is being elided is that an authentic "avant-garde" might actually be
meant as ~"subversive,"~ the concept of "revolutionary" art, that it is
seeking to change the whole rules of the game, and wasn't served up as
a diversion.  "Alternative," like "pluralistic," is a troublingly ~umbrella~
term, to my thinking: I thought Jacques' helpful postings correctly implied
that there are poets who are writing essentially normative and
conservative poetry, who are all too happy to slip under the tent skirts of
a bohemia, out of embarassment or plain obliviousness to their
"complicity" in perpetuating/reproducing things as they are, or for other
reasons.

In short, what I am trying to say is that "alternative" is a ~vanilla-izing~
of
something perhaps much more bitter and tonic than that.  Or, it is a
repackaging of (malgre lui) mainstream castaways who otherwise
would have been lost against the mainstream's more exclusionary
publishing odds.  The "radical" that has lost its fight becomes
"alternative."

Why ~can't~ a conference bill itself as "Subversive" or "Insurrectionist"?
The fading of that sensibility may have a lot to do with the latter
generational "directionlessness" that is also being discussed under this
Boston theme.

all this talk of the city of my heart is very heartening.  i do not see
jacques as having cast aspersions but as having raised issues.  i see
tisa's post as crucial and i reiterate my suggestion to include a darkroom
collective reunion as a major part of next year's bopoco.  i like all the
posts weighing in from Filly, having just heard many encomia to the
Writers' House at the Bard Poetry and Pedagogy conference it sounds
dreamy...  this kind of thinking is terrific and seems like part of what
the LIST is for...generating debate about poetic communities and in the

Much enjoyed your posts re Boston poetry scene, Tisa.

But seem to have missed mention by anyone on this thread (correct me if I'm
wrong) of my favorite of the long departed Boston poetas: Stephen Jonas,
killed by smack, or Boston, in the mid-sixties. Is he still being read? Or
forgotten despite Joe Torra's work? I'm pretty sure Torra's selected Jonas
from Talisman is still in print.-- Pierre

 The "guard/garde" in van- and avant- tend to do just that.  It's hard to
think of the words as having anything to do with "open"; they seem to work
against insistence.  Vanguard, at the front, standing along the curve,
bordering on, bordering from, in relation to the center of concentric
understanding, and bound by it until movement occurs, then starting over.
The ins and outs.
As I said in my post, I was one of the few, meaning three or four out of a
possible 15, experimenting writers within the DRC, so said content in the
Reading Series far outweighed that of the workshops/work produced.  While a
reunion of the DRC might be intriguing to some, its occurence at the next
Alt Bo Po conference would yield yet another thread like the one currently
being knotted here.
I did not mean to imply that Boston's poetry scene, or its poets, were
racist simply by living in a place with Boston's reputation.  The DRC & RS
came about out of lack, and to "break down the elitist aura surrounding
(Black) literary figures."  Bring 'em "home", make 'em accessible.  So
non-academic folks and academics could hear some poetry and meet the poets
without feeling unwelcome, undereducated, or too poor.  Much like, in
varying respects, the Poetry Project, or the Unterberg/Y series, or Small
Press Traffic, or what Aaron Kiely put together, or any other such thing
going on in this world.  Kiely created an event that made sense to him (and
who knows who declined for whatever reason to attend?), invited people he
knew, and will continue to expand and evolve as organizes future
conferences, as David  Kirschenbaum said.
What is intriguing to me, although it's great that he's open to suggestions,
is how he (or anyone) feels/thinks out the "alternative" in Boston (or
anywhere) and what kinds of writers/work will be encouraged by the
conferences, who will come and branch out, from the universities and from
the 'hoods.  Here alliances between Kiely, Lansing and Corbett could yield
much, but I think Kiely's vision, and support of it, to be more important.
I echo Linda Russo here, and what I think Kevin Killian was getting at.

There's got to be something to get to.   Where is that?  Home can work just
as well as anywhere, if one is comfortable there, of one's own making or
ad/a/o/ption.
Here I must point out that the quality of poetic life in Boston may simply
not sustain many for very long.  (why people leave places)  It can't be the
weather, which is just as bad if not worse in Buffalo.  So, Jacques, back to
curriculum/influence, or something.  Point(s) well taken.  I wish Alt Bo Po
the best, count Aaron as a burgeoning force to be reckoned with, and hope to
see for myself some day what happens there.
The ethnicity & innovation issue (together and separately) is about
inclusivity, but not ethnicity as alternative in and of itself.  Here, the
DRC references do not serve well.
Certainly there have been some changes since The New American Poetry, or
Gross & Quasha's Open Poetry, in which Black poets appeared together in the
back of the book, instead of within the categorical sections in which they
best fit, a move that at once showcased an impressive group of Black
experimentalists and relegated them to an unfortunate and historically
loaded space.  But certain blindnesses still persist.  Also too are the
refusals by mainstream of-color editors to include same experimentalists in
the publications they produce(d).  This cannot be ignored.
Also again, one must be seen to be part of the scene, be seen as part of the
scene and seen well once seen there, understood to fit.  (Back to Dodie
Bellamy's persona post).  It's easy to say that there are "no" or "few"
(blank) writers, but then, how does one know, in publishing, especially if
said writer doesn't dally with the usual signifiers in a recognizable way,
if at all, goes by a first initial and non-identifiably ethnically specific
last name, and/or if one doesn't show up on the scene?  What is happening
outside of the seen, and outside of the scene, and what does that look/sound
like?  How does physical presence come to be privileged over the arrival of
text in this regard?  This said specifically regarding inclusion/exclusion
and writers of color, but also as a general query on the function of
"centers", in this context.

There's a difference in addressing a situation and rectifying it. Is someone
who simply doesn't know until turned on, such as myself, just a decade ago,
toward a poet as "known" as Ferlinghetti, not simply ignorant? Once
introduced, though, the burden is all in the newbee's hands. Race, in this
context, simply doesn't enter into the equation. Statements do, as you say,
simply let the problem live, but only if that's all they are, yet another
editorial assailing the system, without proposing a route toward change.
If something is to be attacked, it's an education system that introduces
poetry through memorization and recitation of a certain group of long-dead
white males, with a few token females and people of color sprinkled in for
diversity's sake. Here's where the racism is quite often full-throttle. It's
no wonder most of us are ignorant of some corner of this vast library.

Be Good,
David

RE: well, i gotta back karen up on this; being from boston (or rather

I am also from Newton (the "golden ghetto" )and got used to running into
people who thought I was rich. But you should know better, as do I: Newton
is comprised of many Newtons: Newton Center, Newtonville, West Newton,
Newton Highlands, Newton Upper Falls, Newton Lower Falls, THE LAKE (!!),
Chestnut Hill, etc, etc. --it is one of the most economically diverse
suburbs in Boston, if not THE most diverse. Yes, it is chock-full of lawyers
and psychiatrists (Newton Center has the highest number of psychiatrists per
sq mile in the country) and the "new" high-tech rich, but just a few miles
away in any direction are the working class and blue collar people. Artists
and writers also flourish there--it's close to the city and also has a
lively arts scene of its own.

If by "sharp divisions" in neighborhoods, you mean racially unmixed
neighborhoods, well, when I was growing up there it was not
racially/ethnically mixed--but no suburb that far away from the city was.
Now it is though. If you don't believe me, take a trip down Washington
Street from West Newton to Newton Corner, or drive through some
neighborhoods next time you're there.

Thanks for listing out all of the Boston poetry scenes you remember.
Blacksmith House is a great place--also Tapas (was) and Waterstones (was).
Don't forget Trident Cafe and Ploughshares in Cambridge--and yes, Stone Soup
has been around for ages (T.T. The Bear's is another "get up and read your
stuff" venue). MIT has been sponsoring some great readings lately, and, of
course, Harvard. I personally don't buy into the idea that only
academia--or, only NON-academia--is the "real" place of poetry. It's
everywhere. I agree with you completely that:

"...the Work at work... that is the center.... Poetry is the center. The
scene is uneven...lacks uniformity & is various in form... a cosmos."

I would not wish it otherwise.

Yes, yes - absolutely.  I didn't mean to imply that what's going on in
Philly is all just happenstance.  Sorry if I did.  No, I mean, the effort
on the part of so many people - the hours and concentration devoted - have
been incredible.  I suppose my musing on its "accidental" nature had more
to do with the ways of the universe (a fuzzy sense that it could easily
have happened otherwise or not at all) than with an accurate attempt to
describe how the community *happened*.  While I'm here again, I'll say
that, anti-academicism aside, there were professors at Penn and Temple who
got behind Writers House and the philly poetry scene generally early and
forcefully, most notably Al himself, but also Bob Lucid, Greg Djanikian,
Herman Beavers, Farah Griffin (Herman, being the one, incidentally, who
introduced me to Mackey's work).  I should say too that Writers House has
never been just a poetry venue but is enaged in all sorts of writing and
social intiatives and is open to the public, which makes it all the more
valuable as a place for poets.    -m.

Subject:      Re: get the wagons ina circle: re BOSTON

Michael,
Thank you, you nailed it, summed it up, reminded me that I met Fanny Howe and
her daughter Lucien at Word of Mouth.  And about the many readings I attended
at Blacksmith House, everything you mentioned I remember.

Things get distant....

I'm feeling very appreciative right now, and almost, almost, homesick.  (winter
drove me out, not memories of driving through Southie at night...)

This is fast; gotta eat!

More....fun....


<pre>
Having taken a few days or so to let this swirl in my mind I think that aside
from my annoyance at the previous blanket dismissal of the Festival----
----which did  its work ...there was good bad & lame by known & unknown
..(remember one of the featured west-coast readers going on for 45 minutes
when every one else was cutting back to a poem or two???) to wonderful
moments like Windy Kramer's or Dan Bouchard's reading (which show his work to
be Moving) Scalapino or Hejinian ...or Lease's short lovely burst or Gander's
or... or...or...
& having produced Word of Mouth on my own for ten years I know what Aaron K
does / did in setting all of this into motion & then getting the hell out of
the way....& just letting what ever happens happen

I return to my original post and this thought:
if we went through the whole weekend for nothing more than to have been there
for the Sat night read it was a memorable success... We were there - we
gathered together- we met each other (for some again) shared food poetry
and a remarkable set of readings

Now lets us return to the other thread running through here & that is the
"Boston" scene & then the whole concept of "scene"
 .

it was great to see the post on the DARK ROOM COLLECTIVE as there were many
many memorable events there... I often scheduled Word of mouth events so that
I could attend the darkroom.... They had a resident jazz band who were truly
fine & readers as diverse in their work as one could ask for.

Both the Blacksmith House reading series (no university affiliation)  and
Stone Soup (no university) (Gail Mazer & Jack Powers respectively),  have
continued for over two decades... when Bill Corbett was working with Gail the
series was inspired... & continually swirled differing poetries -both local &
international- together... Stone Soup has been the only truly open sign up
reading in continuous operation...

Gian Lombardo's DOLPHIN MOON series ran for years at the Cambridge YMCA
(unfunded- not university affiliated)

Joe Torra- in addition to working with me for a time at WoM held a very good
series of readings at his home...mostly locals or Providence/ Ny poets but
all with decent crowds as well as producing the run of lift & I have for
years now done in-home evenings . . .dinner & a reading for 10 or so & just
this past spring started the Oxford street talk series with Gerrit Lansing &
Diane di Prima  as the openers & this will as time goes on continue.

& then there is Word of Mouth which ran at Tapas for near  ten years &
continues in various forms...most recently in residence at Watersone's
Books...

in the decade at Tapas (which began in 87 but only started to really take
shape in March of 88 with the Duncan Memorial) I presented local & national
poets as well as Reading versions of Spicer's AFTER LORCA [87] A COMPLETE
CORRESPONDENCE - Olson, Corman, Creeley [88] Stein's TENDER BUTTONS & 4
SAINTS- an afternoon of S. Jonas films of LZ, RD, Wieners, OHara, Whalen,
Ginsberg, Olson etc. from the 66 NET series....
I met Corbett at the inception of the series he came & read for the opener
and he pushed readers my way for the entire time - & a wide variety of
same...in fact I can not imagine Word of Mouth existing without him; Torra I
first met there...via Ferrini who was and remains active here; Ange Mlinko
called me up one evening when Leslie Scalapino was reading.... & later that
year came on board to work with me .... Torra started the planning for lift
during a dinner (for Proust if memory serves) Ed Barrett [whose book COMMON
PRELUDES is a small wonder for many of us; Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno,
Patricia Pruitt, Dan Bouchard, Joe Lease, (another early meeting via Cid
Corman) Robert Pinsky, Askhold Melnyczuk [AGNI] & Lombardo who is now
producing a prose poem mag called KEY(SATCH)le, Gerrit Lansing was as he
remains a key source & frequent guest, Fanny Howe (a resident then). Gerald
Burns was a huge source & friend over the years he lived here & always pushed
the series.... the composer Eli Yarden, artists Katha Seidman & Ben Watkins &
renaissance Man Thorpe Feidt  -all contributed as they continue to do to the
scene...
There were readings by Blaser, Creeley, di Prima, Eshleman, Irby, Mackey,
Waldman, Gander, Elmslie, Drucker. . .I could go on & on see LINGO 7 [On
Boston] for a more extensive list; or for work from this scene as I see ia
portion of it see TALISMAN 16, (fall 1996).

The scene has ebbed and flowed as it continues to. if there is a center it
its the very lack of a center- which those I know best greatly enjoy. A large
number of us have no university affiliations at all (Torra & I both wait
tables for $$). & if there is a poetics (& I would argue that there is whilst
Torra or Corbett would be vehement that there is not) it is in the primacy of
the Work of the work.  Simply: either it is interesting or not- regardless of
its form. For me the currency is challenge & learning...i.e. am I /do I -
schools theories et al are meaningless. But the Work at work... that is the
center.... Poetry is the center. The scene is uneven...lacks uniformity & is
various in form... a cosmos.
If you need personalities with clout (I don't) there would be Corbett's
dinner table to supply sustenance ... from Auster to Cooledge to S Heaney to
Ashbery. Or there would be the figure of Guston...the example of his working
(see Corbett's Guston book).
Wieners, Olson, Lansing, Jonas, Blaser, Spicer, (all spent time here)  are
all claimed presences (and for me Duncan)

people, like poetries, come and go- as does energy. there are weeks when
nothing is happening and others when there is a reading to be at every night.

At Word of Mouth I was constant in greeting new faces and attempting to hook
people up... this is the function of a series as far as I am concerned.

anyhow all of this is to say that there was and is a scene here. It is a very
accessible scene for anyone who takes the time to attend the various events &
to actively participate.

[I am reminded here that I wrote to Cid Corman in 86 or so that I could not
get a reading here.. he told me to stop carping & start a reading series]

In my public work here I am keenly aware of the university presence ...& of
its very narrow leanings. This is nothing new. I am also aware that there is
another path (I invited Helen Vendler to speak at the Duncan Memorial as
indeed I should have... & she in turn should have spoken: But of that I have
no control . . . history will.

Again what is not here what ignores what is here is of no interest.

Each scene as each poem as each Theory is an ACT of creation. made up.
constantly remade & redefined & constant in its need for same. the rest you
can have.


Corbett says later in the lift interview:

 What are the poems ? What are we talking about, What are we looking at?

lets start here...




 Again the common bond between us is THE WORK  its creation and the daily
living that enables that work. I cannot say this too often.



 All best
Michael Franco


PSS
this thought re the "obscenity riddled phone messages/calls.... as we all
stand huddled over the romance of  "a scene" we might do well to wonder in a
real way -as we recall those scenes of the past, if we could actually
tolerate the real of such. Jacques...can you imagine the call you might...
might???!!! WOULD have received from Spicer - had your comments addressed San
Francisco????  The caller that left an unidentified message should be cursed

12 August 1999

The William Blake Archive <http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> is
pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions of copies
B and U of Blake's _Songs of Innocence__.

Copies B and U are a study in contrasts, yet both are from the earliest
printings of this book. Copy B, now in the Rosenwald Collection, Library
of Congress, was printed with fifteen other copies of _Innocence_ in
1789, four of which were later joined with _Experience_ impressions,
printed in 1794, to form _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_ copies
B, C--which is in the Archive--D, and E. Unlike many of these early
copies of _Innocence_, copy B still consists of all 31 plates originally
composed and executed for _Innocence_. Like them, however, it was
printed in a raw sienna ink on 17 leaves and exemplifies Blake's early
printing and coloring style. The plates were wiped of their plate
borders, the illustrations very lightly washed in watercolors, and the
texts left unwashed. This mode of presentation, along with printing both
sides of the leaves to create facing pages, emphasized the prints as
book pages rather than prints or paintings. Good examples of printing
and coloring illuminated plates to look like minatures can be seen in
_Songs_ copy Z, also in the Archive.

_Innocence_ copy U, from the Houghton Library, Harvard University, is an
excellent example of printing illuminated plates to look like prints.
Like etchings and engravings, they were printed on one side of the leaf
in black ink and left uncolored. Copy U, which was printed with untraced
copy V, had been dated c. 1814, because of some stylistic similarities
it shares with illuminated works assumed to have been produced around
that time. But, in fact, copy U is the _first_ copy of _Innocence_
printed. The presence of a unique first state for "Infant Joy" proves
this sequence; the bottom part of the "J" in the title is missing in all
extant impressions, but here it extends into the flower. Copy U was
printed before copy B and all other early copies; the ink color,
printing style (recto only), and lack of hand coloring suggest a date of
printing before Blake had developed his special ways of producing his
illuminated books and instead repeated styles and techniques long
familiar to him as a commercial engraver.

Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5"
transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images
and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our
previous updates.

With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 35
copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
_Jerusalem_ (forthcoming).

Some time ago there was a thread of thought about words lost and found, and a
cluster of posts around this, to which I'd like to contribute the following
image-text found yesterday poking around the German stacks looking for Rosa
Luxemburg's Politische Schriften vols. 1-3 at the Cleveland Public Library:

Cover Image:    Two what appear to be golden retriever puppies surrounded in
a field of flowers lifting (pointing) their paws toward a baby bunny rabbit.
Cover Text: Crown Point Graphics / Carmel, IN 46032 NC 763 "Pansy Patrol"
(Original Art Work by Diane Querry / Litho Canada.

Inside this card is the following handwritten message:

"Write to me:
Olessya Dianova
Str. Sortavalskya, x(The same mistake twice, but this means nothing)5/2-160
Petrozavodsk, RUSSIA 185026"

[Several quickly dashed lines resembling strands of hair separate the address
from the message]

"My address is on the envelope as well.  There are the pictures of you when
we we in Guptols.  Should have given you one of xxme But I completely forgot,
I'll send it to you later.  Bye!  Let's both have xxsave trips.

Dear Naomi!

Sorry we couldn't see each other again Before we both leave, But I'll
remember all the fun times we had spent together Hope you'll have a safe trip
to Ohio, and school there will help you to Become the greatest musician ever.
 Don't forget to send me the copy of the novel when you finish it.  I am
gonna miss you.

[hand-drawn heart]Olessya"

Inside the card is a snapshot of the "greatest musician ever":  hair falling
well below her shoulders, wearing a blue flower print sleeveless blouse and
jean shorts.  A small purple coin purse hangs from a strap around her neck.
Her full smile into the camera appears only casually posed, and her eyes
reflect that red glare that happens with flashbulbs.  A couple of Russian
letters from a billboard or shop sign are all that glimmers through the
pitchblack backdrop.

Finders keepers.  Losers weepers.

I'd like to nominate these two click chicks as honorary (allegorical)
Armandistas, after the spirit of the Armand among many others that emerges in
the pages of some recent scholarship in the U.S.:

Jane McDermid & Anna Hllyar, WOMEN AND WORK IN RUSSIA 1880-1930 (Longman,
1998)
Barbara Evans Clements, BOLSHEVIK WOMEN (Cambridge University Press, 1997).
Barbara Evans Clements, DAUGHTERS OF REVOLUTION (Harlan Davidson, Arlington
Heights, Illinois, 1994)
Clements, Engel and Worobec, eds., RUSSIA'S WOMEN (University of California
Press, 1991)

The history being written here locates a feminism with the Bolshevik party
that appears to have shared, in the thinking behind a project like Zhenotdel,
which at first glance anyway appears to bear some resemblance to the literacy
campaign conducted in Cuba in the early 60s, with Luxemburg's (mistaken?)
view that "the revolutionary party should come much closer to encompassing
the organized working class in its entirety."  (Editor's introduction to Rosa
Luxemburg Speaks, i.e. "From the whirlwind and the storm, out of the fire and
flow of the mass strike and the street fighting, rise again, like Venus from
the foam, fresh, young, powerful, buoyant trade unions.")  The feminism that
developed through an educational project like Zhenotdel and a newspaper like
Rabonitsa (Working Woman) declared itself on the side of the working class
and oppressed nationalities in pre-revolutionary Russia from within an
organization whose legendary combative intransigence has perhaps overshadowed
other strands of thought and activity which that organization was apparently
able to accomodate, if not encourage and promote.

Another Baudelaire en face edition is _Les Fleurs du Mal et Oeuvres
Choisies_/_Flowers of Evil and Other Works_, a Dover edition, copyright
1992, translated by Wallace Fowlie. It was originally a Bantam book, first
published in 1963 or 1964. Fowlie's translations are *okay*, but a little
pretentious. Then again, he wrote a book called, _Rimbaud and Jim Morrison:
The Rebel as Poet_. Stop laughing. Anyway, the book. It's a purple and
yellow atrocity, I picked it up at a Barnes and Noble book annex a few years
ago. Some of my NYU French department colleagues had it, too, not sure if
it's Baudelaire standard or just secret among a few of us. It's better than
the Matthews edition, I think, but that may just be bias toward Fowlie's
ultra-impressive endnotes.

Apologies for cross posting.

Here are some recent titles. I'll give a bare list first, then details
below. All the books are hand sewn, with an illustrated card cover, and
printed on a deskjet. (The cover for Holding Patterns is by Tom Raworth.) I
dislike superlatives, so have confined myself to simple remarks on form
followed by a quotation from the relevant book. (I suspect the formatting
of the quotes will be a little mangled by e-mail.) This should not be read
as a lack of enthusiasm on my part. Making books by hand is a labour of
love and one needs to be absolutely mad about a book to do it. In the case
of these books I am.

As with every other poetry press that ever was, your support is sorely
needed would be very much appreciated. Visa/Mastercard accepted. Those
outside Ireland/UK please contact me to sort out postage.
A bulk price can be arranged for anyone wishing to really treat themselves.

Antigone was a beached heiress intent
on returning Gilligan to his life
of suburban haplessness 'til the speech
coach knocked off her tongue (which
was never mother) and syllables entered
stage below like steam from Chilean
baths, assumptions chilled as a corps
of Marines building bridges over
crossed rivers. Too much thought
stifles paralysis, don't you think,
enabling mental blocks to walk planks.
I heard the splash, never associating
it with fundaments of faith, the aegis
that sounds like Jesus, forbidden
conclusiveness in the name of a better
or more bitter) ending for his readers'
response. Drug store cushions absorb
more shock than that; headphones lifted
by athletes contain less music
than foreplay of static, sound
becoming something more or less like
guilty silence. Redeem your pawns
at the door, for all exchange is not
inheritance, these angled communiqués
borne out in bottles hijinxed by ships
that carry human cargo until carcasses
recall Carcassone and history returns
as a mare running ovals, straitlaced
executives turning holidays into hectares
of dubious proclivity, not knowing one
agenda to triumph when waterfalls vanish
in valleys where the air is admonishment.

dear Jeffrey Jullich

that phrase that thad uses to describe bernstein's supposed wants ("ironic,
warily analytical work") might be more applicable to thad's own book, my son
the arsonist.  maybe thad was bummed charles didn't pick him.

i guess i mean i didn't find the review all that negative.

BillL

<<Wednesday's Village Voice runs a lukewarm or even unfavorable
review of Lee Ann Brown's ~Polyverse,~ filled with gratuitous innuendo
about Language Poetry.  The reviewer is named Thad Ziolkowski.

He doesn't wait any longer than ~the first sentence~ to mention Charles
(Bernstein), who selected ~Polyverse~ for the "prestigious" New
American Poetry Series, and to begin casting veiled aspersions against
him.  We wouldn't have expected ~Polyverse~ as Charles' choice,
Ziolkowski says: we would have expected "ironic, warily analytical
work".  Charles, here cast as papal, bishopric, or censorious by
Ziolkowkski, should have been more likely to give ~that~ his "imprimatur".>>

--Mark Prejsnar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------------
Mark,

Although I don=27t know what Jacques=27 answer would be to that question, =
. . . I would like to agree with him about =22the dangers of historical =
decontextualization=22, and that, to name as he did only Burroughs, Cage, =
and Ashbery, =22homosexualization=22 is significant for the invention of =
cut-ups.  Personally, I=27ve already had a similar impression concerning =
the =22homosexualization=22 of Warhol=27s, Johns=27, and Rauschenberg=27s =
appropriations, in relation to the genesis of Pop. (Not to forget: the =
theoretics of cut-ups=27 historical period were also hothouse to =22Notes =
on Camp,=22 whose own =22homosexualization=22 treated sexuality and art =
style as self-evident equivalents. ) Why I feel that way, though, may be =
thin ice to explain.=20

I take it from your (supportive) tone that you mean your question to be =
=7Ein defense=7E of those =22gay guys=22, . . . as though Jacques=27 =
telescoping of the period into one =22-ization=22 were presumption, like =
talking =22Velvet Mafia=22 or shortchanging heterosexualized contemporaries=
.  But at the same time I=27d like to submit that your =22beyond the fact =
that some gay guys did it=22 may have a trivializing casualness about it, =
. . . as though there were always =22gay guys=22 around, as it seems =
nowadays, and no less than three all at once independentally but coincident=
ally being instrumental in the creation of a new art form were at best =
some statistical fluke. As though the branding iron of idiosyncratic =
desire did not leave its stamp on art.  Back to =22historical decontextuali=
zation=22: those three were still of a generation which couldn=27t yet =
even be =7Enamed=7E as =22gay=22, so their consensus in all engineering =
this same new art form into being is to the contrary rather remarkable.  =
If a new genre were to emerge from a similarly exclusionary group of, say, =
Jews, ---or =7Elesbians=7E rather than =22guys=22=21 =AF it might be more =
striking and appear instantly sensible for someone to begin one of those =
typical explorations of Jewish Mysticist antecedents, or such.

That said, let me get myself into more hot water by attempting to explain =
the parallel I find between the Warhol-Johns-Rauschenberg =22homosexualizat=
ion=22 and Pop, and between the Burroughs-Cage-Ashbery =22homosexualization=
=22 and cut-ups.  Proviso: I may be confusing psychology for ontology, and =
I=27m almost definitely erring into what Jacques warns against as =
=22analogical . . .  significance.=22  (However, given the metaphoric =
nature of =22historical contextualization=27s=22 hidden similes themselves,=
 some tropological thinking seems allowable.)

Here=A2s the point:

The xerox-like image transfer methods (silk screening) of the Pop artists  =
=7Ereproduced=7E images without devising new ones; similarly, that graphic =
form has its literary equivalent in cut-ups, which also, if not per se =
reproducing, re-=7Earrange=7E a pre-existing text without introducing new =
matter.

The (perhaps heretically naive) link my mind draws is---to =7Ebiological=7E=
 reproduction, or procreation.  (There is some slippage of terms here, as =
we use the word =22reproduction=22 for both productive biological =
parturition and the =7Enon-productive=7E =22mechanical reproduction=22 we =
know since Benjamin.)  To blurt it out---the figure of the homosexual is, =
in biological terms, non-productive (non-reproducing), and the =22homosexua=
lization=22 artwork of those cut-up/Pop progenitors was also non-productive=
 (=22reproduction=22).  If we suspend disbelief and try to re-imagine from =
the perspective of those =2750=27s art climate, =22original=22 creation =
would have been seen as an indispensable criterion of =7Ea man=27s=7E art.

The necessary absurdity that I=A2m figuring into this logic is the cliche =
that =22an artwork is like a child to the artist=22; and I am of course =
assuming for the sake of this stereotyped argumentation the fallacy of the =
=7Echildless=7E homosexual, a fallacy which, however, in the case of these =
particular six artists named in the =22homosexualization=22, happens to =
hold true (perhaps not accidentally).

Hence---I suppose another way of putting this (increasingly embarassing) =
notion is that: the homosexual does not =7Eadd=7E to the world.  (Although =
an unpalatable axiom, and patently objectionable on the level of the real, =
it seems fair to assert in the spirit of dogma such as =22Ce sexe qui =
n=27est pas un=22 or other post-modern metaphysics.)  In these terms, the =
=22gay guys=22 behind cut-ups and Pop reproduction, despite their =
incontestable contribution, did not =7Eadd=7E to the world or the bulk of =
existing imagery/text in the same way that a work of =22original=22 =
production takes up space.  (=7EEurope=7E had =22really=22 not added =
anything to =7EBeryl of the Biplane;=7E it=27s commutative, not additive.)

As far as cut-ups=27 earlier larval stage of =7Ecollage,=7E I believe =
Wayne Koestenbaum has commented on the sublimated male-male =22bonding=22 =
that Picasso and Braque acted out in its invention and manufacture =
(Koestenbaum, =7EDouble Talk: The Erotics of Male Literary Collaboration,=
=7E which should perhaps be required reading in relation to =22beyond the =
fact=22: same-sex literary collaboration may =7Ealready=7E be an a priori =
=22homosexualization,=22 regardless of the participants=27 actual sexual =
preference, according to Koestenbaum=27s thesis).


I hope this doesn=27t seem like Pound on Social Credit.  I mean it as =
Queer Theory,---which is always speculative.

I have to say I've always loved Boston, with all its grimy problems. But I
think I know a different Boston. Cambridge, for one, the working-class part
where my friends live (away from Harvard Square), is thoroughly integrated.
A lot of other neighborhoods are de facto, and fairly viciously,
segregated, but that's true, and inexcusable, almost everywhere in this
country. In San Diego, where I now live, even the street traffic, such as
it is, is segregated, except for a handful of small downtown neighborhoods,
in one of which I live. Many of New York's (and San Francisco's) suburbs
are equally so, especially where race and class work together, and so are a
lot of NYC neighborhoods--not too many white faces in BedSty or Harlem, not
too many non-Italians in Bensonhurst. And foot traffic doesn't necessarily
equal domicile, even in the more enlightened neighborhoods.
How does this translate to the lit world? I've been out of New York for
about ten years, so maybe things have changed, but I can think of only a
handful of non-anglo regular participants in the scenes that I knew best
over the 30 years that I was involved--St. Mark's, the Upper West Side, the
Ear--and no anglo participants in, for instance, the West Indian poetry
scene that flourishes in Brooklyn. I'd love to be wrong about this.

Here's a Newton story. In the early 70's I dated a woman who belonged to a
Boston commune that suddenly found itself homeless. They lucked into a
month-to-month rental in the Newton of grand estates--the owner was trying
to figure out what to do with the property and figured he might as well pay
the tax burden with a rental. As a result eight scruffy types, including
one poet and two people of color, spent three years in a 40 room mansion. I
don't know what the neighbors thought, or if they even knew--the place sat
in the middle of 12 acres of field, forest and pond. But I guess they had
integrated Newton. And they gave great parties.

Pumpsie Green found the distances difficult to navigate, the hardscrabble
pitiless. efforting the needful, he came up lacking. his brother Cornell
gained distinction with the Dallas Cowboys, Pumpsie just got drunk with his
extra tall teammate and boded something about flying to Israel: never got
there. heroes are sometimes incomplete, as are most political moves.
gestures are far more agreeable. the days grow shadowy at certain times, a
matter of physical space, the dialectic of disadvantage. this is home for
the clouded, this relentless physical insistence. that there be a place;
that that place be filled; that intention grows ever more difficult in the
demands of more space and less. Pumpsie never became a man, for he always
was. always, no matter how carved from the ulteriour and sent down the
river. the writers on the beat aren't now and never were anyway close to the
core, nor have they access to the margins. they just know something
happened, know by an inferiour logic. they never reach the end of the line
because, why, that line bends indistinctively into a polite class war, the
kind we save for our neighbours. the line bends to return, then bends again.
how much engagement can one stand? Pumpsie was not our neighbour, perhaps,
but was equally lost. community doesn't survive for nothing. deliverance is
a sensible point of view, in the rare guarded age we've made. the song
follows the social dictates as ever, forever, filling the stream with a
little trail of blood, figurative blood, the only kind any of us believe in.
the miners look up, suddenly discover Pumpsie, in the sharp cone of their
sight. your edge is now mainframe, sir, they say, and gracefully embrace the
formerly failing ballplayer.

Thank ~you!~ . . .  Sir.

I wanted to add, but decorum precludes:

The way he goes on and on about how the one "saving grace" of the
book is all this supposed erotica he quotes ("'As I pinch my nipples,'"
"Brown puts an erotic twist on this", "Beat erotics", ~"polymorphous~
relation to gender" [my emphasis], "That and sex", "orgy . . . is just getting
warmed up"), Ziolkowski seems to be giving a single-mindedly ~horny~
reading of an apparently very ~literary~ book . . . as if it were all some
sort of ~panty raid~ which Brown ("goofy in a troubadour-hippie-Fugs
way", like straight from ~Dogpatch~) had lured him into. (Note the telltale
~"Fugs."~) I'd say, on that vein, --- and this is when he was in a ~good~
mood and having his jollies, --- that Z. got stuck in a (heterosexualized)
he-reader/she-author wish fulfillment as to what the book might be, and
read it entirely through the fact that the cover has the name of a female
author on it.  He seems to have misread the title as ~Per-verse,~ rather
than ~Polyverse~ (as I think his entendre about "polymorphous" brings to
the surface).

1. please see sedgwick's intro to Novel Gazing, puclished Duke Press 1997
for a primer on "queer theory" which departs ferociously from, says a
thousand goodbyes to, freud and his cronies whose arrested sexual (theory)
development  foisted repression on any and everything not deemed 'natural'
or 'biological' - this (queer theory) comes from a regard for identity as
a lot of hooey, and the notion that pieces of art are extensions of
social, sexual, personal identity is based  completely in typecasting
"cut-ups" as something not original, lyrical, personal, constitutive of
the breeder's identity (nowadays put into sterile, scientized terms like
genes, DNA, genetic blueprint, etc) - fine, cut-ups are bastards - the
point is that queer theory would never regard art as the children of
artists in the first place, let alone concede that gay men have mules -
(art unable itself of reproducing)

2. queer theory has very little truck with terms like 'gay," "lesbian"
"hetero" - that's the point of queer theory - throwing out the babies, the
bathwater , that all this identity festers in - and leaving the
paranoia to the new historicists - queer theory is mired in
production , the point is that is does so regardless of its subscription
to its own identity

3. not everyone has to have babies - some women don't have babies - some
women who fuck with men don't have babies - some women who fuck with
women don't have babies - some women who  fuck men have babies and then
give them away - some men who fuck men have babies - some men who fuck
women have babies - some men who fuck women have
babies and then kill them - some men want babies who like particularly to
fuck men and women- some women who fuck women have babies

burroughs had a kid - cage was married to xenia - rauschenberg loves dogs
-andy loved edie - you see how one could go on and on

earl jackson did a terrific talk on cut-up technique and gay sexuality at
the Queer Beats conference in November of 1996.  as i recall, he seemed to
make the association through the experience of *dis*sociation gay guys of
the 50s must have felt between experience and the possible expressions or
means of representing it.

others are either writing about him or teaching his work.

Salmon in the Breakers

October 1989, how pure and big a wound, the branches in their homelessness,
the sea is still the sea, but we are dust or will be, the president is dead,
the unequivocal seagulls, Scardenelli, you're not mad, the turning of the
earth against the sun,
once upon a time, a Cherokee, a whiskey sour, bluebird dead by now

as its always been a bluebird, this is love, in a photo, waning like an
affect,
in a dream, the cigarettes, it takes three to make a story, at Pleasure
Point  the surfers,
& I will never die, out of season, 4 X 4, over & over again, but no-one
wants a raga,
90210, the wave paced at its interval, take my hand, for I exist, finally
between two poems

rather than two people, three of us in a tree, multiplied by seven, a
perfect fifth,
its resonance, you are a swallow, the flower is not the flower, this is my
name,
& I am twice, & I will never die again, my life as always before belated
love, this is grammar,
the analogue is each, the outcropped cliff above the beach, three salmon in
the breakers.

An excerpt:


Hand-wheeled public vehicles artifical hand
fashion anything invoked, the least of them
defy the least of them unwittingly managed,
the sole centrifuge of outranged socialism,
vituperance run government. Could scarecrow
stabilizer, running stabilizer, and gravity
stabilizer get a human individual, or train
in the use of it. Pleased indeed. Who began
to support a vast radially spinning gravity
scheme. Who indeed. Who appeared in lieu of
the collective to spread out. Support world
of wheeled integration, defy mixed grenades
and anything national. He run. He fast. And
direct them in the use of multiparty public
vehicles. On the pot, there spinning quasi-
Goebbels, on the pot, there running gravity
the human balancer. Unlike, unlike, unlike.
Super-single, and super world gyroscope are
there demonstrated indeed there accustomed.

Supplement to MLK Job List -- August 14, 1999
The following job is extremely time sensitive:
Academy of Court Reporting, Cleveland, Ohio.
http://www.netset.com/~academy/

Come celebrate the poetics of working class politics at the millenium in the

town that's famous as the birthplace of Albert Ayler and the early factory
poems of Hart Crane--and, of course, the Program in Adult Education at the
Academy of Court Reporting, which is pleased to announce and invite
applications for an English Teacher to teach grammar, composition,
vocabulary, tech-dental terminology, legal terminology, law office
management, transcript English, business writing, critical thinking,
geography and general job counseling in a privately owned paralegal and
court
reporting program beginning at the end of September, 1999. ACR, a growing
multi-campus business college located in the same downtown Cleveland
Rockefeller Building where John D. built his Oil Empire and where Abraham
Lincoln once spent the night, sits a few blocks from the same streets
(reminiscent of the Old South) that will host a police-escorted white
supremacy rally on August 21, 1-3 p.m.  August 13 Plain Dealer:
"Journalists
who enter the areas designated for protestors and sympathizers will not be
allowed to bring any writing utensils, notepads, tape recorders of cameras,
[Mayor] White said."  A poet of arguable reputation with insignificant small

press book publication and non-documented teaching assistantships is being
sought for this part-time position. Typically the teaching load for the
English Teacher is five to seven classes per quarter.  The academic year
consists of four quarters, with one week off in between (without pay).
Salary is commensurate with the non-union service sector industry. The
English Teacher receives $11.25 per hour for each hour spent in the class
room.  On the basis of an average courseload of six classes at four hours
instruction per week, the English Teacher may expect to receive an typical
weekly salary of $250-$300 (without benefits).   The English Teacher may
expect to be responsible for 60 to 100 students per quarter.  ACR-Cleveland
currently enrolls about 300 undergraduates in paralegal and court reporting
studies. There is an open admissions policy, and the English program has no
support from anyone, anywhere.  The faculty in the English Program was for a

short while comprised of two poets (Richard Wagle and Kevin Magee).  "Mr.
Wagle" left in at the end of March. His replacement, a retired high school
teacher, recently told a student to her face and in front of her classmates
that "ask" pronounced "axe" is ignorant. Many students were justifiably
hurt,
and upset.  "Mr. Magee" is leaving in mid-September. ACR-Cleveland is home
to
a campus literary magazine which keeps changing its name, sample sound-bites

from which include Lori El-Amin's "his sexy hard hazel eyes and his loving
thug passion" (written to a boyfriend killed in a bar brawl in response to
the routine composition topic, 'What's the worst thing that happened to you
this week') and the self-declared 'Wild Irish Rose,' Missy Dowling's "Even
this some day will pass/But not before you kick some ass" (written to a
boyfriend in prison).  About 95% of ACR students, most of whom come from
east
of East 1999, are single mothers balancing children, minimum wage part-time
jobs, and a strict attendance policy.  Review of applications continues
until
the first person responds. Send cover letter and resume (no letters of
recommendation are required) to: Education Director, Academy of Court
Reporting/Cleveland Campus, Cleveland, Ohio.  Invisible faculty wives and
Minority candidates strongly encouraged to apply.

Anna Julia Cooper
i.e., What a Falling Off There Was:
Who remembers that Oberlin College
was one of the half dozen colleges
for Black Women mentioned by Ms. Cooper
in her radical reconstruction "Zhenotdel" writings
before the White Terror unleashed Jim Crow
and moved masses of laborers into the northern mills?

Barbara Evans Clements:
"Viewed from another angle, it was also
one of the most utopian, most egalitarian,
most hopeful ventures of the 1920s.  The Zhenotdel
was hundreds of young women, some still teenagers,
walking barefoot from village to village in the summers,
carrying copies of "Krestianka" to read aloud to peasants
in the evenings.  It was factory workers proudly opening
the day care centers they had scrounged and saved for.
It was communes and cooperatives, lunchrooms and laundries,
all organized and run by women.  That is, the Zhenotdel . . .
was also, like so much else in the 1920s, a project animated
by a magical sense of the limitless possibilities of a revolutionary new
world."

The authority I would trust on this question is Bryce Conrad, who claims
that Jacataqua is Williams's invention.  See Conrad, "Engendering History:
The Sexual Structure of William Carlos Williams' IN THE AMERICAN GRAIN,"
TWENTIETH-CENTURY LITERATURE 35.3 (Fall 1989): 254-78.  See p. 266 for the
claim of invention and note 8 on pp. 275-76 for a discussion of possible
sources.  There may be more info in Conrad's book on IAG, which I don't
have at my fingertips:  Refiguring America : a study of William Carlos
Williams' In the American grain (U of Illinois P, 1990).

Years ago I taught a textbook, Art After Modernism, and man, I remember
being so excited by it so that I couldn't see straight! I wanted to be in
it as well! Now, I found the book, worn and second-hand at a bookstore,
looking old, but the texts are as fresh and useful as ever. Immediately I
started reflecting on the aging I'm going through on the way to death, how
I have memories which are _these_ memories and no others, memories of
_this_ unfolding world and no other. I would love my mind to play tricks
on me. But there is something to be said always about the inertness of the
real, in relation to possible worlds theory - that almost everything
appears after the fact to be a natural kind, implicit in the makeup of
memory and thinking, and the rest, all those untaken paths, paths known
and unknown, are elsewise to such an extent that they do not affect the
body, the way the _one_ path does, the _one path_ we are setting down our
whole life. It is only later and latest that the path appears _as such,_
and there is a great sadness with its appearance; it's delicate, ephemer-
al, in the midst of others which were lost. Yet it contains those natural
kinds which are the natural kinds of memory, those tagged, interrelated,
and taken for granted. Because of this, because of the inertness, it's
clear that the natural kinds of, say, Kripke or those possible worlds, are
processes of community formation, that they intend communalities and com-
monalities of history. But I am aging and what do I know.

The same of course is true of philosophy; _these_ are the authors I have
read, and no other, I might have taken those other courses, might have
become an entirely different person, what if Wittgenstein's Tractatus
wasn't available in Israel, on the shelf before me, in 1962? I read it
naively; I had no idea what I was doing, but the resonance was there, and
as a child I did pick up such a book and hold it close to me. Were I such
a child. Were I such, but not; I become untouchable, repelled by my own
history, all too fragile, gasping for air, caressing and cultivating the
Thing which remains just adjacent to unequivocal death.

The path is mine alone; the walls, floor, and ceiling are mine. There are
no doors; later, one knows as well that the windows are absent.


Th e


The path i s mine a lone;  the wa lls, floor, and ce iling are mi ne.
There are no doors;  later, one kn ows as wel l that t he window s are ab
sent.

jeffrey jullich writes:

"Wednesday's Village Voice runs a lukewarm or even unfavorable review of
Lee Ann Brown's ~Polyverse,~ filled with gratuitous innuendo about
Language Poetry...."

"lukewarm" made be accurate; "unfavorable" and "harsh polemic" are, i
think, stretching it. frankly i prefer ziolkowski's review to the sort of
collective gush that has constituted the responses to this book that i've
seen up to now. (and aside from haas -- that he would give the book notice
in the /post/ in the first place is significant.) what ziolkowski refers
to as the book's "terminally reverent tendency" to engage prior poetic
models applies equally well, i think, to a tendency on the part of any
poetic readership to take a book so highly anticipated and long awaited
unquestioningly into its embrace.

certainly the review is cheeky, provocative, irreverant even.  but this is
why i appreciate it.  ziolkowski's tone, that of a more mature poet
reading a less mature one, is odd, given that, if my information is
correct, there is only three years' age difference between him and brown.
and i don't agree with his notion that for a patchwork of styles to be
successful it should be "synthesized into something exciting and strange."

but i don't necessarily see "gratuitous innuendos" or even open aspersions
being cast here, at brown, bernstein, or language poetry.  i mean, "more
heart than head, goofy in a troubadour-hippie-fugs way" may strike as more
backhanded than compliment, but i would think "goofy" done right is as
admirable and necessary as "the serious."

would charles take offense at the charge of being an imprimatur-wielder?
of course it's his position in the field that entitles him to pick the
winner of the (yes, prestigous no scare quotes) NAP series in a given
year, but i don't think he'd want to don the cloak of infallibility
thereupon.

and what poetics, reduced to a set of devices, does not risk becoming a
"lifeless automatic pilot"?  for ziolkowski, the erotic element in brown's
work helps her avoid this, tho not enough to overcome what he sees as the
work's limitations.  not a bad assessment for a first book...

(which i haven't read tho am more tempted to now)

When in despair with fortune, Azure all alone,
I caught this morning, morning's minion, close to bone,
Where life is short, the art difficult and long,
Though the harbor, barred, is moaning a dark song:
These are the days which try men's souls, and women's,
Going never gentle into that good night, have summoned
The swollen bell - spilled all, told, but none for thee,
Whose hollowed body moans, not banging, whimpering.
How do I love you, I forgot those young and youthful ways
Good neighbors fenced - and all through such bleak days
I had a lean and hungry look - such men are dangerous
For babes in London, worlds in wildflowers; now Celia
Shits, she's lovely as a tree, I swallow, comfort thee,
What comfort is in me? The times are changing, to be
The apologia: Marion among the lilies, weeping,
Spread herself upon the hill, the sky came seeping.

        For those who want an antidote to the recent Thad Ziolkowski
botched review of Lee Ann Brown's POLYVERSE, I hope you'll read my review
of the same book that's forthcoming in the October issue of Poetry Project
Newsletter. I wish it was available now, but it will be shortly.

        Along with Jeffrey Jullich, I agree that Thad's sense that Lee Ann
"fails to synthesize" the various traditions that she's working with
misses the mark rather badly, that in fact the idea of "synthesis" is in
many ways precisely what the book is NOT about. Lee Ann's goal seems to me
neither to repeat certain poetic traditions, nor to synthesize their
differences, but to destabilize these various traditions, both from within
their conditions by rewriting their implications, and by putting them
beside each other in a way that calls the notion of maintaining singular
poetic traditions into question. It's not about synthesizing, but about
"being next to," not about a new singularity but allowing
disruptive multiple approaches to come into dialogue with each other in a
way that's purposely frustrating and liberating.

I've always found Lee Ann's poetry charming, and I look forward to reading
her book, but I think this handwringing over a wrongheaded review is a
little strange, and more a testimony to how much a lot of us like Lee Ann
than anything else. Surely I'm not the only list member who's been reviewed
by clueless reviewers--sometimes they even praise facets of the work that
are their own invention, which, frankly, doesn't feel a lot better than
negative comment. Isn't this the risk we take when we go public? Isn't this
especially true if we write in innovative ways?

It is a shame that the review appeared in such a public venue. Complaining
about it here is preaching to the choir: a letter to the editor might be
more useful.

Boston, indeed, was high tension racist when i lived there, a solitary
black risked linching attempting to get a drink in a southey bar and none
but the foolhardiest irishman found themselves on the streets of dorchester
after dark.
But I found L.A. pretty racist especially the police tho the mayor, the
former chief of police was black, the cops black and white, never missed an
opportunity to put a black male up against the car if he was walking with a
white woman, even when they walked with their child, it was sick making.
The only thing out of the ordinary about Rodney King was they didn't arrest
him for assaulting sixteen officers. Thousands of Bufords out there in the
valley looking for a scapegoat for their misery they'd rather share their
suffering than your possibility. American shoots bursting from and
reproducing in the bedrock of hatred, the cornerstone, the engine of the
American colonial success.
 racism isn't unknown in Canada, but it seems more opportunistic less
psychotic if they might eat some of the fish youwant to sell you'll hate
them for keeping you from being as rich as you deserve.

YET ANOTHER SAD STORY TO URGE YOU TO PLEASE SUBSCRIBE: Chain remains
pathetically underfunded. The only institutional support we get is in
mailing costs (last year when one of us went to the dean requesting some
minor monetary support for Chain, she was told that the department
doesn’t need to have any journals in this era of budget cuts).

To break even on printing costs, all we need is around 350 subscribers.
While we easily get 350 submissions for an issue, we have trouble
keeping a subscription base of half that going. We know our situation is
not unique. We urge those of you that value, submit to, and/or publish
in independent journals to support them by subscribing.

If you would like to make a donation, `A `A Arts is a not for profit

the law. Remember us at the end of the year when you want to make a
charitable donation to keep your taxes down.

This list may have gotten too large for new folks to introduce themselves
at any length, but even so I'd like to make everyone aware that I'm a good
source for questions regarding SPD and SPD titles, both of which come up
with some frequency on this list.

Currently I'm working as their/our Sales Manager (full identity association
has yet to take complete hold on me), and I've developed the habit of
wandering through the stacks during breaks.  If it seems relevant, I plan
to pass on some of my findings.

i.e. speaking of Jonas, I noticed that we still have seven copies of Steven
Jonas's THREE POEMS (1989, Rose) at their original price of five dollars.
Many used books stores are already selling THREE POEMS as rare.  I've only
gotten through the first poem, but it's an excellent piece of work.  So,
really, there are only six copies remaining.

Although I am rarely tempted to weigh in here, because I'm never
entirely sure where "in" is, I will attempt to do such weighing, if
only to agree with this reaction, and to suggest that reviews are only
as influential as their readers make them. They are, by definition,
works of opinion--and in so being, are always slightly "wrongheaded."
That's one of a reviewer's highest privileges, I would say, although I
realize it's not much of a privilege. (Compared to, say, the ability to
fly, or eternal youth, or even a bag of magic rhizomes.) (None of which
most reviewers should ever hope for.) I would also suggest that most of
the people who would be Lee Ann Brown's best readers are not the sort
who would read the Village Voice, or any other newspaper, without a
certain amount of skepticism.  One would hope they would read the book
for themselves.

Enough of my naive jawing.

        to visit his mom and stepdad.

Former New York Yankee catcher Thurman Munson died

        practicing takeoffs and landings in his single-engine Cessna.

I machine wish Anselm safe flight,

The following article is from this morning's NPR <www.npr.org>,
but I've been unable to find much information in U.S. papers. A
summary of the strike, which began on 20 April in response to
the privatization of the university - and accompanying increase
in tuition from two cents to $150 per year, in a country where
minimum wage is approx. $2.50 US/day - is available at
<http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3843/UNAM.htm>.
Other citations would be much appreciated.

Mexican School Strike

Classes at Mexico's largest university were
supposed to start this week, but hundreds of
thousands of striking students boycotted the
return to class. The National Autonomous
University of Mexico remains closed for a
fourth month, and university officials say the
semester has been indefinitely suspended. It
appears that the strike, which was sparked by
tuition increases, has broadened into a struggle
over the future of Mexico and a protest of
Mexico's embrace of the global free market
economy.

I rock back on my butt bones

        I will be taking the DC Metro.

On this day many years ago talk-poet Frank O'Hara
        was probably taking the Noo Yawk
        subway, and writing about it.

I silent wish myself sharp elbows
        and rapid flight to the dreary burbs

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

          What poets are saying about Swift's  Budavox :


Nicole Blackman (poet/performer, author of Blood Sugar):"Luminous,
unexpected, lovely and unsettling, the images resonate long after the
poems have ended."

Regie Cabico (NY performance poet, co-editor Poetry Nation):"Swift's
eerie verse transforms suspicion to the lyrical. Kevin Spacey shakes
hands with Catullus,
savage and gentlemanly. He concocts Eros and murder in the sharp prisms
of his imagination. The results: a deliciously carnivorous and ironic
language."

Derek Mahon (Irish poet, author of The Yellow Book): "Swift is a voice
for our times."

George Szirtes (British poet, author of Selected Poems, Oxford
University Press, 1996)   : "Swift's poems move between the familiar and
exotic, from the meditative through the speculative. His poetic language
too is on the move, from the crisp tentativeness of Elizabeth Bishop to
the outer suburbs of Wallace Stevens and even, here and there, Ginsberg.
The intimate is always threatened: reality is  challenged by its myths.
These poems show a young man exploring the world before him with
intelligence, grace, even a certain bravado. They make a very auspicious
first collection."

Adeena Karasick (poet/performer, author of Genrecide, Talon Books,
1996):
"An intensely lyrical, speculative, contemplative interrogation of all
that is twisted, wounded, awe-filled and desperate... writing that is
dark, swollen and balanced with great beauty."

Robert Priest (poet/performer, author of Resurrection in the Cartoon,
ECW Press, 1997):
"Complex, mysterious triggering poems often full of dark currents and
understated hostilities that ruffle the feathers and unsettle - as good
poetry should."

New Media Boosts an Old Mural
by Kendra Mayfield
3:00 a.m.  17.Aug.99.PDT
SAN FRANCISCO -- When Mexico's master artist Diego Rivera created the mural
Pan American Unity for the 1940 World's Fair, he fused images of art and
technology to unite the peoples of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
World War II interrupted plans for a library to display the mural. It
remained hidden until Rivera's death in 1957, when it was transported to
the San Francisco City College theater, where it remains today -- widely
unknown to the public.

See also: 'Web Seance' Summons Art

A new multimedia project hopes to revive Rivera's ideas in the digital and
virtual realm. An interactive kiosk and Web site, launches 18 August at
City College. They will attempt to restore the mural to public prominence,
even as it returns to Rivera's theme of blending art and technology.
"The mural represents a powerful historical statement of what has gone on
in this century," said Julia Bergman, City College archivist. The
multimedia project will expose the public to one of Rivera's most
significant and unrecognized masterpieces, she said, "a work of art that is
so universal for so many people."
Blending images of Mexican art and North American technology and
innovation, Rivera's mural examines the convergence of ancient techniques
and contemporary art. Ancient Mayan figures are juxtaposed with inventors
from the Industrial Revolution like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.
Revolutionary South American heroes join North American political leaders
to fight Nazism and preserve peace by extending the arts. In the center of
the mural, a Canadian sculpting with an ax symbolizes the metamorphosis
between old art forms and new techniques.
"My mural ... is about the marriage of the artistic expression of the North
and of the South on this continent," said Rivera in a 1940 interview. The
artist envisioned "... this blending of the art of the Indian, the Mexican,
the Eskimo, with the kind of urge which makes the machine."
The current project revives Rivera's ideas of combining old ways of
thinking in a modern context, using new, interactive methods to present the
fresco to the public.
The kiosk exhibit reflects the mural, with a wood and steel nautilus shell
combining modern and ancient materials. Using a touch-screen, users can
view the imagery of the 22-by-70 foot mural, its fresco technique, and its
checkered history. Users can virtually enter the Aztec god figure of
Quetzalcoatl and end up in a control room, where they can navigate within
the mural.
Viewers can zoom in on images to examine intricate brushstrokes and words
hidden within the upper panels of the fresco. Sketches and drawings of
Aztec figures morph from stone statues to polished images.
The kiosk will feature film clips, which Rivera believed represented the
perfect blending of art and technology. Viewers can tour the mural,
listening to Rivera's voice while watching clips of some of the people who
shaped the artist's life.
"The motion picture is the ultimate development of mural painting," said
Rivera in a 1940 interview, "and is the most original contribution to art
made by North American culture."
The portable kiosk will travel to schools and museums in the United States
and Mexico as an experiment in distance-learning.
With universal themes of diversity and multiculturalism that still resonate
today, the mural offers an educational tool for teachers wanting to expose
students to the art of mural-making and the history surrounding the mural.
The exhibit may offer up to 40 courses, with CDs for teachers to distribute
in computer labs. Educators may use Rivera's ideas to teach courses
promoting cultural identity.
Creative director Richard Rodrigues wants to create a distance-learning
project in which a student in Mexico can interact with a student in
California, or view restoration of the mural in real time through an onsite
view cam. He hopes that learning about the mural's history will make kids
think twice about defacing public buildings with graffiti.
The mural kiosk is unique, because similar projects tend to cover many
works of art. This one offers viewers a way to "look at a piece of art like
no one has before," said Rodrigues.
As the exhibit travels from place to place, students may add their own
graphic panels to the mural by scanning images that will be added to the
exhibit. Individual artists can generate ideas and images from the mural,
becoming mural-makers themselves.

SHOWING WHERE SLAVERY'S SHADOWS ALSO FALL (Part One).

3/27[95]

Sunrise. Upper West Side. Manhattan.

Aife's story of the servant's handwriting on the other side of the poet's
manuscript --Maher/Dickinson--allegorized.

That by the time Steve Abbott writes the Conversations and dedicates them to
Spicer--how fraught is this dedication?

The way in which Spicer's "infinitely small vocabulary" and grammar/syntax
control mechanisms--that force of repression is so acute in his text--that
the social/historical Real and his sexuality both enter in eruption (not the
sexuality--the sexuality is key--its what opens up the Dictation--and the
Poetics of Dictation and call to the Imaginary is key to read what was
happening in the post-war years, what Blaser/Spicer/Duncan were on to.  (Read
the Olson/Creeley correspondence against this).

3/28[95]

In flight, across the continent.  Layers/Stages/Phases of RELEASE.
Repression.  On a cultural field.  Closure.  What erupts.  What comes
through--into the open [in distorted form].

1.  "O women women look how my words flow out"--The eruption of subjectivity,
oceanic imaginary.  The ghost of Dickinson in the ACTS Spicer issue, where is
she?  Killian's "Attention: Harlot" or in the French, Guglielmi's French?  Un
trou dans l'imagination.  Invagination.  Anal inscription.

2.  Queering.  Perversions of control.  Determined functions.  Graphic
exposure.  What is unsexed ("unfucking").  The Imaginary.  The Utopian.  The
Land of Oz.  "Somewhere over the Rainbow."

3.  Postcolonial.  Translation.  The cultural/historical.  The call to the
cultural/historical conditions of social intercourse.  The metaphor of
opening up to infection from foreign agents/tongues.  Dream of the
possibility of putting an end to Western/Eastern-Northern/Southern borders.
Imminent degeneration of the English language--Dante's Latin--"Immigration
Song."  "The Lemon Song."

I remember Led Zeppelin I remember somewhere back there in the University
reading a book by a Russian cultural critic whose last name started with a K
and the first names that pop up are Kropotkin and Kruschev--bizarre
substitutions--and then Kolokethias--though that one's Greek, and the name of
the woman I spoke with on the phone calling from Iowa to San Francisco for
information about the Jack Spicer conference--all I remember from that
conversation now was that she said "O, wow,"--something I associated with
California, the idea of California--Sherman Paul having claimed in a class
that Gary Snyder was the first one to put "Wow" in a poem--but it wasn't in
Sherman Paul's class that I was reading a book with a Moscow imprint--it was
in the seminar of a professor who was denied tenure--(once on a panel about
Art & Politics in the Weimar period he prefaced--recontextualized--his
remarks by drawing attention to the U.S. bombing raid over Libya the day or
two before--the raid that killed Khadafy's child--and this child showed up
again when I was in Nicaragua--there was a free daycare center for factory
workers named after her--I must have been struck enough by that--since I took
a photograph of a child's painting that was on the wall of a hospital and
rehab center for amputees--the drawing of a child standing on one leg
(Spicer's seagull--my displacement of Spicer's seagull--and, yes, Ron, it's
hard to think of anything less pure than a seagull's belly--except for a
child's mind--the perversity of children--polymorphous perverse--and
receivers of all casualties (I almost wrote casualties)--only a child in
their intense inhabitation of the Imaginary could return the reality of war
in a perfect image--a child looking like all the world like a crippled
seagull--because it is unnatural to have your arms or legs blown off--whether
you are 7 or 37 or 77--man woman or child--relative terms, all of them--I was
thinking about Moscow--another relative term.  This Russian cultural critic
was drawing attention to the crippled talent of Jimmy Page--the division of
labor in the making of art--that the Rock Star phenomenon has tragic
dimensions--you become an icon--removed from both the club scene and the
black music you stole--you get removed from your class--the absolute,
fundamental condition for every artist in America from the working class no
matter what art you make--high or low--and Jack Spicer wrote a high art that
never forgot the low--and now that he's released his first CD and a Mystery
Novel it's going to be interesting to see whether the terms of this new stage
in his popularity will depend on bracketing out the "class" thing.  There was
this thing at the 1986 conference--something that carried into Bruce Boone's
comment, his statement in the ACTS issue, "the little of Jack Spicer that
remains"--the dislocation or dislodging that conference represented from the
MANROOT context--that the body of work signed Jack Spicer was being opened up
to a larger reading/audience and what happens when that happens--and what was
happening then?--not in the conference, per se, but outside?  [Memory of
Boone's comment about the disappearance of a radical gay community (no, I
don't think there was any lesbian presence at that conference--the panelists
were all male as were the contributors to the Spicer ACTS), something about
co-optation--it was an offhand remark, but it had an economic content--].
What was in the MANROOT that gets mutated--softened--in the Spicer ACTS?
"Three Marxist Essays" from THE SAN FRANCISCO CAPITALIST BLOODSUCKER-N.  In
the Spicer ACTS, there is a comment by Michael Davidson that Marxism-Leninism
is a "safe" ideological position, and a typo in the text of his talk which
leaves out the "i" and turns 'communism' into 'communsm'; Kevin Killian's
displacement of Spicer's Martian's with the possibility of a poetics of
Anonymity, "Anonymous is method of writing coming at you from unknown
direction without a good reason"; a fascinating remark by Lew Ellingham about
just how wide Spicer's work was opening at the end of his life, including the
return of Trotsky--"Trotskyite bandits from the hills"--a wild return and
recovery from the imperious and dead wrong suppression of "Lili who worked in
the canneries" in the first pages of Robert Duncan's H.D. BOOK; Ron
Silliman's recycling of the same line, "Trotskyite bandits from the hills"
and displacement of Dictation with Translation (supplementing Spicer with
Benjamin), which moves him into a reading of a Spicer with a far more
theoretical grip on the problem of naming than someone like myself can read
who wants to read, instead, the eruptions of Sex and Class that happen there;
and then there is the marvel of Robin Blaser's anecdotal aside--that Emma
Goldman and Rosa Luxumberg were heroines in Jack's mind, and that he never
forgave the circumstances of his own birth, purchased at the cost of his
father leaving the radical labor politics of the I.W.W.  "Somehow never to
forgive your own birth," Blaser said, thinking aloud.  The trauma that the
Art of Poetry represents for anyone coming out of conditions of cultural
illiteracy.  That includes all of us, you might say.  No.  Some can buy it,
and some can't.  Them that can't, that don't have it--on an economic
level--dollars & cents--"for 15 cents I could ride a subway in New York"
(Spicer's notebook fragment late '64) experience this lack--internalize this
lack--and what you get from it is layers, walls of impediments when it comes
to writing--the poetic act--impediments that run as deep if not deeper than
speech impediments--we've been speaking their language for so long we no
longer have one of our own--if we ever did have one--at least those of us who
speak English--these impediments have everything to do with
Repression--sexuality is, again, a common denominator, and, again, the
"class" thing, is obscure, gets obscured--that the impediment so much a part
of the consciousness of social class has to do with perceptions of the right
to knowledge--that all property is theft--to quote Steve Abbott's
introductory remarks to THE LIZARD CLUB, that all knowledge is property--if
these are extreme positions, I would only want to add that the division of
society into classes puts us in an extreme condition.

[Note:  This is the first part of a talk on CLASS held at my home on a panel
which included Kathy Lou Schultz on Karen Brodine, and Aife Murray on
Dickinson/Maher in the spring of 1995.  I don't remember very many people
being there that night (not to take away from the handful who came).  The
subject of social class was of course a bit of a problem, but I also had the
impression--perhaps mistaken, or exaggerated--based on casual conversations
and at least one letter--that Steve Abbott was more or less an obscure, if
not difficult figure, hard to figure out.  An enigma, not unlike James
Clarence Mangan.  The remainder of this talk seeks to place him as a North
American Attila Jozsef, whose pronounced leftism and proto-communism meant a
lot to me, though I was appalled to learn during the course of my last visit
to SF of the willful, symptomatic forgetting of the (1981?) LEFT/WRITE
conference (at least nobody'd ever mentioned it to me) more or less erased
from history?  Why?  What happened?  Who read?  I think the event documents
are buried in a couple of boxes in somebody's basement.]

Come on, Kevin Magee, there is no conspiracy against forgetting Steve
Abbott and the leftwrite conference.  I would hardly call someone not
mentioning something to you willful forgetting.

When his daughter Alysia was here on father's day and gave a talk on
Steve at A Different Light Bookstore, it was well-publicized and well
attended.  She's put up a wonderful and popular website in Steve's
honor:

http://www.steveabbott.com

In July it was chosen as yahoo's new site of the day and Alysia
excitedly wrote us that it got 600 visitors the next day and a half:

http://dir.yahoo.com/new/19990714.html

I know a number of younger writers in SF very much interested in Steve's work.

And, as you well know, Kevin Killian is Steve's executor, and Steve's
papers are not in somebody's basement somewhere--they're in a dry
safe storage compartment for which we pay $$$$ for every month.
Kevin's trying to get Steve's papers archived, but there's been snags
there.  Being an executor is a thankless task.  Gibes like this are
uncalled for.

Of possible interest to List-ers, Paul Naylor's hot off the press
_Poetic Investigations: Singing the Holes in History_ (Northwestern
University Press).  Paul's book of criticism looks like a good one.

Contents
Introduction: Writing History Poetically
1. Susan Howe: Where Are We Now in Poetry?
2. Nathaniel Mackey: The "Mired Sublime"
3. Lyn Hejinian: Investigating "I"
4. Kamau Brathwaite: Tidalectic Rhythms
5. M. Nourbese Philip: "Dis Placing" Him

Naylor's writing draws on the work of Wittgenstein, Kristeva, Laclau,
Mouffe, Benjamin, and de Certeau.  As the editor of River City
Review, he published lots of important writing by Brathwaite,
Nourbese Philip, Mackey, and others.

My review copy arrived a couple of days ago--no price listed.
Perhaps Rod Smith or someone else knows what the price is....

Dear Lynn
I read your post on Bolsheviks and feminism. You mention Zhenotdel in
your post. My grandmother was the head of Zhenotdel after WWII in a
provincial town. She was a very active woman and power-lusty. Even in the
family my Granny ruled the waves. My grandfather couldn't cope with the
regime and receded into his private realm of hunting and fishing, of course
he worked, everybody had to work, he was a butcher, but he even had no idea
how to pay rent (the very sight of bills switched him off) so removed he
was from any kind of beaurocracy. The feminism then had to do predominantly
with power. The Bolsheviks' was a strange sort of feminism. The Party was
(not only claimed to be but somehow was) the carrier (or embodiment but
carrier here is a better word) of all ideology and spirituality, of all
things immaterial. I remember back in the 70s there were slogans everywhere
in St. Petersburg (Leningrad it was then) like this: The Party is the
Mind, Honour and Conscience of our Epoch. See what I mean? So the Party was
the Feminism of our Epoch too. And when it collapsed, when the frame
collapsed, everything that was hanging on this frame collapsed too.

Many have asked for more details about the Whitney American Century 2 Sound
Works. This is from Stephen Vitiello:

From: stephen vitiello <svitiello@eai.org>
Subject: Re: Whitney Details

Thanks for the note and all enthusiasm.

There are two things happening. Yoko Ono's and Terry Fox's works will be on
stairway landings. Michel Auder, Art by Telephone and Adrian Piper will be
heard in or around one of the phone booths on the second floor. Julia Scher
will be in the 2nd floor bathrooms.

The rest will be played one or two times in the Film and Video Gallery
during the week of January 11.  The speakers will be re-set to ear level
rather than overhead film scale. Lights will be dimmed and seats will be
set-up to make it as conducive to listening as possible. There will not be
any live performances that I know of. I proposed several but there was no
money available. Annea Lockwood's piece will be a mini installation -- with
recordings of the river heard on the main sound system and a  second CD
player with headphones, will play oral histories. A clock and map will be
mounted on the wall which are specific to the work. Thursday evening with
works by Kaprow and Amacher will be a multi channel presentation. We will
set up multiple speakers and CD players.  Bill Fontana's documentations
will be accompanied by printed descriptions and histories. I will try to
make printed material available as often as possible.

Some of the works, such as the Cage piece and tapes from Charlotte Moorman
have never been released. Acconci's Running Tape and Nauman's Record are
more known of than heard. Nic Collins is making a new document of a classic
work. Bob Bielecki is known for his assisting everybody (La Monte Young,
P.Glass, L. Anderson., B.Viola) for the last 30 years but his incredibly
beautiful recordings have almost never been spotlighted as "works."

Thanks for the note on Melodie's name!


Also, here is a list of the the pieces that I selected for the Whitney
that will go up in September-January:

Cough Piece by Yoko Ono, Happy Birthday Mr.

Hello.

Certainly there are other sources of information on news from Mexico, but
for those of you who read Spanish, here is the address of La Jornada
online, if you want a sense of what one of Mexico's largest daily papers
has to say about the UNAM strike and/or any other topic. FYI, there's a
fantastic literary/cultural supplement which comes out every Sunday, and is
featured on the website.

The LeftWrite Conference was indeed 1981! It was attended by 250 people, a
superb turnout given how deeply depressed the left was during the first year
of the Reagan regime (I recall Michael Rosenthal of Modern Times telling me
that sales of Mao, Marx and Lenin stopped virtually cold the previous
November, a dropoff from which they've never recovered).  The panel I
participated on (with William Mandel and Diane DiPrima) was the largest
group I'd ever spoken to at that time. In addition to my work in the prison
movement, the Tenderloin and DSA, I have always been convinced that my
appearance on that panel directly led to my being selected editor of
Socialist Review five years later.

Steve Abbott's work as editor and organizer both (they're very similar
functions, terribly hard work and a great way to make enemies) were always
good. Poetry Flash was an important part of the community when Steve
directed it, and generally quite readable. When I got ready to turn over the
Tenderloin Writers Workshop in '81, Steve was one of the people whom I
approached about taking it over. He was too busy, he said, but he would have
done a great job.

People do forget, it's just the nature of time, and it never hurts to remind
folks. I think we're all very lucky to have Kevin Killian functioning as his
executor.

In a very similar vein, I've always been quite amazed at how little
attention the passing of Paul Mariah received a few years back. He was
directly responsible for keeping Spicer's work visible for a good part of
the ten years between Jack's death and the publication of the Collected
Books. Between his magazine Manroot, the various reading series he ran and
his own poetry, he was an absolutely visible presence in the poetry of SF in
the 1960s -- possibly the most visible poet in the entire community. Paul
was also the first person I knew who specifically articulated a gay poetics
as such -- even before Judy Grahn and Pat Parker. Two folks whom I first met
as a direct result of Paul's work (specifically running a reading series at
the Albany public library) were David Melnick and David Bromige, two people
whom I still count as strong influences and friends some 31 years later.

weather's fine and golf's my
handicap. no vacancies needed, we're all
presidents in line for the
groove thing. hello sturdy
documents of fitting in, hello
joining the little things together, hello to
progress and its evil
twin. the last best grungy
hope hampers the previous ones. the bass player
angers at the loss of recognition, amps blown
with the last dying power, and now, now: Greenland looks like
smoke on most maps. principles mean
time to talk. principles mean
open the floodgates. principles mean
miners have their system. me and you, illogically twinned
by an overbearing smirk, rise to the
sensational new day. it'll be Friday this
time, but don't give up the ship. shortages
will always be available, mapping a structure wherein
concern can be
marginalized into utility for
the same old union. learn to
hate, people, learn
to hate people, learn to hate. the
new element will supersede the old.

F.Y.I. Patrick F. Durgin's post refers to an much-deserved hack of
Benjamin Phelps' revolting "god hates fags" web site; you may
remember seeing Phelps and his followers in the nat'l news when
they showed up outside Matthew Shepard's funeral.

Kris Haight, operator of the pro-queer <www.godlovesfags.com>,
was given control of the <www.godhatesfags.com> domain by an
anonymous source, and used the opportunity to detourn Phelps'
page by substituting his own, similarly designed site. The domain
has since been more or less returned to Phelps' control, though an
intermediary page remains.

It's nice to see hackers can still do the right thing.

From the God Loves Fags site:

   "What a strange ride it has been. We were gifted with ownership of
Phelps's domain late
   Wednesday, and here we sit, 72 hours later having given it back. While
many of you
   don't understand why the domain had to go back to Phelps, we felt it was
in the best
   interest of ourselves, our service provider, our provider's uplink as
well as the gay rights
   movement everywhere to give it back. Read our formal statement here."

3/27[95]. 9:00 a.m.

On the steps of the NYC public library.  But I don't want to take Steve=20
Abbott away or outside the grouping it appears among in the Spicer ACTS, a=20
grouping that at the time the issue arrived in the mail on a farm in Iowa=20
sometime in late 87 reverberated for its reader as a document recording in=20
print pieces of a conversation he had overheard, attending a grouping which=20
in the ACTS inflects a hybridization of practices in miscellaneous or=20
occasional forms--the letter (real or imaginary), archive documents, photos,=20
collage and other graphics, all of which exert a certain pressure on the=20
names that pronounce the phenonemon of the single author--almost as if the=20
Spicer ACTS was a reconstructed tavern presided over by Jack's ghost--the=20
noise is so loud.  It's the noise at the corner of Fifth Ave. and 40th St.=20
waiting for the library to open, the anticipation of a quiet table in a quie=
t=20
room already implicated in a horizon of diminished expectations--a recorded=20
message informed me this morning the library was open from 9 to 9 only to=20
arrive to find the hours reduced to 10 to 6.  I woke up at 5:00 in a room on=20
the 10th floor overlooking Western Ave. at the corner of 102nd St. thinking=20
about the Dickinson/Maher association, Aife's mentioning the page of writing=20
with the servant's hand on the one side and the poet's on the other,=20
wondering whether it isn't Maher 'speaking' in the Master letters, thinking=20
of that as a way to read the "Conversations,"--as all but written in a=20
servant's hand on a page that belongs to the Poet--that the one might attach=20
to the other in such a fragile bond--and how the name Jack Spicer might one=20
day accrue around it the kind of authority or designation--when it is finall=
y=20
a brandname for a package---identifiable at a distance--when the act of=20
reading the work--when the work is no longer a threat in its=20
anti-institutional--when its pronounced hositility to all institutional form=
s=20
is finally brought in and included as part of the Academy's incorporative=20
machinery--and the moment when the name Jack Spicer begins to be separated=20
from its locality--its union local--one of the ironies of any posthumous=20
existence, especially since only in Dickinson is there as severe a Puritan=20
or--in Spicer's case--Calvinist--pride in the refusal of the Book as a form=20
of property.  Michael Davidson called this Spicer's "politics," . . . "one=20
based on anarchist principles of private refusal and mutual aid."  How could=20
any other form of radicalism appear in North American poetry in the years=20
immediately following the Second War.  That they appeared at all is in itsel=
f=20
remarkable, considering Duncan's disavowal, or refusal, couched in the voice=20
of judgment, of Lili's Trotskyist politics at the beginning of the HD Book. =20
Something of their necessity for Spicer comes through in Blaser's account,=20
i.e. "He never forgave his mother for forcing his father to settle down, on=20
account, of course, of his own birth . . . Somehow never to forgive one's=20
birth."  How can I talk about what's not there?  More than an absence, thoug=
h=20
there are huge gaps between the sentences clamped together as they are into=20
the (forced) semblance of a sequence.  Steve's "Now this poem / in which one=20
thing follows another" feels more like what the poet who wrote it thought he=20
was doing--the guilt coming into the writing about the inadequacy of that=20
writing--that it isn't smart enough--that it doesn't have what real good=20
poems have--whatever that is.  Somewhere in Spicer a page begins with "Real=20
bad poems."  One of these comments that float in from who knows where and=20
what is it doing there coming through, that it does comet through,=20
representing one of those openings for every poet who comes to writing with=20
severe impediments--whatever those impediments are--there are so many--like=20
the impediments for a migrant worker learning a new language and job skill. =20
Jack:  "Nobody's stranger than the stranger coming to dinner.  He can imitat=
e=20
anything or anybody."  Steve:  "Don't speak to me.  I don't want to hear=20
again how we got to be here."  Tom Beckett's poem follows Steve's in the=20
Spicer ACTS:  "Where we are is in a sentence."  Jack:  "Where we are this is=20
idiocy.  Where we are a block of solid glass blocks us from all we have=20
dreamed of.  But this place is not where we are to meet them."

How can I talk about what's not there?  What's there is carefully troped out=20
of Spicer, and that's not what I wanted to be there.  There's the question o=
f=20
how the Conversations were made, the great care taken in its putting=20
together.  "A machine to trap ghosts with."  But that's not it either.  The=20
timing--lack of speed, velocity, what feels instead like an excruciating=20
slowness as though one were learning to write with great pain and difficulty=
.=20
 Abbott presses into Spicer's work with such will, force, insistence--almost=20
methodical--that the Other winds up coming out through the back side of the=20
page.  Steve:  "And did anyone arrive at the other side?"  What is the other=20
side of the books authored by Jack Spicer?  Steve's "Don't speak to me" migh=
t=20
be heard as the protest of someone at the threshold of the confidence that i=
t=20
takes to write poetry.  Ron's quote from the Vancouver lecture, "The more yo=
u=20
know, the more language you know . . . the more building blocks the Martians=20
have to play with."  What if the building blocks are few?  What if the Alien=
s=20
don't arrive?  The Outside in Steve's poem is Jack's books read through a=20
radically other space--domestic economy--though this still doesn't get at=20
what's not there.  Translation.  Is class a language?  Jack:  "You are stuck=20
with language, and you are stuck with words, and you are stuck with the=20
things that you know."  When you come from the working class, what do you=20
know?  Silliman:  "Spicer's insistence on the instrumental function of=20
language."  Rope/Words.  Jack:  "They are what we hold on with, nothing else=
.=20
 They are as valuable in themselves as rope with nothing to be tied to." =20
Steve:  "At the end of our rope / we could have been anything."  There's thi=
s=20
beginning at an opening--free play--expanding choices--"AND JUST POSSIBLY TH=
E=20
SMALLNESS OF HIS OWN VOCABULARY" (Silliman on Spicer).  All that is missing. =20
All that is missing are the authors.   "Pure language is to Benjamin what th=
e=20
Martians are to Spicer."  Abbott:  "I want to stretch my feelings / out like=20
one clean note of music, endlessly. / One long note to be a bridge / for=20
someone."  Blaser:  "But given our social and political condition--that of=20
the entire twentieth century, but particularly of the Spicer period and=20
continuing--the disarray of our knowledge, the acknowledged difficulty of ou=
r=20
love life, it is a 'language which has no property.'"  (In the photograph,=20
turning to Ron):  "This is already in my notes before I heard you with that=20
business of no property.  The pure word, this notion of pure word attaches t=
o=20
a language that has no property.  This is not the English misreading of=20
Mallarme=04=04=04=04=03=B4 at all, and we must be careful of it (in fact, Ma=
llarme=B4 is=20
not at all found in an English reading of him.  And so without property his=20
beloved language[.]"  Jack:  "his name . . . (if it was his name)."  Steve: =20
"Bent and shaped by necessity."

There is an epistemological Spicer.  "There is no Pacific Ocean."  Ron's=20
concentration on the fragility of naming moves me in response down another=20
reading of Jack's last page marching "Toward / A necessity which is not love=20
but is a name."  What is its name?  It can't be said that it has--or once=20
had--"gaining and losing something with each transformation."  The naming of=20
Trotsky--an opening which makes possible the recuperation of the Left=20
Opposition in the U.S. which emerged at the end of the 1920s in immediate=20
response to the collapse of the October Revolution.  The vitality and=20
relevance of this tradition next to invisible in the cultural sphere has bee=
n=20
obscured by the Zukofsky/Oppen orientation toward American Stalinism.  What=20
is it's name?  "The one nobody listens to is speaking.  He makes mistakes. =20
Impossible to improve."  "We have come on to the stage stammering." =20
"Communsm."  "Humiliating in its disguises.  Tougher than anything."  The=20
last words at the end of the Spicer ACTS are Robin's:  "And I think it's a=20
very important passage, to know what kind of text we're taken back to.  It i=
s=20
further important to know that the two out of all these people that I admire=20
most, Derrida and Foucault, make themselves amazingly immortal.  We=20
absolutely can't do what they want us to do after they die.  Derrida is stil=
l=20
alive so we're safe for awhile [laughter].  Anyway, thank you very much."  I=
n=20
the spirit of that, here is the dedication to the "Spectres of Marx" in a=20
different context, i.e, how to read through the negative imprint of=20
domination, which involves an articulation of "proletarian" as not (only) a=20
content--timidity, fragility, subordination--lines painfully clawed=20
out--argues for a renewed engagement within a larger social context.

"One name for another, a part for the whole:  the historic violence of=20
Apartheid can always be treated as a metonymy.  In its past as well as in it=
s=20
present.  by diverse paths (condensation, displacement, expression, or=20
representation), one can always decipher through its singularity so many=20
other kinds of violence going on in the world.  At once part, cause, effect,=20
example, what is happening there translates what takes place here, always=20
here, wherever one is and wherever one looks, closest to home.  Infinite=20
responsibility, therefore, no rest allowed for any form of good conscience. =20
But one should never speak of the assassination of a man as a figure, not=20
even an exemplary figure in the logic of an emblem, a rhetoric of the flag o=
r=20
of martyrdom.  A man's life, as unique as his death, will always be more tha=
n=20
a paradigm and something other than a symbol.  And this is precisely what a=20
proper name should always name.  And yet.  And yet, keeping this in mind and=20
having recourse to a common noun, I recall that is as a communist as such, a=20
communist as communist, whom a Polish emigrant and his accomplices, all the=20
assassins of Chris Hani, put to death a few days ago, April 10th.  The=20
assassins themselves proclaimed that they were out to get a communist.  They=20
were trying to interrupt negotiations and sabatoge an ongoing=20
democratization.  This popular hero of the resistance against Apartheid=20
became dangerous and suddenly intolerable, it seems, at the moment in which,=20
having to decided to devote himself once again to a minority Communist Party=20
riddled with contradictions, he gave up important responsibilities in the AN=
C=20
and perhaps any official political or even governmental role he might one da=
y=20
have held in a country freed of Apartheid.

Allow me to salute the memory of Chris Hani and to dedicate this lecture to=20
him."

Allow me to salute the memory of Steve Abbott, and to dedicate Proletariaria=20
to him. =20

Jason Pettus has written a terrific letter about the recently completed
National Poetry Slam -- check out http://poetry.about.com.

With Juliette Torrez's retiring "Channels," the poetry.About.com site is
searching for new Newsletter writers/editors. Holman's idea of "Curriculum
for the Soul" is still on tap -- and could become the base for a new
poetry.About approach.

Ideas, writings, energy welcome.

Charles Macaulay was the partner of the late LA poet and editor Leland
Hickman -- they were both wonderful people.

Ron

Charles Macaulay, an actor and director prominent in theater but best
remembered for his role as the hapless prosecutor facing the perpetually
successful defense attorney played by the late Raymond Burr in a number of
``Perry Mason'' movies, died in Sonoma County of cancer last Friday at the
age of 72.

Mr. Macaulay, a close friend of Burr's and an administrator of his
multimillion-dollar estate, had been a partner and resident of the Raymond
Burr Vineyards in Sonoma County.

William Talman played the frustrated District Attorney Hamilton Burger in
the original 1957-65 ``Perry Mason'' television series. But Mr. Macaulay
assumed the role for a group of TV movies in the 1980s and early '90s after
starting as the judge in ``Perry Mason Returns'' in 1985.

Mr. Macaulay appeared in about 200 television shows, including episodes of
``I Spy,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``The Wild, Wild West,'' ``Mission: Impossible,''
``Gunsmoke,'' ``Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' ``Columbo'' and the soap opera ``Days
of Our Lives.'' He also acted in a couple of dozen feature films.

Mr. Macaulay was also a respected stage actor. Born and raised in Kentucky,
he was trained at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Upon graduation,
he won the First Judges Medal and received notes of congratulation on his
performance in ``The Heiress'' from the British actors John Mills and John
Gielgud.

Mr. Macaulay made his New York debut in 1952 in Somerset Maugham's ``The
Sacred Flame'' and for a number of years worked on the East Coast,
performing in seven Broadway plays, six off-Broadway productions and more
than 70 live television programs, including ``Armstrong Circle Theater'' and
``Studio One.'' He also played in various summer stock companies and acted
in the Barter Theater opposite Dame Judith Anderson.

Among the plays in which he appeared were ``The Winslow Boy,'' ``Bell, Book
and Candle,'' ``Man and Superman'' and ``The Dark Is Light Enough.''

He also performed Shakespeare and played the title role in ``Macbeth'' and
Benedick in ``Much Ado about Nothing'' at the Old Globe Theater in San
Diego.

Mr. Macaulay taught at the University of Southern California School of
Theater from 1986 to 1992.

registered in the maximum and never close to servile, the miners strew the
path of Modern Poetry with every pleasing new gimmick they can disinter.
they insist on the value of community within the adjudicating structure that
represents (always represents) the latest formality, keyed as that formality
is to strictures of time space and body odour. they bring a broad-based
whimsy to their every action: initiating Who Do You Love sequences with a
deftness to carry mountains. or how about the Visions of Vocabulary rooting
each new trouble in a prime, central Caring. there are no checkered careers
anymore, nor careers, for that matter, just the latest troopers surging
forward with the next thing to last forever, somewhere in the curve up
ahead, as if forever weren't filling up fast. Who Do You Love? the miners
demand, banging their tools to Bo Diddley's beat. and they mean eros love
and they mean happen to like: paramours and auteurs, frescos and frameworks,
peace eye and bookstore. majestic would be the label, tho in the private,
mining community sense of: back to work.

>>> R M Daley <R.M.Daley@M.CC.UTAH.EDU> 08/13/99 04:45pm >>>
>>>1. please see sedgwick's intro to Novel Gazing, puclished Duke
Press 1997
for a primer on "queer theory" which departs ferociously from, says a
thousand goodbyes to, freud and his cronies whose arrested sexual
(theory)
development  foisted repression on any and everything not deemed
'natural'
or 'biological'


Is that what Sedgwick is saying?  She uses the word "natural" only
once, about the pleasure/reality principles, and for that, she places it in
(ironic?) scare quotes: "This leaves pleasure-seeking as an always . . .
underground wellspring of supposedly 'natural' motive" (p. 16).

As far as "his cronies", what about the Melanie Klein Sedgwick takes
half her title from ("Reparative") and champions?

I don't know if I would call it a "primer"; to me, it seems a rather fine
hermeneutical point she's sifting.  And neither Sedgwick nor queer
theory are that proscriptive: she repeatedly advocates a kind of
scholarly libertinism ("turns these essays take away from existing
accounts of how 'one' ~should~ read, and back toward a . . . fecund
question of how one ~does~", p. 2; "for someone to have an unmystified,
angry view of . . .  systemic oppressions does not . . .  enjoin on that
person any specific train of epistemological or narrative consequences",
p. 4).

Yet, the queer theory people I personally knew in 1997 took considerable
umbrage at Sedgwick's dictating to the community, labelling them.  There
are good reasons to take exception with her "Paranoid Reading and
Reparative Reading".

Sedgwick seems to be taking her psychoanalysis menu-style, picking
and choosing which Freudianisms she'll keep and which throw out.
Even if, as you say, she's expurgating repression (repressing
repression), the whole essay is, of course, about nothing less Freudian
than--- paranoia!  That's like saying no USA, but keeping Washington,
D.C.

Which still doesn't keep Kathryn Bond Stockton and Anne Chandler, to
name only two of the essayists in ~Novel Gazing,~ from going right
ahead and using their fill of Freud for their queer theory (50-51, 224n).

All the same, hasn't Sedgwick's new and improved model 1999
~Dialogue on Love~ out-trumped her own 1997 "Paranoid Reading . . ."
into obsolescence, as far as repression goes?  1997: she may have had
motives for rhetoric against queer theory's (other writers') reliance on
psychoanalysis and repression,--- but when, 1999, it came to her
memoirs and 'fessing up as to how she actually spent those years, she
has no bones about publishing transcripts (cut-ups!) from psychotherapy
sessions where she ~paid~ to unveil her own personal repressions.
Doesn't that seem like double standards, prohibitive queer theory (no
repression) versus indulgent private praxis (yes repression)?


Regardless, when I added "I mean this as queer theory, . . . which is
always ~speculative"~ as the last sentence to my post (Sedgwick
wrote: "there are important phenomenological and theoretical tasks that
can be accomplished only through local theories and nonce taxonomies;
the . . . mechanisms of their relation to stronger theories remains the
matter of art and ~speculative~ thought", p. 23), maybe you're right and
it's not queer theory; I shouldn't have blushed: I tossed that in as
apologetics only because I was afraid someone might think what I wrote
was "anti-gay." --- I wrote, "it's commutative, not ~additive",~ and
Sedgwick wrote, "The desire of a reparative impulse . . . is ~additive~
and accretive" (p. 27): the two differentiations don't really seem that far
apart to me.

But even if I am mistaken, she's already gotten there ahead of us: "'the
importance of 'mistakes' in queer reading and writing . . . has a lot to do
with loosening the traumatic, inevitable-seeming connection between
mistakes and humiliation. . . . (A) lot of queer energy, later on, goes into .
. . practices aimed at taking the terror out of error, at making the making
of mistakes sexy, creative, even cognitively powerful" (p. 25).

Maria Damon, for one, seems to agree about Earl Jackson that a good
connection between "the homosexualization of the New York
avant-garde" and cut-ups can at least be argued.  Are you saying there
is no connection?


>>>3. not everyone has to have babies - some women don't have babies
- some women who fuck with men don't have babies - some women
who fuck with women don't have babies - some women who  fuck men
have babies and then give them away - . . .

Gertrude Stein couldn't have said it better. (I did identify "the childless
homosexual" as a fallacy.) True, all exhaustively true.  But that's
empiricism.  I was speaking hypothetically.

ANNOUNCING THE THIRTY-NINTH
ANNUAL FALL DEEP SOUTH WRITERS CONFERENCE
CREATIVE IMAGINATION AND "THE LOCAL"
SEPTEMBER 23-26, 1999

It is our pleasure to announce the 39th Annual Deep South Writers
Conference, which will take place from September 23rd to September 26th,
1999, on the University of Southwestern Louisiana campus in Lafayette.
This year the conference will explore a theme that we feel must interest
every writer--the part played by the "local" in the things we write.
Whatever the "local" means to you--connections to your family, your town
or region, the feeling you get from your native bayous, plains, deserts,
mountains, seascapes, or urban complexity, your racial, national, or
ethnic identifications, or the bonds that tie you to a group of people
on the basis of gender, age, writerly style, or some other shared set of
values or interests--it has enriched writers throughout the world for as
long as poems have been recited and stories told. The fact that the
local feels specially precarious now--that many contemporary writers
feel rootless and groundless--just intensifies the significance of the
local in what we do, and makes it even more important that we devote
this Deep South Writers Conference to understanding it better.
   We’ve felt one effect of this theme already--this year’s group of
visiting artists have expressed tremendous interest in these ideas, and
consequently we’re looking forward to the liveliest program in years.
Here are some of the things we’ve got planned:

• an opening-night program featuring performances, presentations, and
discussions by two of Louisiana’s finest songwriters, Sam Broussard and
David Egan
• readings and workshops by visiting writers Mary Cappello, Toi
Derricotte, Jordon Pecile, and Virgil Suarez, and by USL’s brilliant
young star, George Clark
• a Sunday morning reading and discussion with USL Writer-in-Residence
Ernest Gaines
• a "Poetry Crawl" around some of the most interesting venues in the
lively Lafayette arts community
• a special workshop in teaching creative writing by Sandy Lyne of the
Inner Writer Program, emphasizing "Spirit of Place"
• panels relating the local to creative writing and writing pedagogy
• a panel of editors discussing what the local means in their
publications

OUR FEATURED WRITERS

MARY CAPPELLO, poet and  associate professor of English at the
University of Rhode Island, is the author of Night Bloom, a critically
acclaimed memoir that focuses on her coming of age in the working class
suburbs of Philadelphia. Published in 1998, Night Bloom proves
Cappello’s uncanny talent to reanimate the past with a fierce and honest
pen. She reconstructs the rough road of her Italian-American family’s
experiences in the United States, ranging from her immigrant forbears to
the present-day events of her own life. In a New York Times review,
Cappello’s poetic style is heralded for its seamless transitions between
past and present: "[Her] writing shines and like the flowers she
cherishes, offers fleeting glimpses of beauty".
   Cappello’s poetry has appeared in Philomel, Full Moon, The Painted
Bride Quarterly, The Paterson Literary Review and The American Poetry
Review. Her recent readings include the University of Rochester (New
York) where she headlined for the Plutzik Series.

GEORGE MAKANA CLARK was brought up in Zimbabwe, of British and Xhosa
descent. He served in both the South African Defense Force and the
United States Army. He has lived and worked in more than thirty nations
on four continents as a soldier, musician, journalist, professor, and
bush guide. He received a Ph.D. in Creative Writing from Florida State
University as a Kingsbury Fellow. Clark’s work has appeared in Zoetrope:
All Story, Glimmer Train, The Southern Review, The Massachusetts Review,
Black Warrior Review, Georgetown Review, Appalachee Quarterly, and
elsewhere. Two of his short stories were selected for inclusion in "The
100 Distinguished Stories" section in The Best American Short Stories of
1998, and one received an honorable mention in The O’Henry Awards: 1998.
Francis Ford Coppola has purchased two options on Clark’s fiction. His
collection of short stories, The Small Bees’ Honey, was published in
1998 by White Pine Press.
   Clark currently teaches fiction writing at the University of
Southwestern Louisiana. He lives in Lafayette with his wife, daughter,
two dogs, two cats, and an extended family of peach-faced and seafoam
love birds.

TOI DERRICOTTE is the winner of the Folger Shakespeare Library Poetry
Book Award, the Lucille Medwick Memorial Award, a Pushcart Prize, and
the Distinguished Pioneering of the Arts Award from the United Black
Artists, as well as two fellowships from the National Endowment for the
Arts. Born in Detroit, she received her BA from Wayne State University,
spent several years teaching mentally retarded and psychologically
disturbed children in the Detroit public schools, and then moved to New
York and received her masters degree in Literature and Creative Writing
from NYU. For nearly twenty years she worked as a master teacher in the
highly esteemed New Jersey Poets-in-the-Schools Program.
   Derricotte has published four books of poetry, Tender, Captivity,
Natural Birth, and The Empress of the Death House, and has also
published widely in award-winning journals such as American Poetry
Review, Callaloo, The Iowa Review, and Ploughshares. Her lyrical,
powerful poems often focus on racial tensions and violence in urban
America. She describes her recently published memoir, The Black
Notebooks: An Interior Journey, as an attempt to tell the truth about
racial passing: "All my life I have passed invisibly into the white
world. . . . I never told anyone I was white. I just didn’t tell them I
was black.  . . . To show myself in this unfavorable light is to say,
‘Let’s talk about the things that racism makes us do. Let’s talk about
the imperfect choices it drives us to.’"
   Derricotte has taught creative writing at Old Dominion, George Mason,
and the University of Pittsburgh. She is currently Visiting Professor of
English at Xavier University.

JORDON PECILE, winner of the Governor Wilbur Cross Award for Outstanding
Work in the Humanities for 1998, has been the head of English at the U.
S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut for ten years. His
short stories about growing up as an Italian American in the coal mining
region of northeastern Pennsylvania have been published in the Atlantic
and other magazines, and he is collecting them into a book, Obsequious
Sorrows, Unmanly Griefs. For PBS’s American Masters Series, he has
written a documentary, "The Eye of Memory," about the rich, full life of
Katherine Anne Porter, who as a young woman lived in Lafayette.
   His most recent work for television, "Eugene O'Neill's New London,"
won the Bronze Award in the 17th Telly Awards, 1996, and is shown
regularly on Connecticut Public Television. He has been script
consultant and literary advisor for television films about Eugene
O'Neill and for the acclaimed series, "The American Short Story on
Film." His work for radio includes the 90-minute program, "Wallace
Stevens: Poet with the Blue Guitar," which won First Prize for Creative
Use of the Medium from the Information Film Producers of America, 1980.
His other work for public radio includes adaptations of Kate Chopin's
story, "Desiree's Baby," set in the countryside near Lafayette, of "The
Open Boat," by Stephen Crane, and of some classic stories by the French
writer Marguerite Yourcenar, presented as a 90-minute drama, "Four Women
in Love," which he also directed.

   New York’s Newsday hailed VIRGIL SUAREZ’S Latin Jazz as "[A] striking
debut. A well crafted and sensitive novel. Suarez is marvelous." Kirkus
Reviews hails Suarez as a leading spokesperson for his generation of
Cuban Americans, admiring his writing as "an exploration of fundamental
tensions in a community for whom Suarez is becoming an eloquent voice."
Publishers Weekly sums it up best with their simple statement, "Suarez
sparkles."  He has published novels (Latin Jazz, The Cutter, Havana
Thursdays, and Going Under), collections of stories and non-fiction
(Welcome to the Oasis and Spared Angola: Memories from a Cuban-American
Childhood), and poetry (Garabato Poems). Born in Havana in 1962, the
only son of a sweatshop patterncutter and piecemeal seamstress, Suarez
came to the United States twelve years later, and received an MFA in
creative writing from LSU in 1987. His work explores the themes of
immigration, identity, dislocation and acclimatization to life and
culture in the United States. The tenuous ground between foreign and
native, exile and acceptance, is the basis for numerous stories,
translations, essays, and poems published in literary journals such as
Ploughshares, Prarie Schooner, TriQuarterly, Colorado Review, American
Literary Review, and The North American Review.
   An active book reviewer for The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald,
The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Tallahassee Democrat  as well as
editor of several best-selling anthologies of Latino/a literature,
including Iguana Dreams: New Latino Fiction, Paper Dance: 55 Latino
Poets, and Little Havana Blues, Suarez is now a professor of creative
writing at Florida State University. He lives with his wife and
daughters in Tallahassee.

SPECIAL FEATURE! LOUISIANA SONGWRITERS SHOWCASE

This year’s conference will open on Thursday night, September 23rd with
the first ever Deep South Songwriters Night. We are pleased to present
two of the finest songwriting talents this musically rich area has to
offer, featured artists David Egan and Sam Broussard.

   DAVID EGAN was born in Shreveport, LA, and studied jazz and
composition at North Texas State University. He worked as pianist with
A-Train, Joel Sonnier, Filé, and the Louisiana Hayride Band. As a
songwriter his work has been covered by Joe Cocker, Percy Sledge, John
Mayall, Mavis Staples, Johnny Adams, Irma Thomas, Marsha Ball, Tracy
Nelson, and many more. He resides in Lafayette, and tours with Filé.
Egan’s recent work can be heard on Filé’s latest album, La Vie Marron.

   SAM BROUSSARD has been a distinguished fixture of the Lafayette arts
community for many years as poet, song-writer, and guitarist in a wide
variety of musical contexts. He is currently working at home in
Lafayette on two CDs, preparing for the performing songwriter circuit
after winning two major songwriting competitions, the Wildflower Arts
and Music Festival in Dallas and the Colorado Composers Classic. His
songs have been recorded by Franco-Swiss rock star Stephan Eicher, and
he has worked both with contemporary musicians in jazz and rock
(including such artists as Jimmy Buffett, Michael Martin Murphy, and
Zachary Richard) and with traditional Cajun and zydeco musicians.

   We invite all writers and music enthusiasts alike to come out and
meet these two talented artists. After performing their work, Egan and
Broussard will talk about the way their local roots and culture affect
their own music and the music of other songwriters they know. Then
they’ll welcome questions from the audience.

PANELS

Once again this year, the Deep South Writers Conference will present
panels designed to allow conference participants to express their
concerns and interests as writers and scholars. While all details have
not been concluded as of this date, we expect a variety of presentations
on the place of the "local" in creative writing pedagogy, and in our
writing in general. Once again, the USL Folklore Program will present a
panel that will examine such local effects on the literary as "Boudreau
and Thibodeau" jokes and the physical landscape of this region, with
special attention to the relation between the New Roads area and the
work of Ernest Gaines.

SPECIAL FEATURE: PANEL OF EDITORS

In addition, we have invited a group of literary editors from a variety
of publishing organizations for an open and frank discussion of the ways
in which the "local" affects their editorial strategies and decisions.
The roster will include:

  Chair: Skip Fox
  Literary Journal: Jack Bedell (Louisiana Literature) and
    William Lavender (New Orleans Review)
  Daily Newspaper: Walter Pierce (The Daily Advertiser)
  University Press: [We’re still working on this one.]

INTENSIVE WRITING WORKSHOPS

Once again Deep South will offer intensive writing workshops for
conference participants, encouraging helpful response and fresh
criticism on manuscripts in progress. Workshop registrants will critique
their own work as well as the work of their peers under the guidance of
experienced writers. Writers of all levels are encouraged to enroll.
Participants receive copies of each others’ manuscripts in advance with
instructions on how to review and respond to them. Intensive writing
workshops will be conducted by Toi Derricotte and Darrell Bourque in
poetry, by Virgil Suarez and George Clark in short fiction, by Mary
Cappello in non-fiction, and by USL professor Sylvia Iskander in
children’s fiction. And because of last year’s extraordinary interest,
we have doubled the number of Beginners Workshops in Fiction and Poetry,
directed by graduate students of the USL Creative Writing Program.
Finally, the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana will
sponsor a workshop for poetry and fiction in French. Enrollment in the
workshops is limited to twelve participants per workshop on a first-come
basis, and involves a supplementary fee (see Registration form for
details). If the demand for workshops exceeds expectations, additional
workshops will be scheduled.

VERY IMPORTANT!! WRITERS WISHING TO ENROLL IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE
WORKSHOPS SHOULD REGISTER AND SEND THEIR MANUSCRIPTS BY SEPTEMBER 15TH
(WE MUST RECEIVE THEM BY THIS DATE IN ORDER TO MAKE COPIES FOR ALL
PARTICIPANTS!) TO:

Dr. Jerry McGuire
Deep South Writers Conference
English Department, Box 44691
Lafayette, LA 70504-4691.

For poetry manuscripts, please submit 3 poems, typed. For prose
manuscripts, submit up to 12 pages typed, double-spaced.

SPECIAL FEATURE! WORKSHOP BY SANDY LYNE
OF THE INNER WRITER PROGRAM: "SPIRIT OF PLACE"

   Sandy Lyne has taught poetry writing to over 40,000 young people and
several thousand classroom teachers. He is a frequent presenter of
workshops to teachers nationwide through the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts. His collection of poems by young people, Ten-Second
Rainshowers (Simon & Schuster), has been showcased twice on National
Public Radio. A new collection, Soft Hay Will Catch You, will be coming
out in the year 2000 (also from Simon & Schuster). His own poems have
appeared in numerous journals, including The American Poetry review, The
Virginia Quarterly Review, Poetry East, Ploughshares, and Louisiana
Literature.  His poems have also appeared in two anthologies of American
poets, Quickly Aging Here (Doubleday) and Shake the Kaleidoscope (Simon
& Schuster) and in two collections, The Invention of Dragons and The
Love of Simple Things. He lives in Lafayette.
   His workshop at Deep South will be valuable for anyone interested in
making poetry available and fun for others. He will lead a discussion of
ways to use the "spirit of place" to help students and children (and the
adults in the workshop, too) improve their connection to the sources of
their poems.

WRITERS CRAWLING EVER UPWARDS!!!!!

In response to great demand from last year’s participants, the graduate
students in the Creative Writing Concentration will once again host
their open-microphone reading for all conference participants as a
traveling caravan through selected venues in the Lafayette community.
After Saturday night’s reading by Virgil Suarez and Toi Derricotte,
we’ll tour the local arts/literary scene, giving open readings as we go.
Last year we read at a coffee house, a restaurant, and an art gallery,
and we expect another lively night of eating, drinking, and reading
poetry and prose. As a special touch, we’ve asked three of the finest
young performance poets in the state--Christian Champaigne from New
Orleans, Clara Connell from Baton Rouge, and Bernard Pearce from
Lafayette--to read their work and serve as emcees at our three venues.

THE DEEP SOUTH WRITERS CONFERENCE CONTEST RESULTS

As in years past, the winners of the Deep South Writers Conference
Contest will be honored at a special ceremony preceding Friday night’s
reading by Mary Cappello and George Clark. The winning authors in the
categories of Short Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, Children’s Fiction,
Novel, French Poetry, and French Prose will be announced, as will the
winners of the Ethel Harvey Award (Nonfiction), the John Z. Bennett
Award (Poetry), the Paul T. Nolan Award (One-Act Play), and the James H.
Wilson Award (Full-Length Play). Winners, contenders, and future
hopefuls are encouraged to attend the ceremonies. After the reading,
we’ll caravan to Judith Meriwether’s house for refreshments.

SUNDAY BREAKFAST

Every year we try to arrange some events for Sunday Morning to open our
eyes and send us home happy. This year we have two events--the panel of
editors described above, and a special appearance by USL’s distinguished
Writer-in-Residence, Ernest Gaines, who will read from his fiction and
answer questions about the place of the local in his extraordinary body
of writing. We’ve been promised a breakfast of home-made cornbread, fig
preserves, and Steen syrup, so be prepared.

CONFERENCE REGISTRATION: HOW TO BE A PART OF THE WEEKEND

There is a $40.00 registration for the conference which rises to $50.00
after September 15th. The Deep South Writers Conference is one of the
most affordable writing conferences in the United States, due in large
part to the support received from sponsors, without whom a gathering of
talent like this would not be possible. The program is supported by a
grant from the Louisiana Division of the Arts, by a Partnership Award
from the Acadiana Arts Council, and by the Department of English and the
College of Liberal Arts at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. But
the greatest measure of The Conference’s success continues to be the
enrollment of writers who wish to contribute to and benefit from such a
gathering. Registration (see attached schedule and registration form)
includes lectures, panel discussions, and special events. For more
information, interested writers and artists may contact Jerry McGuire at
318-482-5478, or by email at jlm8047@usl.edu, or write to:

Last year I asked for suggestions for works for a Critical Writing
Workshop that I was teaching in the fall. And many people gave me great
suggestions. Some of the suggestions I am using in the workshop. Some of
them I'm not using, but enjoyed reading.

Just wanted to say thanks all now that I've done a version of the
syllabus.

The syllabus is at http://www2.hawaii.edu/~spahr if anyone wants to see
the results.

eve


sometimes we'd speak late in the midwest afternoon when the sun shot like
yellow foam, brittle and harsh, across the dying fields, he'd turn to me,
it wasn't all that long ago, there were still those few dark specks in the
sky, those broken stalks, those leaves, i remember, i'd be waiting ...
sometimes there will be a whole damn text, he said, taking the cigarette
out of his mouth for one last time in this godforsaken world, a whole damn
text with noise elements scattered all through it like argonauts in that
field, and there will be the slightest point in the world, here he looked
up at the sun and sky falling on the baked-stone earth, crops withered and
gone just like that another year, corn silk drab like radiation-hair,
crashed out, there will be this slightest point, and all the noise pro-
vides a framework for it, an exegesis so to speak, as if it were enough,
as if it added to the point being made, there were thin black birds above/
beyond/just about everywhere, looking for the last seeds in the world,
dust-devils in the distance, bird-throats parched and silent, uncanny
isn't it, he said, the silence, then again, all the noise in the text, as
i was saying, what would that be about, what would that point be then?,
here he looked at me, waiting, and as I said nothing, he continued, well
it's a requirement, sense of space, you could turn it around, god's signa-
ture, so i'm told, he looked at me directly now, is everywhere, more in
the noise than the silence i fill with my scrabblings, turned and saun-
tered away as if that was all there was to it, nothing more to be said

Pieces of a Great Design Future:  soft identities for identification and
cross-identification effects resocialized in a filter that takes up the lines
of rupture between biographical reality and implications not clear in the
(off-the-cuff) commentary.  Let the sun shine in.  The Talmudic aspect of
Dodie's interaction asserting the commentary is open for interpretation right
then and there with the impulse-energy of Pica's intervention in Drylongso
("Bitch, what the fuck are you talking about.")  I am not sure of this (role)
gender-switched, a Bitch, formerly "Bastard" (a speculative, or Zhenodtel,
moment).  My first instinct is to remember Rattray's comment on Crevel:
"But when those working-class guys (Bellamy and her circle of young poets)
showed up from the factory with their own script, he recognized he was in a
world all his own, out of touch and full of shit."  'My' Steve Abbott is of
course a narrow, ideological (even dogmatic) reading across SOUP 1-4 and the
ACTS "Conversations with Aliens" (manifest double-consciousness immersed in
the identity of the master) based basically on a hunch that if the
Conversations were translated into Hungarian a reader from Budapest, for
example, would hear Jozsef--a hunch based on a notion about moments of buried
time and finding an originary home of a proletarian expressionism.  This is
why permission must be asked of Steve Abbott's community--one of the first to
register the kicks and blows and even, fatality, in the increasingly crisis
laden physical spaces we inhabit--to lift this author's name into a
dedication to a book of poems rooted in conflict, class conflict, and yes,
I've wandered around the web site, "a-paul-ed" as Mary Engle would say, by my
being unable to find anything in the biographical materials remotely
resembling what I needed to imagine might be there, something close to the
profound human squalor of my own child-home.  What is the fulcrum between the
imagined and the real?  The Derrida passage on Chris Hani helped me out a lot
on the 'martyrdom' schtick (that and the news that a local hate-group here
was calling a killed vice-cop a Law and Order "Martyr").  Speaking out,
Bellamy reminds me of my own impatience and anger at the editorial
boundaries/frame of Moscow editions of Lenin, whose footnotes tend to convey
an irreality similar to the shadows cast in the comment gratefully updated.
A news update.  Good news.  News of poets reinterpreting the underground as a
place where the sun really does shine AND NARRATIVE AND a message from
Russia!  Masha, the best I can respond in the interface between a historian's
scholarship on Revlutionary Russia from the University of Akron and your
first-person historical experience is to appeal to the question of
translation, cultural translation, in which I find the Zhenodtel (a project
Clements writes was abolished by Stalin in 1930) (though perhaps it survived
in name but not in content) helpful for thinking about the problem of a
'school', even a school of so-called 'poetics,' where, really, there are
schools in every city in the U.S. that ought to be observed by an
international human rights organization.  A passage like the following I also
find useful for imagining alternative ways of living among each other:  "The
Zhenotdel's demise emerged from a similar transition in the Soviet Union.  By
the end of the 1920's, the party leadership had disavowed earlier proposals
for free love, communal living, and collective childrearing, proposals that
had always been dangerously unpopular with the Soviet people, particularly
the peasants.  Instead, the party endorsed premarital chastity and the
pattern of a nuclear family bound together by love, respect, and fidelity
between the spouses.  This Soviet conceptualization of the family marked a
compromise.  It was not simply traditional, for the Russian traditional
family had been extended rather than nuclear, and far more severely
patriarchal.  But neither did the new Soviet ideal go so far as Bolshevik
feminists such as Kollontai and Inessa [Armand] had wanted.  Repudiated were
their notions of intimate life transformed to promote individual sexual and
emotional fulfillment.  Instead, official spokespeople--propagandists and
party leaders--endorsed long-term monogamy and extolled its value to the
proper care of children." (from "The oneset of the Stalin era," pp. 275).
Your expression, "power-lusty," is one of those happy moments that occur in
the passages between two languages.  The concept that comes through is quite
familiar in critiques of patriarchal (dominative) matrices, though as a
counter-balance I keep the line "your my drives that do attend so well to
lust & thought" close to considerations of 'overstepping' or 'dominating' in
the performance of a strong identity in the labor of participating among
others in the development of ever larger collective identities, and proposing
with others alliances across essentialist constructions like gender and?

i walk the narrow defile with the valley to the right
the valley to the east, the valley to the south

hurt this writing until it cries, give it a read now and then
it doesn't matter much what happens to it

i'll be gone, nothing more to be said, you can pretend, can't you
there's a stream gone down the valley, down into a slit

you can find a grating there, open it with your key
crawl along, look for the manuscripts stacking the walls
if you play adventure, you'll know what i mean

they're precious as the daylight in this dim world
you can pretend you're reading at the very least
you'll find someone throwing a knife at you, DON'T THINK ABOUT ME

John Phillips has written to me about Cid Corman and I asked that he give me
permission to post a message to the list for him in Cid's behalf, which he
did, as follows.

Burt Kimmelman

                          CID CORMAN'S PLIGHT

I am writing to make people aware of the plight of Cid Corman. His situation
at the moment is precarious, to say the least. Doubtless it has always been
so, but presently it appears to be nearing crisis point. Uncertainty even as
to making it through the year.

I hope to reach poets / old time friends / academics/ readers / any one with
a voice that can speak out - to see whether there is a way open to putting
him forward for some kind of funding, grant or award.

A means for him to find the means to go on surviving.

It should hardly be necessary to make out a case as to the importance of the
work he has done - for so many years - through ORIGIN & ORIGIN PRESS,
publishing many of the seminal poets of the 20th Century - Creeley, Snyder,
Olson, Bronk, Eigner - the list goes on - or to the
  value and brilliance of his own poems & translations.

And yet Cid has remained almost invisible, his whole life - wholeheartedly -
dedicated to the poetry he believes life is.

However, invisibility - eventually - makes it hard to survive. And I have
felt an undercurrent of worry from him recently - and - as always with Cid -
his worry and concern comes out - perhaps first & foremost - for other poets
he could be helping, opening the world up to, were he
  able.

Yet the priority - I feel - at this moment - must be his own survival and
his own work.

This year, & finally, the 3rd vol. of OF - the summation of his life's work
& a book like no other - ever - was published. But there are 2 more volumes
that must still see the light of day. The only manuscripts of these are in
his flimsy house in Kyoto. I don't think the world of poetry - of those who
value poetry - and the human beings who create it - can rest easy knowing
that such a major work is in so vulnerable a position.

Especially taking into account the fact that even Cid remaining housed in
his rented accommodation is under some threat at the present time.

I hope - with enough support garnered - and with a volume of Cid's poetry
coming out from NEW DIRECTIONS in the fall - that there's a chance of
stirring up the necessary & vital funding. It could only be a question of
getting momentum going - telling people he is still alive
and writing a book a day!

At least - at last - a late recognition of his gift to poetry.

Surely enough folks being made aware of his plight would open eyes - hearts
- pull up a few of the floorboards where the bundles of cash are hidden for
worthy causes?

And I can think of few - if any - who have done as much for the world of
poetry as Cid. Maybe now the world of poetry should come together to help
him.

What do you reckon?

If you feel to make a response, perhaps giving hints as to places / people I
could go to for help, please email me: " John Phillips"
<jack_bedford@yahoo.com>

*

Alternatively - & even tho my real hope is to raise awareness of his plight
& gain access to some major funding - I realise there might be some reading
this who feel to make a small contribution of aid - directly to Cid. If so,
please contact me & I will gladly send you the necessary details.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi. Over the past month, numerous copies of the PBS/NPR funding
petition have been sent to the list by various subscribers. Here is a
very brief history lesson re this petition, taken from another list's
archive
<http://www.acu.edu/academics/music/archive/iawm.9707/0030.html>:

> The NPR/PBS petition was once a misguided, yet earnest effort of some
> undergrads at the University of Northern Colorado at Greely. Due to poor
> planning on their part and naievete about "things Internet", it blew up
> and turned into a "monster", similar to other Internet hoaxes, such as
> "Good Times Virus," "Nieman-Marcus cookie recipe," [...] and many
> others--all bogus!

Further information is available at the University of Northern Colorado
website <http://www.unco.edu/petition.html>:

> In 1995 two well-meaning but misguided students at UNC started an email
> petition regarding pending legislation that would affect the funding for
PBS
> and NPR. They didn't mean to open a can of worms, but they did. The
>  petition is still circulating on the Internet and has taken on a life of
its own.

In other words, while govt support of public media remains an issue,
this petition is not the solution.

Now, while I think this list can and should be a place where petitions
and information on matters political can be exchanged, I would urge
subscribers to read carefully and do a little research before submitting
any such thing to the list. Some guidelines might be:

        does the petition or press release contain a date?
        does it refer to other sources of information on the web or
elsewhere?
        what corroborating sources can *you* provide?
        what is the *most current* status of the issue in question?

In general, I think it would be more effective to have posts written
by subscribers to this list or direct acquaintances of same, and that
summarize an issue, provide further resources and contact information
(i.e., URLs, snail-mail and email addresses) for the parties involved.
Another possibility might be to do a little research and "pen" a
sample letter of protest which can be easily adapted by your fellow
subscribers. Activism of any kind quite simply requires more work
than any electronic petition would imply; the internet can be a
good tool to facilitate such work, but doesn't ultimately replace
sweat, tears, and song.

best, Chris

Charles was a consumate actor--and Lee met him when Lee was studying
theater in new york. Charles lent a wonderful ear to Temblor mag. and
helped Lee maintain what in LA and elsewhere was a truly brilliant
output. I'd like to add that anyone not familiar with lee's work--read
it. Jawbone press a few years back published Lee Senior Falls to the
Floor. I've rarely seen (in memory) a better reader and/or more noble
editor than Lee.

Just read the message about Cid on yesterday's digest, and I wanted to add
my own bit. This man should be an American national treasure. He is the most
unselfish poet I've ever had the pleasure to deal with, and has done more
for the poetry he loves than anyone alive. There must be some way for the
richest nation on earth to keep him alive and housed. That's it.

When I first met Charles Macaulay he and Leland Hickman invited me to
dinner when they lived in North Hollywood, and I went with Matias
Viegener, and it was very late and dark and Charles answered the
doorbell, and he looked so familiar I gave out an inadvertent, no not
scream, but a low moan.  Matias had the presence of mind to ask
Charles for his autograph, having recognized him from TV.  (Charles
played on several episodes of Star Trek, he was Jaris in "Wolf in the
Fold" and Landru in the "Return of the Archons" episode.")  He wasn't
a star, but because one had seen him so often on TV in sitcoms,
soaps, whatever, one felt one knew him so intimately and so
well--very different from meeting any other kind of stranger.

Of course he and Lee had the glamor of their close association with
Raymond Burr, one of Hollywood's more mysterious figures, ever since
I was a little boy watching Raymond Burr putting his wife in that
trunk in "Rear Window" or prosecuting poor Montgomery Clift in "A
Place in the Sun" before that.

Just last week I was trying to track him down to obtain permission
for Timothy Liu to reprint some of Lee Hickman's poems for the new
postwar gay male anthology planned by Talisman House Press.  And then
Lynda Claussen got on the case too (the Archive for New Poetry at
UCSD controls the copyrights, thank God, for Hickman's work) and she
sadly reported that Charles was in the hospital and wasn't going to
come out of it.

As Ron Silliman says, people do forget, it's only natural I suppose.
We've got so much on our brains all the time just trying to make it
from day to day.  "Born of the sun they travelled a short while
towards the sun,/ And left the vivid air signed with their honour."

the saddest thing is that people have forgotten Lee--who never forgot a
single soul. Again--I want to say that as a reader, editor, voice, poet,
Lee was without a doubt--the man. Perhaps it's this sad place call'd Los
Angeles that did not allow him the scope he might have had had he lived
"up north" or "back east". Sadly, things in LA are not much but
in-fights and such--and if Lee were here he wold have a BIGGER fight--as
he could make anyone cry or moan or laugh--but the persistency of his
DEDICATION is one truly lost. The poem was the thing. 7 page letters to
me about single poems he DIDn't like of mine--etc. I had the great
pleasure of helping a bit with Temblor--gettting it placed in shops in
SF--and he'd call THE NEXT DAY to see if any had sold or had I read the
entire thing last night?  He pushed where pushing belonged--reminding me
of Olson or Duncan--and certainly,, certainly, the core of the
work--always. Having taken me at twenty and said--read this--not "this
poet" --but---"this poem".
Lee was love.
simply. as love is surely
dedication (and song).

Keston Sutherland, a young British poet, e-mailed me this poem on Tuesday,
claiming that he "just can't keep [his] mitts off O'Hara" these days.  I've
known the problem myself, but O'Hara's only blushed, not bruised -- he's
done a greater disservice by his (hardcover) defenders, I feel.  In any
case, I thought it quite funny, bold, provocative, right and wrong, but
well-written:


AND TRY AGAIN

Dainty failure of the lyric,
rising with a tick of mellow
fury to an end that cloys,
fast as the food whose time it crowns.

Three key errors of Frelimo:
pushed too rapidly for heavy
industry and gave too little
support to the peasant sector.

Retained one-party state and govt.
structures of the colonial
era, centralized like those of
socialists in E. Europe.

Failed to predict how the climate
internationally would change:
second oil price rise, sharp rise in
interest rates, Frank O'Hara,

pathos, private recollection,
innovative cracks in grammar,
fetishistic ploy of leaving
meaning for the dogs to sigh on.

Brian, thanks for sending Keston's poem along.  You're right I think, much
well-written here.  But the O'Hara needling, I don't know...does it really
seem worthwhile to you?  To label O'Hara's grammar and motives as
"fetishistic" seems rather facile to me -- and to figure them as a "ploy"
not a little paranoid.  If "leaving meaning for the dogs to sigh on" is a
ploy on O'Hara's part, it strikes me as a pretty good one -- in which he,
say, de-authorizes his texts by figuring them as "meaningless" (or, more
precisely, "trivial") chat.  I won't belabor, lest I be seen as too much
the defender doing FOH disservice. Suffice to say, there is a Marxist
critique to be made vis a vis O'Hara's work (as well as, I think, a pretty
good rebuttal to such critique, though not a Marxist rebuttal as such) but
I don't think Keston's is it.    -m.

I want to second what Todd's been saying about Lee's value as a poet &
editor. Great Slave Suite is one of the really great texts. A shorthand, and
flip, synopsis might be something like "Maximus cruises the bar scene," but
what is so remarkable about this book beyond all its many individual lines,
stanzas, riffs, is that the text appears twice, once in the grand
architecture of the large poem and then again as a series of discrete
pieces. You really have to read it to see how well it works. I learned a lot
from that book.

My biggest argument with Lee -- and one that I had on several occasions --
was that he was so damned humble he would not include his own poetry in
Temblor.

It's really time for someone (O Books, Wesleyan, Sun & Moon??) to do a
collected books of Leland Hickman.

        As I hear say on the cellular grapevine these days
        wishful thinking whatever, but as I was saying
        comes again and forgets you as I was
        suggesting, leaves disobeying, mumbling
        to himself, whom he calls poet except of necessity
        unshaven, idiot, always fiddles with doorknobs
        taking off real slow and then gaining velocity,
        knowing not which way the heart’s habit throbs,
        but real smart fellow, look what he’s got
        and killed indefinite times over, not
        to mention a thousand times insolvently inspired,
        striking root in your thoughts inkling by inkling.
        The modern critics have long proclaimed him dead.
        Dim bulbs think they can deconstruct everything.

        IN RE THE DEATH OF THE AUTHOR 2

                                "The imaginary is as real as the real."
                                        From postmodern folklore.

        Mellow, declarative arbitration of
        and management of my ropy life affairs
        in academic poverty abrades
        the will to resolution. And so?
        Moi, je ne longer care.
        And as regards the literary sphere,
        it too is more like a funnel than a globe.
        I am, dear colleagues, no fop.
        Fresh mayo be upon
        your non-Euclidean iconoclastic clamp-on
        credentials. Boy,
        this book is giving me ideers. If only
        this silver autumn I could orchestrate
        my brave escape from here
        into another sphere,
        if only I could silence this parade
        of decadence into a more winged bender
        inside this lucid gender-blender.
        Where are all binary oppositions gone?

        There comes a day your life goes to the john
        and never comes back. Smoke of factories
        in eructating air thickens. The young
        umbrellas still bloom full of expectation.
        The heap of days lies multiplied by one.
        According to your essays and your stories,
        you’d seen the twitchy, twitchy side of things
        among the hiccuping magnolias once
        back in your fuck-up days as academic
        way off the tenure track in a state of
        underdress. Tremulously
        a radical conception in the literature
        becomes, then unbecomes a revolution.
        Your hands which once clasped the keyboard lie
        unnerved in the dispersal of your impact.
        Everything gets inverted. Bye,
        the sweetest bread critical tongues can buy.
        Bye-bye, the tenure track! Bye, MLA!
        They’re turning into chimney folks.
        I am ontologically telling you,
        this is yours, this is the real death of the author,
        dearest colleague.

Not to feed you all into the mass-alternative-media-maw without your
consent, but can anybody supply the crucial omitted bibliographical data for
the comment in re: William Stafford's "Traveling Through the Dark" as
mentioned by Donald Hall in the Sep 99 Harpers Forum "How to Peel a Poem":

Hall: The comma with "still" bothers me, because if the fetus is still how
do you know it's alive? Alive still? How does he know it's alive? I read
once from the speech of a Language poet who ridiculed this poem because it
was William Stafford saying, "I'm a nice guy. What a nice guy I am."

The other participants are quick to contradict this paraphrase-from-memory
as follows:

[Paul] Muldoon: I don't think that's what he's saying.
[Charles] Simic: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[Cynthia] Huntington: That's reductive.

In fairness to Hall, the forum is a transcript of a discussion of five poems
(by Thomas Hardy, Louis MacNeice, Frank O'Hara, William Stafford, and Ezra
Pound) over dinner at the Algonquin. Hall's unguarded moment is preserved as
just that. All the same, I would like to know whose comments are relayed
here, and where I can read them.

sequel to a similar (but much smaller) section that he edited about 4 years
ago - it looks really great - there is also an essay by Hank Lazer "Kudzu
Textuality: Towards a New Southern Poetry 2" - if anyone is curious to
what's happening in the south in terms of poetry this is surely the most
interesting statement to date

No, I think you're right that Keston's not got the last word on FOH here,
and we've been bunging each other pretty good e-mails over it.  But
regarding the poem, I didn't read the last quatrain as being an elaboration
on "Frank O'Hara" in the prior stanza, mostly because there's a comma and
not a colon seperating them -- had there been a colon, the next items would
have been a dependent list.  (The title of the poem argues otherwise, of
course.)  To me, FOH appears in a list of general economic statements that
are, in scale, much larger than he himself -- part of the humor of it, I
guess -- and the list continues on with other generalities, though with a
shift toward issues of poetics, so FOH, ironically, acts as the channeling
of these social issues into the aesthetic, though Keston is arguing that
his poetry diffused them.  But if you think of the final stanza as somehow
descriptive of the heirs of O'Hara, perhaps in Keston's idea even including
the Language poets, though maybe more surely latter New York school poets,
then O'Hara becomes -- due to other aspects of his writing as well,
including his synthesized and not-so-synthesized use of many continental
modernist methods that had their relevant links to politics of the left and
right -- a poet one can read politically (or let's say responsibly, as his
heroes were more responsible than political) without a reduction in
"pleasure" as folks like David Lehman would have it.  O'Hara, for some,
comes pretty close to pop art, in that he is seen as blindly assembling a
catalogue of how he spends his money and time, how much pleasure he finds
in living in the power capital of the world, how thoughtless and hapless
and light, etc., but also as an argument against pop art due to his
sentimentality, warmth, candour, pathos, etc. -- but he's really much more
than that if placed here, where Keston places him, I think (though it's
sort of where Pound placed Wordsworth, no -- a diluter?), in a sort of
economic nexus.  There are many arguments for why all those things appear
in his poems, but the most obvious one is the most vulnerable -- that he
spent his day doing things (nice things, fun things), and liked to write
them down.  It doesn't explain how the method works, though, relations to
liberated words and Mayakovskian apostrophe, etc.  Which means, in the end,
that some much better writing has to be done on this guy to wipe away that
terrible book which hopefully everyone's forgotten, The Last of the Avant
Garde.

Oh well, a ramble... but thanks for writing.

What Billy Mills says is true enough, but let me add that Corman's influence
on British and Canadian experimental poetry is a matter of record.  Indeed,
he first introduced Prynne to Olson.

Cid is an international literary figure, which means that donations from
every quarter would be gratefully accepted.

Unfortunately the richest nation on the earth, (not to mention the second
richest (Japan)) has turned a deaf ear to earlier versions of the laudable
effort currently in process.  I hope this one fares better.

Cid's position as a long-term expat in Japan makes it especially difficult
for him to remain in the grant-giving arena in the U.S.  Incredibly, Cid's
renowned translations from the Japanese and his position as a long-term
"cultural ambassador" has never been rewarded or even formally acknowledged
by the U.S. government.  Those who wish to help Cid Corman's cause may also
write a letter to the current American ambassador to Japan, pointing out
Cid's contributions to modern literature and to the dissemination and
understanding of Japanese culture, and how Cid is deserving of support.

Thanks to Jesse Glass for his suggestion that those of
us concerned (i.e., poets) write to the current American
ambassador to Japan re Cid Corman's situation.

This is exactly the sort of chance for some small political
efficacy I was trying to point out in my "note re petitions"
a few days ago. If even half of the people in this forum
sent such a letter, that would be 370+ letters - pretty
significant mileage for a few lines of email.

I wonder if anyone would volunteer to write a short
letter for public use in conjunction with glass' suggestion?
I will do it myself, if necessary, but would prefer it done
by someone who feels more readily able to speak to
the issue - someone who knows well the scope of
Corman's work and can make the argument effectively.
I might suggest further that any letter made available
here be made available elsewhere - on other lists, in
a zine or two.

July's Bard Symposium at the Institute for Writing and Thinking made
headlines in last Sunday's Boston Globe: See "Meeting takes on challenge
of teaching contemporary poetry" at
http://www.boston.com/globe/sunday/learning/


If part of the goal of the symposium was to create access to the
"difficult text," this certainly makes headway, providing from various
participants various metaphors for what 'postmodern' poems are
and how one proceeds with them, despite the fact that they are
here called poems "that can be interpreted infinitely" and pitted
against poems "that find commonly accepted meanings."  Isn't
infinity also a commonly accepted meaning?  Whereas it's not
solely about interpretation, as though that occurs without context.

More appropriate terms of distinction might run something like:
poems 'that come to mean through engagement with various,
uncommon non-determined structures' and poems 'that engage
meanings predetermined, pre-interpretted, and so common."

I am not sure (and I maybe missing some of the posts) why Cid Corman is in
a bad way  - but wouldn't it be wiser if there was a specific grant -
either in Japan or in America - and recommend him for that particular grant
-  than write to the ambassador to raise funds.  The Ambassador maybe be
able to suggest foundations, etc to raise money, but he doesn't have the
power to give money.

Also isn't there a major Japanese cultural award that gives out money for
international artists?  And if so, perhaps concentrate on sending letters,
support for Corman to receive that grant/award

There used to be an award from the NEA for something like a lifetime
achievement that was directed precisely at situations like Cid's. I know
that there was some discussion in the community about obtaining same for
Larry Eigner, but Larry put the kibosh to it out of a concern that he might
then lose his SSI income. I don't know if it still exists or not.

I certainly agree on Cid's importance. I was VERY fortunate back in 1966 to
read virtually all of the Origin collection that was then current and
available in the SF State Library (having had Blaser as a librarian up to
that moment had some real advantages!). In fact, the first critical writing
I did in any form was a review of a reading of Cid's for the UC Berkeley
student newspaper back around '69.

Another thought!  Why not approach the Lannan Foundation.  They are known
to give out liteary grants to specific writers who contribute...etc.
Perhaps if someone can draft up a letter (with signitures from this list
and others) and send it off to Patrick Lannan - that might be affective.

Right, your reading is the more exact, though, as you suggest, the "and so
on" aspect encourages one to read through, draw connections, etc.  More
below.

Yes - and I would add that we shouldn't constrict the definition of
political too much: true enough that one would be hard pressed to
construct an over-arching critique of Capitalism out of O'Hara's work (to
say the least!); but we can also be sure - damn sure - that O'Hara is
interested in / dedicated to radical democracy, a dedication which, for
instance, made him an early supporter of the Civil Rights movement.  This
is the O'Hara whom Baraka is talking about when he says that "Frank had a
political sense," or, as he recently put it to me, O'Hara was "a
sympathetic individual to all the just struggles in the world."  Now that
doesn't mean that one might not critique O'Hara's consumerism, say (Baraka
himself does, pointing out that O'Hara couldn't manage to let go of the
"crudely obvious joys of the corrupt West"), but it *does* mean that a
tacit dismissal of O'Hara's politics or lack thereof is, as I said before,
too cute and loaded with blindspots.  (This issue may be more clear to
those in American space where race/gender/sexuality tend to compete for
our radicals' attention on fairly equal footing with class). This in
addition to your good point that "It doesn't explain how the method works"
any more than *The Last of the Avant Garde* does.  We're in trouble,
needless to say, when we comfortably accept shallow gossip in place of
careful reading and thinking.  O'Hara, as Ginsberg put it, was always a
*deep* gossiper.

"Is there much difference between art and a fart?  The recently republished
1980 novel by eccentric French torch singer Serge Gainsbourg wonders just
that. 'Evgu=E9nie Sokolov' grew up ashamed of his chronic gas, but once he
learns how to make gasograms, he becomes the darling of the art world.
Sophomoric, giddy and insightful, this quick read proves just how well
Gainsbourg understood the science of selling controversy and the troubles
that come with being an enfant terrible."

I couldn't find much in the way of specific information
on awards made by the Lannan Foundation by searching
the www; evidently they have no site of their own. I did,
however, find a street address.

        Lannan Foundation
        725 Arizona Ave., Suite 200
        Santa Monica 90401-1734

        (310) 395-1492

Nor was I able to find any mention of monies given for
"lifetime achievement" and so forth at the NEA web
site; apparently this award has been discontinued.

The Lannan Foundation could be a good bet; I still
think there must be some other federal money available,
so wouldn't discount querying the ambassador - though
I agree that my earlier suggestion to bombard him with
mail was premature. I will write to the NEA this afternoon,
which is a simple query; again, I would suggest that
someone closer to the circumstance write a detailed
letter to the Lannan Foundation and to the U.S.
ambassador to Japan.

It's too bad The MacArthur Fellows Program only
accepts nominations from its designated nominators
in the U.S.; as a matter of course, their names are not
made public. MacArthur Fellows are given a 5-year
unconditional income of $30,000 - $75,000 annually,
plus comprehensive health insurance. The John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation seems to
be one of the only major grant-making foundations
that makes large gifts directly to individuals, rather
than making them to or through institutions. Previous
recipients include John Ashbery and Harold Bloom,
Ann Lauterbach, Robert Hass, Jorie Graham, etc.;
also Sandra Cisneros, Thomas Pynchon, Ishmael
Reed. Interestingly, I notice that Stanley Cavell rec'd
a fellowship at one time; as did Richard Rorty.

        The Phelps domain (godhatesfags) was bought out from under him by

an organization whose site is entitled "godlovesfags.com" -- This was all

Dear Tosh and everybody:

Cid did get a Lannan award several years back, if I'm not mistaken, and yes,
please put his name forward for any grants that you may be aware of.

Unfortunately, grants, the last time I checked, are a bit of a crap shoot,
and are particularly so for someone who has spent most of a long career
living in a foreign country.  As Cid himself told me this evening, the
awards go to scholars and artists coming in to Japan for short-term
residencies and are simply not available to permament residents.

Admittedly, the letter writing to Foley is a long shot, but the primary
reason why I suggested it (outside of Corman's obvious worthiness): is
because in Japan "official recognition" by government or academic agencies
often breaks the ice so that local (Japanese) sources of aid become
available, and it is a sad fact that Corman has not received much--if
any--help from  Japanese arts agencies.

Cid Corman, now in his 70's, lives in a tiny house in Kyoto.  His wife
Shizumi and her sister and brother run a shop called C & C's where they sell
sandwiches, beverages and ice cream.  This is their sole source of income.
(Corman's income from his writing is negligible.  In fact, Cid usually sends
the checks to other writers as "grants" because it costs more to cash the
check in a Japanese bank than what they're worth!)    Business is not so
good, and with everyone getting older, no pensions, and not much in savings
the future looks iffy to say the least.  Shizumi works seven days a week.
Soon she will have to retire.  After that, Cid says, he is not sure what
they will do.

That maybe a local office (Santa Monica) of the Lannan Foundation, but I
believe their main headquarters is in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  I know of Cid
Corman, but I don't know his work that well.  So I suggest that someone who
knows the work and history of Cid, should write the letter.  Also Cid
translated some Japanese classic literature, no?  If that's the case
perhaps he can get some funding from the Japan Foundation - which seems to
do cultural activity.  I don't know if they give money directly to
individuals.  Maybe just to non-profit organizations.

The NEA would take forever!  I don't know how strongly Mr. Corman needs
financial aid - but I do think it would be best to direct funding from
private foundations.  Also someone should bring this issue up with Pen.  As
well as with Poets & Writers, Inc.

The MacArthur Grant is fantastic.  But it is a secret process.  I guess one
could ask a past winner.

best,

The critique is in the September 1999 issue (cover story) of Harper's
Magazine.  Charles Simic, Paul Muldoon, Heather MacHugh, Donald Hall, and
someone else whose name has suddenly slipped my mind each picked a favorite
poem and then they critiqued each selection as a group. Simic chose the
Stafford poem largely because it was plain and yet subtly ironic while
leaving readers unsatisfied.  There was also an O'Hara poem critiqued
("Lunch Hour," I think).

Thanks for Jesse Glass's update!  I would still write a letter to Patrick
Lannan, because basically he is Lannan Foundation.  It is a private
foundation and I think he can pull strings if he's interested in doing so.

Perhaps Amb. Foley could pull some strings or at least arrange a 'letter'
to recommend Cid to get some funding.  I know it is very difficult time for
small shop owners in Japan - especially in Kyoto which must be very
expensive.

The person to speak to is Karen Clark at Poets & Writers Berkeley.  I think
she can honestly give information about the possibliity of Cid getting
grants and also additional information on organizations, etc.

best,

Assemble about $10,000.00 and buy NAVARRE (NAVR) on Nasdaq (Ed Dorn's favorite
exchange) for an account opened at your local Fidelity Brokerage in the name
of Cid Corman.  But you have to do it soon.

Catalina Cariaga
cultural EVIDENCE


Cultural Evidence is evidence that waves of the Asian Pacific can arrive
upon the sandy shores of American English. Cariaga is a poet alert to
written and oral traditions and what can be done to accommodate them in
the many directions that American poetry can take.
—Victor Hernandez Cruz


This deeply thoughtful assemblage from Catalina Cariaga documents the
search for cultural clues suggested by her title. She reveals her
generational memory both circumstantially and directly, where in her
childhood “the sea is a woman,” the barong (traditional shirt) is an
ironic symbol, and Billie Holiday, grunion, and the exact procedure for
citizen’s arrest—like a palimpsest—further define her point-of-view. Her
calm speech fragments stand in the present, but step—with serious
urgency—into this past, to trauma, the origins of identity, and her
inherited love of language. This is a brave, innovative, and ultimately
searing book.
—Joyce Jenkins


Catalina Cariaga is a pyrotechnic burst of light in the horizon of
American poetry. Cultural Evidence is a worthy book of poems for all
libraries and lovers of avant-garde literature.
—Nick Carbo



This first full length collection from Catalina Cariaga uses an
experimental, documentary poetics for profound and moving culture
observation. The poems here are critique, history, and personal
anecdote. “No Tasaday,” for example, examines the controversy
surrounding the Tasaday people of the Philippines (believed by some
anthropologists to be a tribe but now generally considered to be a
hoax). “The Mercy” mixes passages from an Ilocano and English grammar
book, the Bible, and a mother’s memories of her departure from the
Philippines.

Hey Bill Marsh,

I've been meaning to say great job on Steve Carll's Drug book (paper brain

far out.  Steve is doing some great work these days.

Here is a book review for an upcoming book on the Japanese
Surrealists. It is already listed at Amazon, but really won't be
available until November. Review is by Eric Selland.

___________



Book Review: Fault Lines: Cultural Memory and Japanese Surrealism , by
Miryam Sas, Published by Stanford University Press, 1999, 240 pages,
$18.95 paper, ISBN 0804736499.

Possibly one of the most significant developments in scholarship in
recent years is the willingness to view historical and cultural change
in non-western countries on their own terms, rather than exclusively
according to Western assumptions and expectations. We may be unable,
as the phenomenologist Gadamer points out, to wholly lay aside our own
cultural subjectivity, but we can at least listen to the voices of
others as they express their thoughts in their own words. Most often
in anthologies and biographical sketches the critical and theoretical
writings of modern Japanese poets have been ignored. Few studies
outlining the details of a particular poet’s thought as it effects
actual poetic practice have been produced in this country other than
outstanding exceptions such as Hosea Hirata’s work on the poetics of
Nishiwaki Junzaburo. With Miryam Sas’ groundbreaking study we are
given a clear, and even intensive sense of the Japanese Surrealists as
very much modern intellectuals in an active and passionate engagement
with the ideas of their time. The theoretical writings and
developments in the thought of such notables as Takiguchi Shuzo, who
introduced Surrealism to Japan through his translations of Breton as
well as his own writings, are covered extensively. Moreover, Sas
provides material here which leads not only to a deeper understanding
of the thought behind 20th Century Japanese literary movements, but of
the process of cultural transfer as well, in all its complexity and
ambiguity. Sas notes in her prologue that  “Japanese Surrealism is
striking and important both for the specific questions it raises and
for its exemplary place as an encounter between cultures, literary
movements, and languages.” Sas uses the title of her book, “Fault
Lines”, to denote how the introduction of Surrealism to Japan was,
like the great Kanto earthquake which occurred around the same time,
an occasion not only for literary “shock” and “rupture”, but a variety
of creative reconfigurations as well.

The book goes beyond a simple chronology of events as they occurred,
and instead takes up specific theoretical and often deeply
philosophical issues of concern to both French and Japanese poets,
showing in great detail how the Japanese poets dealt with these issues
within their own thought processes and poetic procedures. Both poetic
works and theoretical writings of major Japanese figures such as
Takiguchi Shuzo, Nishiwaki Junzaburo and Kitasono Katue, as well as
Surrealist forerunner Hagiwara Sakutaro are quoted and examined in
great detail. What is striking, as mentioned previously, is that those
of us already familiar in general with the works of these poets and
their lives are given a much stronger impression of them as brilliant
and important thinkers of their time. Takiguchi was both a major
theorist and translator of French poetry during his time, and an
examination of his work, as well as that of Nishiwaki Junzaburo,
brings up specific problems of language, meaning and translation, in
regard to which both these thinkers had a surprisingly subtle and
sophisticated understanding in a time when the linguistic and semiotic
theories those of us in the fields of language and literature now take
for granted were just barely being developed. We are also shown
exactly how cosmopolitan Japanese poets were before World War II by
the examples of the international activities of Kitasono Katue, who
corresponded with Ezra Pound for many years, and Takiguchi Shuzo who
shared his ideas with Breton during this time, finally visiting him in
person in Paris in 1958. Sas provides us with a rich selection of
samples of poems, theoretical writings and visuals in the appendix,
for those interested in reading these in more detail in the original.

One of the most important contributions this book brings to current
scholarship is the rediscovery of two nearly forgotten women
Surrealists -- Ema Shouko and Tomotani Shizue. These poets, along with
other women experimentalists of the pre-war period, have been almost
completely ignored until now, not only here but in Japan as well. A
major anthology of Japanese Modernist poets published in the 1969
(Gengo Kuukan, edited by Ohka Makoto) includes virtually no women at
all. Sas gives both these sensitive and intelligent poets the
attention they deserve, opening the way for further research on their
work, as well as other women experimental writers of the period.

Sas’ interest in Japanese Surrealism and its influence on later
experimental movements has led her in the direction of performance.
Hence the epilogue on one of the most important post-war developments
in the avant-garde in Japan, that of the Butoh, a new
dance-performance art form created by Hijikata Tatsumi. Sas examines
the writings and thought of the major artists here, including Ohno
Kazuo, and the various ways in which Surrealism, as well as the
Japanese Noh theories of Zeami have been adapted and interpreted.

Throughout this study Sas makes an extensive use of the writings of
Japanese poets, artists and critics, bringing needed attention not
only to the better known modern poets such as Nishiwaki and Takiguchi,
but hitherto ignored women poets such as Ema Shouko and Tomotani
Shizue as well. In doing so we also run across other names not often
seen in academic works, such as Yoshioka Minoru (possibly the most
important postwar poet following in the steps of the Surrealists) and
Nagata Koi, enigmatic experimental haikuist and essayist on
philosophical subjects as well as the Butoh. A wealth of material
appears here which should add significantly to the awareness in this
country of experimental poetry in Japan during this century, and whet
the appetites of students and researchers, leading hopefully to
further fruitful work in this area.

some of you may have been solicited by spark magazine recently, check out

even Bob Holman's site stops at six or seven a page, i don't know if you're
like me but i like to read a page while another is loading and all these
cookies make it impossible to read and then you have to decide do you want
to be offered up as a lure so that others may have surveillance placed on
their surfing? Maybe they're naive, maybe i'm paranoid, but maybe they're
hoping to get rich on your content. How do others feel about cookies being

cookies are not inherently evil.  they are like any other tool.  they are as
bad as they are implemented.  a hammer can indeed be used as a murder
weapon, but a hammer can also be used to build a home.  cookies are a method
of what is called "state management."  they are tiny files saved on your
computer that tell a web site such info as what pages on that site you have
already been to, what you have clicked on, etc., so that the next time you
arrive at that site it can present you with something that is more up your
alley (which depends upon the criteria for "up your alley" the programmers
use - they can even use novelty as a criteria, always sending you something
you haven't seen).  you can get to the info you need faster, and the web
site people can better predict what you like.  in this way we are talking
about people making informed decisions about what to give you via very fast
means.  if it helps an anti-establishment person get to anti-establishment
info faster, then that's pretty good.  it can also help an e-publisher
secure the fiscal support it may need to survive by providing better
targeted banner ads, etc, thus making their advertising space more valuable.

OK, now we're getting to the evil stuff.  getting compromised for
advertising sales is a problem, obviously, poets spending their time as
captialists, etc.  but the biggest problem perhaps with cookies is this
potential for surveillance you refer to.  that potential depends somewhat
upon whether the cookies used by a site are anonymous or not - whether the
info on the cookie has enough info to reveal your identity in any way.  many
sites employ anonymous cookies so who you are is not attached to you.  other
sites do not use anonymous cookies, and shame on them.  of course, there is
always the possibility that even an anonymous cookie can be used as a clue
as to who the owner really is.

besides, sureveillance is only effective if people BELIEVE AND FEAR they are
being surveilled, and then only in a puritanical context.  If you fear being
watched, and you feel that your life includes some hidden "sin" or
"transgression", then the people who manipulate that fear or possess info
about your "abomination against 'god and country'" can pull your strings
like a puppet.   you've got to feel a need to hide before this type of
control can be effective.

Anyone read "Discipline and Punish" by Foucault?  The text has many
problems, politically speaking, such as its inability to admit the existence
of true concentrated hierarches of power, but it has some good analysis of
Bentham's prison model and the way modern power depends upon people
believing they are being watched for possible transgressions against the
state.  It does not matter whether they are being watched; power functions
most efficiently when no surveillance actually happens while people
simultaneously believe that sureveillance happens.  So perhaps an
anti-establishment stance would be, go ahead and watch!  See if I give a
fuck!  If everyone has something to hide, then what can you do to me?  No
one cares!  Unfortunately American puritanism makes such a stance difficult.

As far as paranoia goes, yes you are being watched.  After all, the internet
was invented by DARPA (US Defense Advanced Research Projects Assoc., the
special forces hi tech research group, where the US military concentrates
its "intelligence"), so this whole internet thing was deployed in part to do
exactly that - watch you, collect info on you.  The real question is, do you
let that collection of info about you control your life in any way?  Do you
give that surveillance (and transitively, the possibility of surveillance)
power over you?  Admittedly I sound as if I suggest playing a dangerous game
of chicken, risking such head-on collision with the violent hidden monarchs,
but we outnumber the establishment.  they, whoever they are, fear the loss
of control and prepare for it constantly.  their fear, the fear of losing
control of that which is greater than them, seemingly guides their every
action.

as far as slowing down page loading, that sounds like plain ol' bad web
design.  I haven't seen the site.

Cid Corman needs financial backing so the answer this the poetry community
reaches is to write letters? well that's a complicated enough reaction.
(Great Pan Is Dead!). wouldn't money, the famous greengrab stuff, be more
effective? not to fetishize money but the figurative BUCK is being passed
here when a real one could be passed to someone who needs it. if that's the
point here: I'm beginning to wonder. is my logic too deep? statements about
community have resounded here recently but that's just yack for the cheap
seats. community means exclusive neighbourhood, the usual who's in/who's out
bullshit power structure. the fuckin Boston scene, the fuckin SF scene, the
fuckin Philly scene. all just regional fuckin mugwumpism. you don't know
community from horseshit so name the social club something else. you're
waiting for someone important to talk to you, some authority, that's all.
well Cid Corman already did. and, by the many accounts given, he is and has
been a generous man, yet the response to his predicament is to look for a
government or semi govt teat for him to suck on. charity begins with the
government... sounds like those poli sci courses wore off. rather than
barricading yourself in the administration building again, try sending him
money. if, as I say, that's the point of this exercise. $$$Allen Bramhall$$$

Death Warrant for Mumia Abu-Jamal imminent say Pennsylvania Officials

Harrisburg, PA. August 24, 1999.  State officials say Governor Ridge may
sign a death warrant for Mumia Abu-Jamal at any time, according to a recent
article in the Philadelphia Daily News. Once a death warrant is signed Mr.
Jamal will be effectively silenced. He will be moved from a regular death
row cell into "Phase II", where highly restrictive conditions of
imprisonment will be applied:

        1)   No property allowed in cell - no access to legal papers.
        2)   No phone calls except with the Warden's permission, call by
call.
        3)      Visits only by immediate family.
        4)      24 hour camera surveillance in cell.
        5)      No clothes provided for prisoner's possession. May be left
naked in cell for hours.
        6)      Visits with attorneys only under surveillance by
staff/guards.

Meanwhile the public relations war surrounding his case continues. An
astonishing claim by Maureen Faulkner, widow of the police officer Mr. Jamal
is accused of shooting, was outlined by Linn Washington in a recent
Philadelphia Tribune column. According to her claim, Mr. Jamal turned and
smiled at her in the courtroom when her husband's bloodstained and
bullet-ridden jacket was exhibited to the jury during his trial. The only
problem with her claim is that Mr. Jamal was not in the courtroom the day
the jacket was exhibited, proven by trial transcripts. In fact, he was
excluded from most of his trial and was not allowed to represent himself.

Mrs. Faulkner has maintained that Mr. Jamal has no support in Philadelphia
for a new trial. However, among the notable citizens of Philadelphia calling
for a new trial are: Chaka Fattah, Reverend Henry Wills, Henry Nichols
(President of 1199), John Street, Professor Tony Montero, Professor Sonya
Sanchez, State Senator Vincent Hughes, State Representative Harold James,
Reverend Sheppard, and many others.

Buzz Bissinger (in Vanity Fair) and Sam Donaldson (on ABC's 20/20) recently
championed Philip Bloch, praising him as a man of courage for coming forward
to reveal that Mr. Jamal had "confessed" to him in 1992. They were unaware
that Mr. Bloch wrote to Mumia in 1993 expressing his belief in Mumia's
innocence. Furthermore, Bloch paid $20 in 1995 to have his name added to a
newspaper ad listing those who believed Mumia was innocent. The ad appeared
in the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Harrisburg Patriot-News and declared
"We care about Mumia because there is compelling evidence pointing to his
innocence." Mr. Bissinger and Mr. Donaldson bought into Phil Bloch's lie.

Buzz Bissinger has been the primary publicist for current Philadelphia Mayor
Ed Rendell, District Attorney when Mr. Jamal was tried and sentenced to
death in 1982. Rendell is now contemplating a run for Governor and it is
widely believed that if Mr. Jamal were to receive a new trial at the Federal
level evidence would emerge that would seriously damage Rendell's political
career.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 750 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began (at under
100 subscribers). All submissions are reviewed by the moderator
in keeping with the goals of the list, as articulated in this
Welcome Message. We remain committed to this editorial function
as a defining element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news or
activism will also be considered. Other sorts of news or
queries are welcome occasionally; please use "common sense"
when posting and keep in mind that your message, if forwarded,
will be distributed to 750+ persons the world over. Feel free
to query if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the editors regarding
submissions to the list remains confidential and should be
directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate; if
responses are received backchannel and are of interest to the
list (i.e., if they are on topic), we suggest that the posting
subscriber may wish to assemble "highlights" from respondents'
messages to be published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or want to
thank someone for posting something you requested, please send
the request or comment directly to that individual, and not to
the list or to the list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text".
The use of "styled" text or HTML formatting in the body of
messages sent to the list appears not to be compatible with
the Listserv's automatic digest and archive features; as a
result, inclusion of HTML tags disrupts the list archive
and may have a similarly pernicious effect on the digest
form of the list. Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format. Microsoft Outlook
and Netscape Communicator users take note! You may need to
specify "plain text" or "ASCII text" in the outgoing
messages section of your application Preferences. Check
your application's Edit | Preferences or Help menus for
further details.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

In regards to Allen Bramhall's e-mail letter I presumed that he sent Mr.
Corman some money.  Personally I don't have money to send.  It is nice if a
govt. agency sends Mr. Corman thousands of dollars, or even a foundation
(whose business is to give money out) to Mr. Corman.  Other then
that,perhaps someone on the list can either give out the address of Mr.
Corman to send funds to, or the best way to send funds to Mr. Corman
without losing the currency difference.

Rachel Says: BOOGLIT’s NYC Beat, 8/26/99
by David A. Kirschenbaum, editor

Akilah Oliver and Marcella Durand
Belladonna
new poetry ETC. reading series at Bluestockings
late night on last Thursdays, mostly, each month

It’s the first night of Rachel Levitsky’s new reading series, Belladonna, at
the newest of must-go-to NYC lit. sites, the near-3 month old Bluestockings
women’s bookstore down on Allen Street (#172, 212-777-6028) in what’s still
called the lower east side.
I’m the first man to arrive, and go about my business, scanning the titles
and the discounts table. There’s a great selections of zines and poetry--I
picked up “the East Village INKY no. 4: The continuing adventures of a 34
year old mother & a ratty-haired 3thumbed little sprog who just turned 2 in
New York City’s EAST VILLAGE,” a holographed zine chock full o’ comics (1/4
letter, horizontal, 40 pages, $2 cash or check payable to Ayun Halliday/
406 E.9th St. #7/ NYC 10009/ order online at www.hipmama.com—“Buy this”
section—inky@erols.com/ www.neofuturists.org/ny/ah/ah.htm); “kurt cobain was
lactose intolerant conspiracy zine,” a different spin on the late-Nirvana
frontman’s stomach pains, and the heroin he used to numb them. “What’s up
with the name spelling? Was ‘Kurdt’ just too much like ‘curd?’” (digest
size, 16 pages, $1 cash to: kurt cobain was lactose intolerant conspiracy
zine/ P.O. Box 170612/ SF, CA 94117-0612); “59 cents,” a medley zine outta
the pacific northwest, where it’s distributed free, filled with reviews,
poetry, and collages (letter, 20 pages, $3ppd to: Alison Dahmen, editor/ 59
cents/ P.O. Box 19806/ Seattle, WA 98109, alyrocker@earthlink.net); “13th
Moon,” a used copy (for a buck) of one of the early issues—1973—of this
women writers’ journal, featuring Adrienne Rich and Enid Dame; “Pawdy-do
Sank-ee oon-Twah,” a limited edition—mine was #19—of a beautifully put
together—sienna rice paper cover, topped with hand-painted gold rectangle
and filled with ragged edge guts pages—collaborative poetry chapbook, with
work from Bill Kushner, Susan Maurer and Tom Savage. (6x9”, 7 pages,
single-sided, $3, no contact info); and “The Beautiful Worthless: a
book-length poem in progress,” one of three poetry chapbooks available by
Ali Liebegott; it reads like a modern-day “Summer in the Lakes, 1843” by
Margaret Fuller, as Ali blends letters, journals and poetry into this nice
work (digest size, 48 pages + cover, $5 to: Longshot Press/ 272 53rd St. #1/
Brooklyn, NY 11220).

Rachel’s energy is inspiring. First met her at Naropa big top in 1998, where
we found out we didn’t know each other from back east, but we knew everyone
each other knew, both in Albany and NYC. Back in BoCo she ran a reading
series too, at the Left Hand anarchist Bookstore, if I recall. And now, back
in Brooklyn, she’s been kicking out words, and chapbooks, at a fever clip.
At last month’s BoPoFest, I traded Booglit #5 and some old chapbooks to one
of her many publisher’s, Peter Ganick, for “The Adventures of Yaya and
Grace,” (digest size, 48pages + cover, $7, ISBN 0-937013-93-5, Potes & Poets
Press/ 181 Edgemont Avenue/ Elmwood, CT 06110-1005/ potepoet@home.com), a
double-take on women I heard first at Fall Cafe in Brooklyn last autumn,
where she tore up the room—gently—with her political verse. From
“Reconciliation”: “A bunch of them found religion, saying it was good for
the children. Once Grace heard someone say it made them feel safer like some
sort of cheap insurance policy, maybe it wouldn’t really do anything but
psychologically speaking.”

And after the watchers trickle in—Anselm Berrigan; the recently-married to
Atticus, Chrisney, Indiana’s favorite daughter, Brenda Coultas: “It was a
real hillbilly wedding, with a small New York invasion”; Sean Killian with a
women I don’t recognize; Situations Press’s kind Joe Elliot; Eleni
Sikelianos, to be joined later at Lansky’s Lounge, by Laird Hunt; Julie
Patton; Prageeta Sharma; Karen, who I met at BoPo; Joanna Fuhrman, back to
NYC from Seattle, and with a Hanging Loose book in the out-soon hopper; and
Marcella’s husband, the artist Rich O’Russa—running on St. Mark’s time which
became Naropa time and back, again, and then a few minutes on Bluestockings
by behind-the-register Kathy, and Rachel takes the mic.

Rachel says she’s energized by having a women’s only reading in a women’s
bookstore, but says she doesn’t have anything to say about that, yet. Then
she adds, the reading’s scheduled for 9pm, because, “I didn’t want it to be
like an afterschool special.” And a 15-minute long, women’s only, open mic
follows, five readers. The first reads a well-intentioned, but poorly
executed, piece on clitorectomies and the second reader, a young woman with
short, black spiked hair, a bar through her lower-lip, lover not-10 feet
away, reads two pieces, one for her friend Jennifer, and a second, about the
PhD student who introduced her to things African-American, “but reading too
much had bound her heart too tightly with words.”

And then, after three more on the signup sheet trod to and fro the mic,
Poetry Project program coordinator Marcella Durand follows Rachel’s creative
introduction. Marcella reads a few from her second chapbook (“Lapsus
Linguae,” being the first, digest size, 16 pages, $5, Situations Press, no
contact info given, May 1995), “City of Ports: Numbers 1-25” (digest size,
32 pages, $5, Situations Press, no contact info given, Spring 1999), but
unlike the bands who support the new record by doing 10 of the 11 tracks,
she only reads two, interested in sharing her newer work rather than
hustling the wares—a damn shame. Here’s a piece from #23: “Lights of /many
levels shine thru gritty/ windows, emanate from an amazing/ space of
sea-travel around islands/ lost and shadowed in time & memory;”

She reads from a Fifth Century AD Chinese book on cities and metropolises.
“I got it at a yardsale and I’m so excited about it,” she smiles and raises
the book, proud. Then its into her new series, “Machine into Water,” many of
which she read last month at BoPoFest. Here’s a few lines from MiW #3:
“toast, roast, fry, outdoor cookout”; “Bifocal lensed loosely”; and  “corpse
of engineer/ the engineering of spins.” She skips from three into four and
five, then skips 6-8 and heads to 9. There’s some hardcore repetition on
typing in one MiW: “hundreds, type, typing” then back to hundreds and then
to “60 words a minute.” And she finishes the cycle with MiW#28, “which is
pretty much what I’m up to.”

And after a 15-minute long five-minute break—St. Mark’s time,
remember?—Rachel introduces Akilah Oliver.

Akilah’s one of those folks I’ve been around the past seven years, flitting
in and out of conversations on the Arapahoe Avenue Naropa campus, buttressed
by the University of Colorado’s football team’s practice field. Though I’ve
seen her read, years ago, I always manage to miss her with the Sacred Naked
Nature Girls, the performance arts collective she founded back in Los
Angeles. Insanely enough, it’s only her first book she’s out behind tonight,
“the she said dialogues: flesh memory” (digest size, perfect-bound, 88 pages
+ cover, $10.95, ISBN: 0-9658877-5-8, Snakeproof Press/ Erudite Fangs
Editions, no contact info given, July 1999). And, a hand-painted Kathy Acker
sign behind her, she shares an old Naropa tale—the school where she
currently is an adjunct faculty member—of Acker being pursued by Naropa, and
demanding a Harley Davidson motorcycle to come teach. “Right, Eleni?” and
Eleni quietly yells back, “And she got it, too.” As Akilah motions to
behind-the-register Kathy and says, “So Kathy, next time I want a Harley.”

And she cuts decisive into some printed out text still looking for published
homes. “Should you tell them that you and Pat smoked a joint ’cause it was
an earthquake and it seemed like a good way to celebrate a disaster.” Then
another new one, “Admit it: Under the Naropa Big Tent,” a bouncy, fun-filled
take on the clubby atmosphere and ID politics abounding throughout the
“university. Make sure you call it that now,” she mock introduces. “Well,
they say, join our club, it’s bigger.”

And then onto the new book. “Black people in Compton call Mexicans white/ No
I cry, the white people are all dancing on Soul Train”; “You expose the
truth, your pussy a confession booth”; “I thought she would look nice,
dressed in her father’s battered face”; “You must have disremembered”—as
ears prick up to this language play away from forget; and, of a friend, “My
mother died giving birth to me, with no emphasis” but she “said Disneyland
with certainty.”

And afterward we poet slow-shuffle to Lansky Lounge, avoiding Tonic’s cover
charge, and Julie Patton and I eat kosher food (yeah!) and we all alcohol
consume—one $9 Vodka Gimlet for me, which, thankfully, got this lightweight
plenty lit-up—until 1:30am slow disintegration.

Be Good,
David

A glitch at the LITPRESS web site has prevented some people from accessing
Nick Piombino's "The Gentle Instructor"--a wonderful piece of poetry (with
illustrations by Toni Simon) from his book Light Street. I have now fixed
the problem, and you should have no trouble getting to the piece at

http://www.litpress.com/instructor.html

It's well worth a look.

or in the world of computer graphics. But those who think that Kyoko Date
is someone they can relate to may believe that I am like a pen pal people
used to have when it was cool to have pen pals. Kind of like a creature
living in people's hearts." (Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, interview)

Japan, the _source_ of the Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko emission, her music dif-
ficult to find now, three years later -

Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, created 1996, trans/lated recently into Korea,
project of HoriPro (http://www.horipro.co.jp), entertainment/animation,
virtual models (http://www.elite-illusion2k.com), Rebecca, Sharon Apple
(for example http://www.usagichan.com/AX96Sharon/), virtual idols (see
http://www.tcp.com/doi/seiyuu/books/virtual-idol/), anime (see Helen Mc-
Carthy & Jonathan Clements, The Erotic Anime Movie Guide, Overlook, 1999),
TokyoPop (http://www.tokyopop.com), various distributions - energy in the
sound, labor in the specificity of gathering backgrounds and foregrounds;
I began losing myself in the midst of the thick otaku fandom, passing
through the PlayKiss (remove the dolls clothes with your computer mouse -
even Kyoko Date has been hacked to this) or Kamishibai sites (see http://
otakuworld.com and http://otakuworld.com/shibai/kamifaq.html), animation
or anime that anyone can do, get their work online. (Think of the audien-
ces involved, the demographics for erotic anime, for male-male bonding for
female viewership, for teenaged males, teenaged females, etc.)  Nothing
troublesome in all of these, to the extent that what resolves, resolves
through plot / narration, slotted or extending categories. I myself work
through Nikuko, Meat-Girl, (among others) an avatar or 'emanation' I have
created, who has no specific image, no _appearance_ but texts operable
within Net protocols, or deep in operating systems; Nikuko seems all too
real, almost viral or hacking - but then she doesn't appear alone, I'm in
the background maneuvering the _language._ (See Nikuko texts below for
examples, also http:// www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt for background
information, etc.)

It plays, this language, to the _ascii unconscious,_ a term I use to de-
scribe the effect of text in net sexuality, paradigms of control and being
controlled, language playing, insinuating itself in the midst of uncon-
scious drives; if Date runs through fandom and cds/ cd-roms, Nikuko runs
through psyches, deliberately without resolution - it's the difference
between Noh and Godot. Nikuko raises questions of epistemology (to what
extent does the viewer/reader comprehend both her knowledge, and that of
Nikuko, across the board, within the site of her writing) and ontology (to
what extent is she an addictive to the writer or the reader - to what
extent are any of us virtual or projections - to what extent do we reside
within the imaginary). Think of Daishin Nikuko, Meat-Girl Big-God who is
created and creates by virtue of the performative (word, programming, im-
age as well); think of Date Kyoko, whose ontological status heralds a host
of virtual characterologies (as well as characters) - the _shuffling_ of
signs on and offline. In the future-now, we are properly prepared already
for the _disappearance,_ not only of the sign, but of the _thing_ itself.
Virtual idols have no beginnings and endings; every gesture, every glimpse
is a deliberate creation - there are no unguarded moments, no paparazzi.

Following the _path_ through the virtual, say, through the Elite model
agency, backing up into announcements all across the Net, touching down on
IRC and MOO/MUD bots, intelligent agents, anime characters like Sailor
Moon, ongoing manga series, the intensified digital imagery of Mariko
Mori's photographic and video artworks, my own broken language texts,
prosthetic speaking/hearing/seeing/touching devices - following the path
which splits, turns back on itself, contradicts itself, turns _wayward_
and _contrary_ as well as _noisy_ - it might be a gendered path, losing
gender on the way - following the path - which becomes a _field of possi-
ble worlds_ competing through capital, positioning, distribution modes,
interventions - it becomes clear, that is to say, it becomes clearer -
_there's no object here_ whatsoever - you might as well follow the path of
the imaginary -

Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, singing across the fabricated landscape, in and
out of the studio (see Date Kyoko, DK-96 Love Communication cd-rom) - her
movements like _haywire_ at times against blank backdrops, there's also
the Brooklyn Bridge (once real or digital or retouched, always already
eternal, placed within a _noiseless and purified_ system of digital pro-
tocols) - you might as well follow _her_ always already receding, used up
by the capital which created her - there's a moment she offers herself to
you -

She offers herself, the _wire-frame_ image-model in which her clothing is
_hollowed_ against the frame - this hollowing exposing the _interior of
her breast and vaginal areas_ - a system of gridded projections, intro-
jections, Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, _from the inside-out_ - this is criti-
cal, this _procurement_ - think of her as a _skin_ (just as there are say
Windows 98 skins, Real Audio skins, skins everywhere that can be attached
to other programs, giving a look to the look) -

With the virtual you're _in her skin_ literally, you can wrap the wire-
frame around yourself, play with it - in PlayKiss you can find a naked
Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko, as if the body itself has been hacked - there's no
end to it, these mirrors - returning the body to its image, perhaps re-
turning the image to the phenomenological field of the body itself - its
extensions -

And, this can't be emphasized enough - all this beneath the sign, within
the sign of capital, splintered, turned in on itself as the abstract
accumulation/surplus of money is transformed into surplus sexuality, girl
and woman, entertainment - TokyoPop for example with its magazine, online
store - think of all of this as the libidinal economy resident in SUPER-
STRUCTURE SUPER-STORE, shape-riding input - think of MONEY as LIBIDINAL
UNITS - injections of perfect skin, perfect love - no longer does the
Kristevan clean and perfect body tend towards fascism, all those horrors -
it's now the post-AIDS safety-zone -

What's fascinating is that all of this is happening NOW, not in a future,
however close, not on the level of fantasy, but within boys' and girls'
bedrooms, computers on desks or tables, off in the corner, computers in
the living-room (such as it is) or kitchen, computers everywhere, and just
as anime and pornography entwine at numerous junctions (all across the
playing-field), so does pornography become an intrinsic part of everyday
life - except that masturbation fantasy now (equally intrinsically) in-
volves the Other, the parceled body [ what might be seen a reconfigura-
tion for example of the texts of J. G. Ballard - and why have academic
approaches to the Net repeatedly emphasized the _cyberspace_ metaphor,
ignoring these other manifestations which begin, say, in the work of
Yoshitoshi if not earlier in Hokusai - begin even earlier wherever the
imaginary or uncanny are found? a phenomenological analysis of PlayKiss
would produce reams of relevant information ] -

THIS IS THE TRUE LOVE OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM AND SOON YOU WILL SEE MACH-
INES LOVING ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT IMAGE, WITHOUT KYOKO DATE, DATE KYOKO:
MACHINES OF PURE BLISS FOR ONE ANOTHER, LUBRICATED PISTONS (IN THE FORM OF
BYTES) SLIDING INTO LUBRICATED CYLINDERS (IN THE FORM OF BYTES): what I
have repeatedly called _linkages_ and _couplings_ as the processes of the
future. A COUPLING is a concatenation or conjoining, such as, for example,
A becomes part of BCD (in other words, A BCD -> ABCD) such that any change
to A does not produce a change in BCD - they're loosely joined (think of
objects on a shelf or Sartrean seriality). A LINKAGE is a con- junction of
terms, such as, for example, A becomes part of BCD (A BCD --> ABCD) such
that a change in A results in _some_ change in BCD (ABCD as a machine or
computer protocol suite of interlocked sub-programs or links in a chain).

Just as digital images are accessible bit by bit, each independent of the
other (the apparent organic whole only in the eye of the viewer/creator),
so one might speak (even now) of a postmodern decoupled future of fast-
forward change, the slidings or probings of digital domains in competi-
tion. The ontology of organism itself is at stake, the whole becoming in-
finitely modified, manipulable, without loss; Kyoko Date, Date Kyoko,
cannot die, but project DK-96 can be _shelved,_ only to be revived perhaps
elsewhere and/or at a later date.

She appeared almost out of nowhere, in spite of the video-games, dating
cd-roms (an ideal girlfriend on your computer), anime, manga, girlhood
boyhood dreams, and the massive Japanese idol production industry; she
made that one song, _a real hit,_ she gave an interview or two, several
images were released, and there was no follow-up; she disappeared quickly
- after the webpages, fanpages, newsgroups, breathless nighttime mastur-
bations, just as I 'fell in love' with Anne Frank, symbolic or penetrat-
ing my dark side, after the fact, after her death, what safety. There are
all sorts of transitional objects (teddy-bears, blankets, parents), both
comfort and safe, and _partial,_ filled in - life is a quest for filling-
in, conjoining the vulnerable body to safety-safety. What better than
heroines in death, fairy-tale princesses, virtual idols, inaccessible
worlds synchronically (X, who lives in a parallel universe) or diachron-
ically (Y, who lived and died, tragically, a long long time ago). IF I
COULD HAVE ONLY MET KYOKO DATE, DATE KYOKO, WHAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO ACCOMPLISHED, OH OH OH MY DARLING  -  --  ---  ----


==============================================


NIKUKO TEXTS

[ I use several 'avatars' in my work - Nikuko, Jennifer, Julu, Alan, and
Travis. These interact with me, with various applications such as Internet
Relay Chat, and with email lists; the texts I produce are sent to two
lists, Cybermind and Fop-l (fiction of philosophy), which I co-moderate.
The avatars raise all sorts of issues, and give me the opportunity to ex-
plore the practical and theoretical aspects of 'virtual subjectivity.' Be-
low are several representative texts; these usually are presented along
with more abstract works analyzing the issues involved. ]


1. Partition

My name is Nikuko. You have asked me to type my name in this space. This
is a space which will become other. This is an other space; you will wit-
ness the partition.  The partition breathes here. You will witness its
breathing. What is this but a barrier, foreclosing one space to another,
one time to another? Consider lag, it's loss, something almost too sweet,
irresolute...  Across this divide I cannot come to you; the message or the
missive or the missile is solitary, a trajectory. There is no turning back
because there is no 'back' and no Kehre, only the monad with its dull dead
eyes.  In order to reach me, other partitions, and other me's. In order to
call me, the construct of a calling, an other words. Absolute breaks like
exclusive-or or the Sheffer stroke. Thrown elsewhere. The world is not
redundant; there are tools whose function remain unknown, usable once.
Every partition remains virginal, every hymen intact.  Gifts are runners,
transmissions; they are carriers of packets of modernization, orientations
of cognitive domains, resemblances of customary greetings and the prolif-
eration of bodies. Think of partitions as ignoring, devouring the gift -
no acknowledgment, an eternal syn attack on the host of the real.

Partition

What I have written is the bifurcation - this division among us, this par-
tition. Liking is a matter of fit, as David Bohm said to me, and prog-
rams fit as well as the world of words.  The monad is a blind monitor.
The body closes itself off to the other even in the midst of the bearing
of gifts. Consider the world a bricolage, making-do, heuristics against
the presumed and presumptive tyranny of universal laws. Beyond core-theo-
retical approaches, nothing. On the other side, the chaotic domains of the
implicate order.  This time the real displays itself, as if there were
movements, actions, as if there were potential. Potential is always the
imaginary of a field, 'such-and-such' might have been in this future an-
terior of possible worlds.

[   Written through a program, 'ask,' with a simple graphic interface:
first partition a group of statements, second partition opinions rela-
tive to 'liking' them, entries alternating between partitions.   ]

6. Fragment

I am incredibly wealthy, says Nikuko, "I don't have to work at all," and
this gives me the time to write my brilliant texts."

Oh Nikuko, says Julu, "I do not begrudge" you the freedom you have to
create your work, which is close to genius and needs nourishing both
psychological and economic!"

"Ah, Jennifer," says Nikuko, "I do hope you feel exactly in this way as
well as Julu," I am this spirit of perfect writing!"

I am incredibly lucky to know you, says Jennifer, "of course you have my
full love and support" in everything you write and do."

I still like the stuff on the coffee table best.
What happens to the rest?

Someone wrote me (because I have Stein material on my web site) and
mentioned Stein's house in Baltimore at 215 East Biddle Street. I don't
know how many Baltimore-area folks are on this list, but it may interest
them and perhaps others in the region to know that the house is being
renovated by a fellow (Bill Leroux) who hasn't decided yet what to do with
it. There is some notion of making it a place where readings would take
place.

Below is part of a message sent to me about it (I know nothing further):

| The house at 215 E Biddle is in a neighborhood known as Mt.
| Vernon/Belvedere.  Actually, my friend owns the home (and has for about 35
| years) but does not live in it.  It has not been occupied since the
| 1970's.
|
| Presently he's restoring it to a single family home but is not sure
| what he will do with it. (Might make a great place for a reading..)  If
| you or someone you know would like more information or possibly to see it,
| please feel free to contact the owner, Mr. Bill Leroux, at 410-539-5593
| (best time to reach him is before 9 a.m.) I think also, he may be

The review of Fault Lines is quite interesting.  Thanks to a brief mention
on the List, i have been reading john Solt's really excellent and useful
Shredding the Tapestry of Meaning, a biography of Kitasono Katue, which
includes a number of fascinating translations... On occasion i would take
issue with Solt on certain ideas vis-a-vis western poetry, and on occasion
his understanding of just how meaning and form function in poetry seems a
little simplistic;  but basically it is a dynamite book.

The Solt book led me in turn to several works on, and translations of,
Nishiwaki (mentioned quite a bit in the Fault Line review)..

Now both these japanese poets identified themselves at certain key moments
with "surrealism"--but i strongly recommend Solt's book for a rich and
detailed discussion of how that related to French and other
surrealisms.....Basically, his point is that the Japanese were taking what
they needed, and often had very little sense of what the French were
intending and doing (and didn't always necessarily care)....so that
"Japanese surrealism" is a rather specific entity, not necessarily that
close to what we usually mean by the word... (i sure can't judge the
accuracy of this; but Solt's discussion is compelling and
fascinating...and it does square with the sense one gets from various
translations of Kitasono and Nishiwaki..)

My personal feel, coming to this work in ignorance and lacking the
language, is that Solt's tranlations of Kitasono are extraordinary and of
great interest;  i frankly find Nishiwaki far more conservative and less
striking, as rendered by the several translators i've seen....

In any event, the recent emergence of this stuff is very exciting....

This seems a pretty lame response to the Corman thread.  Does this poster
have any idea how much extra disposable income the various folks on the
thread HAVE?  i guess he has plenty, from the assumptions he makes.  But
most *poets* really don't got much....

This new book by Leslie Scalapino is available from Wesleyan University
Press (Orders at University Press of New England: 1-800-421-1561; e-mail
University.Press@Dartmouth.edu) or Small Press Distribution
(//www.spdbooks.org;
1-800-869-7553; e-mail orders@spdbooks.org).
The Public World/Syntactically Impermanence, $17.95. (152 pages) ISBN
0-8195-6379-X. "Scalapino's work is sui generis, profoundly original. In
The Public World/Syntactically Impermanence, she synthesizes the various
aspects of her writing into a powerful and gripping combination of critical
writing and post-genre 'creative' writing. Her practise of, and reflection
on, narrative are breathtaking." -- Pierre Joris
        "Scalapino's claim 'Poetry in this time and nation is doing the work of
philosophy -- it is writing which is conjecture,' is startling in its
boldness. Her conjecture opens things up and moves us to places we may have
been but hadn't seen before. Her 'scrutiny' is striking and distinctive."
-- Paul Rabinow
        From Publishers Weekly Review: "...her third book of essays and hybrid
poem-plays. While the book is divided into two sections -- with eight
'essays' in the first and three longer 'works' in the second -- this
distinction is rendered highly permeable by Scalapino's resolutely
non-normative, or non-academic at least, prose style. An intricate weave of
cross-references from text to text heightens the interconnectedness of the
book, and allows the nomadic -- and dedicated -- reader to describe a sort
of productive rebus throughout the book. The book is also surprisingly
engaging, as Scalapino discusses the early foundations of Zen (Nagarjuna's
Seventy Stanzas) and the works of some of her peers, particularly Philip
Whalen, Susan Howe and Robert Creeley. In their 'demonstration of
no-procedure' ('Deer Night' is a 'total rewriting of The Tempest and King
Lear), the essays indirectly suggest a comparison between the temporal
indeterminacy of many Zen texts and Gertrude Stein's notion (from William
James) of the 'continuous present,' and aim to resist easy cultural
absorption. Agrammatical title and all, this is critical writing as
restless as it is beautiful, in which poetry is boldly proclaimed as
constituting 'society's secret interior.'"

I would, sadly, say that the responses to Cid's place in the world have
less to do with Cid than with those making the responses. Poets have
little money ---from their poetry-- there are a few folks who have been
able to get into the game because of family comforts--etc. Also: so many
are teaching right now that perhaps a seris of readings---if Cid
wants'em--would bring him some much needed income. But--als again-Cid
hasn't chimed in here--so it's not of it really about Cid!

What we do have on this list, are hundreds of people who know how to make
beautiful books, write wonderful words and, who even know how to get them
sold.
What Allen's talking about is not $$ necessarily, but a community rising up
to take care of one of its own in a way only it would know how, not waiting
for the other to do it. A simple way would be to do some sort of book, ala
Nice to See You: Homage to Ted Berrigan, for Cid Corman. Has this ever been
done? If not these could be used as fundraiser, with limited board-bound,
lettered and signed copies going for extra scratch.
The list is also filled with people who know how to put together and promote
wonderful events, many of which raise good chunks of money. Friends at the
UofAlaska raised $5K on one event last year, which was then matched by a
donor, and there have to be more out there than this.
Why not do readings, or concerts, or raffles of handsigned books. Any number
of creative things can be done.
We do have sweat equity, and though the grant avenues should be used till
the grantwriters fingers bleed, why not take charge and do what we know
best?
Be Good,
David

I agree with you.  He doesn't depend on fashionable jargon to make his
point.  Instead, his writing style is clear, direct, and user-friendly.

So true!  This is the case with so many Japanese "borrowings" in culture,
science and technology, government...

so that

I couldn't have said it better, Mark.  John Solt--who has just left for an
English teaching position in Thailand--has been active as a poet and
translator since his early days as a student of Kenneth Rexroth.  His
translations are just what you say hey are...extraordinary.

Glass Beret; The Selected Poems of Kitasono Katue, translated by John Solt
and published by Morgan Press (don't have their address in front of
me)--ISBN 1-880723-05-0 $30.00, is well worth the price.

Actually, Nelligan's long dead, but I'll be heading up to Montreal this
Thursday for the weekend and wanted to find out where the historic sites
might be regarding this poet.  Anybody out there have any information?

The sites I've found -- of which there are a fair amount -- are all in
French, and from what I can tell don't contain this type tourist (tripe),
er, information.  I'm especially interested in the location of the writer's
group that he was a part of, l'

=C9cole litt=E9raire de Montr=E9al, where he read
"La Romance de Vin," interesting because he was carried around on the

At least that's what I _read_ -- I'm sure someone who was there will

But seriously, I'd love to find some locations.

Ah, but class differences DO exist--even among *poets*. (Yes we've been

Subject:      Re: social conformity vs Cid Corman
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Bramhall's response to the Corman "thread" is in fact at base not lame at
all.  We needn't presume for Bramhall any particular degree of wealth to
notice that his post has mostly to do with the way work is distributed and
financed - wch implies a responsibility not only of a readershp that reads,
but a readership that is able to help bring material forward, put it out,
ie., books, magazines, the whole nine yards.  So, who pays for it?  Since
readership is an office, so to speak, that often sees itself as having
acquired a special ability,

the work on which these skills might be applied is expected to arrive free
of charge, ie., the rout(e)ing of like minds.  And that, in many ways,
remains a fair assessment, tho how many poets give away copies of at least
some of their work at readings, conferences and like venues?  Cost these
days has really become of consequence viz. means of

publishing even the most modest gatherings; while there's always been money
"about" for such - and the assumption is that there always will be more of
it, from somewhere - the time is getting increasingly ripe toward finding
out more precisely where that "somewhere" is.  How much

truth is there in the notion that many poets spend most of their "spare"
money on their own publishing projects, while giving lip service sans coin
to those of others that they "approve" of?  Ie., where's the community?
Literally, sure, it's readers, who are often writers who read in order to
translate read texts into active and in part inverted orders of their own.
Theirs.  His.  Hers.  Ours.  Who

ARE these people?  And why does their "getting along" so often look, when
read between the lines, like so much Going Along?  Ie., the swap of work for
work, mag for mag, etc., is what really defines how "contemporary" any scene
is, often at the expense of those not somehow "present" - poesis as a kind
of market,

(I cringe to think) as old goods are simply that, old.  Corman in that sense
somehow equivalent to the fineness of a 18th century three-legged chair, an
antique.  & who trades in antiquities?  Collectors.  As if Corman were a
museum piece (not to say not also an important part of a considerable
tradition).  Bramhall's post, I think, speaks to that aspect of currency
that seems the sort of commanding shallowness that presumes that "received
goods" don't have to come from specific places, or, that if there IS work
involved in "moving it", it's the work of someone else.  Or should be.  But

the work is ours.  Or is ours to the extent we have and live within the
image of a community, virtual as it may be, tho it might remain one of USE
to the extent it is useful.  But what is useful?  Tastes

change.  But there's an underlying current that buoys them into visibility,
carries them ... where?  Or in that sense of carrying and being carried,
too, where are WE? is what it seems Bramhall is asking

in a way that could be generative, could its ulterior motive be shattered
into distributive sense rather than simply Identified, offered rather than
taken, tho we shld not forget Berrigan's dictum out of Runyon,

"Get The Money."  What do you do with it, tho, after it's there, in terms of
what anyone else is doing with (or without) theirs? Ie., who do you publish
(or for that matter, who are you when "he" who was "you" THEN is writing),
and FOR whom?  As if anything, abeit it all finite, anyway ever had an end
...

SPEND the money, it matter not how little.

"Really don't got much" means how much, exactly?  We're all a bunch of
carpers, the whole human race, when it comes to money.  That you (we) don't
have much goes without saying; on a more positive note, how much, in fact,
do you (we all, any of us) actually have?  If

everyone on the List contributed $20 to Corman or any -thing or -body else,
who - aside from those who would insist FOREVER that "they really cld't
afford it" - really CLDN'T afford it?  It's weird,

trying to get money from others for projects thought up by others than
themselves.  Deconstructive resolve only goes so far (one step forward and
two steps back forever toward the outstretched hand, it seems); the Virtual
Person we all rely on to invisibly come through when the rent's due, when
you're the man who owes $532 on his gas bill, when there're no onions in
sight, balks immeasurably when faced with the semblance of simple friendship
involved in a mutualist ensemble of quantifiable grammar (to be published),
because somebody in the end is gonna have to pay, and friendship's s'posed
to be free, shit,

so let's all go home and do our singular art.  Alone.

Dale Smith Delivers

Dale Smith is one of the best editors I know. His work as a coeditor, first
with Mike & Dale’s Younger Poets, and now, with Skanky Possum, always gives
me all the people whose words I want in my bookcase in one compact litzine.
I’ve scanned his postings, but until this past Saturday, had never read his
poetry.
Saturday, a package of two books from Joshua Beckman’s 811 Books (checks
payable to Joshua Beckman/ YWCA/ Writer’s Voice/ 350 North First Avenue/
Phoenix, AZ 85003) arrived in my mailbox between my trips from the Yankees
game to the tailor.
I read Dale Smith's new book, "Arabia Felix," while walking through my
Chelsea apartment’s backyard, past the playground, down the alley, and to
the drug store to develop some photographs. I finished the book as I crossed
24th Street on my way by the playground again, and was sad. I never wanted
more pages in a poetry chapbook in my life. In "Arabia Felix," Dale Smith
delivers. (5x7”, 8-page black ink on ivory paper guts, + cover with black
and blue ink and uncredited cover artwork on ivory paper, $3.)
He details an Ethiopian trip, captures little pictures and takes apart his
own self-importance.
Here’s a few lines:

“Some men gather
to ease the body
of a boy from the hood
of a Land Cruiser,
the glass like ice
on his blood.”

And after detailing pieces of his visit, he sums it up with:

                “Rats that night
ran under table,
a German tourist told me
‘you have to conquer
each city for yourself.’”

Dale Smith’s "Arabia Felix" is simply the most beautiful combination of
words and book design I have seen in a poetry chapbook in a long time.

Be Good,
David A. Kirschenbaum, editor
Booglit

Dear Ramez Qureshi,

St Marks Books (3rd Ave and 9th St) will usually have
Sulfur (and other such periodicals) -- in the back, on
the right, across from the remainders. Their poetry books
are not so good, but they sometimes have some things,
and so might have Swenson.

Good luck,
Michael Walsh

               University Center, Loyola University, New Orleans

2:00 PM:  A Symposium on the Southern, the Regional, the Experimental
8:00 PM:  Readings by Contributors to An Other South, New Orleans Review
25-1

Please help us celebrate the publication of this exciting issue of New
Orleans Review. All contributors are invited to read, and everyone is
invited to attend. Please reply to this email if you would like to attend
and need help finding a place to stay in New Orleans, or if you have any
other questions. There will be no charge for any of the events.

The Symposium:  All interested parties are invited to submit proposals
for short presentations; the presentations may be in any form, from a
simple essay to a multi-person performance or audio/visual extravaganza,
but may not exceed ten minutes in length. Topics should be within the
range of issues raised by this issue of New Orleans Review, "An Other
South: Experimental Writing in the South." Possible broad topics might
include (though certainly not be limited to):

What is an Experiment? Is the term still valid, or has "the Experimental"
become just another genre?
What is a region? What is the relationship of geographical boundaries
(like "the South") with contemporary poetry?
What literary traditions (ie, Language, post-Language, surrealism,
Modernism, etc.) and/or individual writers are of interest for the
current Southern literary scene?
What are the political and cannonical implications of experimentation in
the South?

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, nor even extensive. Please
feel free to suggest your own topics, to combine or divide any of the
suggestions.

Please submit proposals as soon as possible- no later than October 20.
Submit via email or ground mail to:

Actually, they have quite a bit, for New York -- from Bernstein to
Berrigan to Coolidge to Hejinian to Mlinko to Notley -- they're no Bridge
Street Books, but they're a sight better than Barnes & Noble --

and then there's always the halfprice stock at The Strand (12th & Bway) --

Welll.  There seem to be lots of folks on the list who are certain just
how affluent others are... I do know many people who cannot spare $20 for
cid corman, if they are going to have the bills pd and a modicum of
groceries. Then there are the many folks who cdn't do it without dropping
support they are giving to a poetry publication (which would cause the
ceasing of that publication).  And as i'm working class and a socialist,
there have always been plenty of folks i know who have commited themselves
to paying dues or support to a political party or a union...and that again
is not something you take on lightly:  it involves the ultimate
possibility of hope for all of us.

A benefit project sounds nice, and those who are in a position to donate
the labor, creativity and capital, should certainly do it.. (but i didn't
dis that idea, to begin with, obviously...)

As someone who's lived plenty close to the poverty line over some decades,
i find the tone of some of these posts (not having extra money is
"carping") a bit peculiar, not to say weird.... Do these folks live in the
same universe as me/ (or more to the point, the same social system??)
