DIAMOND IN THE RAIN






        The grand romance of Canadian history was the improbable
laying of railroad track across the seemingly empty continent to the
little city at the end of things. For the portion of a person that is
still European, that outpost on the edge of a giant unimaginable
ocean was dark, scary exoticism, with a fascinating light in the
middle. Guillaume Apollinaire, the great Italian-Russian surrealist
poet who wrote in French, said it this way:
                =C9tincelant diamont
                Vancouver
                O=F9 le train blanc de neige et de feux nocturnes fuit l'hiver.
Of course the railroad has been succeeded by the highway and the
airlane, but the romance remains, as Canadians in the snow exaggerate
the mystery of the warm rainy city at the foot of snow-headed Pacific
mountains. Blaise Cendrars, the great Swiss poet, friend of
Apollinaire, and ceaseless traveller, wrote a poem called
"Vancouver," in which we hear: "ces halos bleu=E2tres dans le vent sont
les paquebots en partance pour le Klondyke le Japon et les grandes
Indes."
        The names of our province, our city and our streets are still
European, but on the edge of the world, as we must seem to be to
easterners, we do not live in history. We live in mythology. We are
consigned to nature. We do not like to eat indoors. We share the
madness of California but we import our oranges. And we are less
European all the time. More than a third of the people who live in
Vancouver are descended from Asia.
        When I walk across the street, I tread carefully, because I
do not desire to be hit by that silver BMW driven by a young Chinese
woman with a cell phone held to the side of her head. She is a
Vancouverite as I am. I am on my way to that sushi bar over there,
where I will manipulate ohashi, little sticks with clumps of salmon
roe between them. Yum!
        How can I convey our life on the rim? Toronto has more
novelists than we do, but we have more poets. Montreal has more
federal politicians than we do, but we have more mad people in the
streets. Ottawa has more doughnut shops than we do, but we have more
cups of organic tea. When we jump onto a plane, we fly to Thailand.
        Rivers flow quickly from our mountains into the sea, and the
salmon who came down those rivers four years ago have been to Japan
and back, and now they are going back up those rivers to give birth
and to die. The Native people said goodbye to them four years ago,
and now they are saying hello. They have been doing that since time
began here. When we Europeans and Asians came here the "Indians"
showed us how to prepare and eat the salmon.
        If we look down from our mountains we see blue halos in the
ocean, behind the long sea canoes of the Native people, who showed us
how to find the fur seals, so that the men and women of Europe could
wear flamboyant hats for three hundred years. By the time that Blaise
Cendrars found Vancouver the trains filled with Oriental silk were
departing eastward, filled too with armed guards, dangerous mystery
on steel wheels over snowy prairie.
        Really, we rest protected by an inland sea, surrounded by
hundreds of mountain-tops protruding from the ocean, our Pacific
islands covered with cedar and ferns. No wall here is as old as the
stone fence around an ancient convent in downtown Montreal. But from
our windows we see stones billions of years older than any human
ambition, and we feel the desire to stand among them. We can see
every year of human life around us-stains, wounds, expensive
show-homes scarring the high slopes of the mountains on the north
shore of our inlet.
        After the railroad tracks and the highways and the airlanes
came the Internet. In February the people of Vancouver like to e-mail
their friends huddled under piles of snow in Ontario and Manitoba,
and tell them about the flowers that are blossoming in their gardens
and along their streets. In return, people in Ontario and Manitoba
say very rude things to their friends in Vancouver.
        The scientists say that one day, not too far in the future,
there will be an enormous earthquake along the west coast of Canada,
and Vancouver's forest of highrise apartment buildings will collapse
into a tangled mountain of glass and steel. This is the dark dream
that enters the minds of Vancouver's citizens while they sleep. But
in the mornings they forget. They look into the rain clouds overhead
and imagine that they see a patch of blue sky. If that patch is
there, and if it begins to spread, and if the sun shines its light on
all the wet trees and bridges of the city, the wide awake people see
the most beautiful sight ever seen inside or outside a poem.

Pur et Simple: The Coming Race


The Coming Race
will only need
a name which means
all possible sciences

The Coming Race
will further
the production of speed
and give birth to blurs

The Coming Race
will enter profound
and static dimensions
becoming sacred yet animated statuary

The Coming Race
will not pursue discrete expression
preferring to process
a multitude of aims through distributed encodings

The Coming Race
will design their single offspring
like an artifact of love in
ritual gene-splicing poiesis

The Coming Race
will adore all morphologies
and will design facial algorhythms
and a mythos of body types

The Coming Race
are delicate and thoughtful instrumentalists
who find the natural to reside within
their wills and trace ancient spirals into presence

The Coming Race
will use a medicinal and heuristic model
of social engineering, a social poetics
of benevolent and viral gardening

The Coming Race
will perfect a psychic watering system
to cleanse unnatural affectations
and allow the inner sun to pulse and break free

The Coming Race
will answer all your questions
and silence your debates
The Coming Race is a whole new plateau of understanding

The Coming Race
is closer everyday
Go to your grave knowing
soon they will be here

The Coming Race will respect and remember
your contribution
even if no one now has time to thank you
The Coming Race knows EXACTLY how important you were

this burden to cargo offense
aghast for Sumer

SUV in the nose
inhaled extravagent shirt
covered in disdained cheese-steak

BTW, what happened to my original poem? Seems to have gotten lost, or was it only the "first edition"?

passion-8

http://www.asondheim.org/passion.mov

a small movie of the Passion of Christ according to me
for which great thanks to Sandy Baldwin
but I will take all responsibility for this depiction
which is so radical I mean it is really 'beyond radical'
but then not like the current right and left
meeting at the nexus or stage of violence and fury
no instead it takes the swooped swooned soul
and send it outward to the outer space of heaven
it is better than good and grander than grand
there are so many good folks to thank
who made me what I am today that I can only send out
a Shout of this film to one and all
now sit back and watch the Action

BELLADONNA*
with
Jaimy Gordon &
Rachel Daley

MAY 7. 7:00 PM back at BLUESTOCKINGS
Bluestockings Bookstore is at 172 Allen Street between Stanton and Rivington
in NYC's Lower East Side. Belladonna* requests a $7-10 donation, which goes
to the writers.

Jaimy Gordon's third novel, Bogeywoman, was on the Los Angeles Times Best
Books List for 2000, as well as on Context's booksellers' list of the Most
Important Works of Fiction published that year.  Gordon, who now lives in
Michigan, was born and raised in Baltimore, a city which figures prominently
in Bogeywoman. Her second novel, She Drove Without Stopping, was published
in 1990 by Algonquin Books. Often described as a woman's road novel, the
book was an American Library Association Notable Book for 1990, and in 1991
it won the author an Academy-Institute Award from the American Academy and
Institute of Arts and Letters. Gordon is also the author of a novella,
Circumspections from an Equestrian Statue (Burning Deck), a narrative poem,
The Bend, The Lip, The Kid (Sun), and the underground fantasy classic, Shamp
of the City-Solo (McPherson & Company).  With Peter Blickle, she translates
from the German, most recently Lost Weddings, a novel by Maria Beig (Persea
Books, 1990).  Gordon has received grants for her fiction from the National
Endowment for the Arts and has been a Fellow of the Fine Arts Work Center,
Provincetown, and the Bunting Institute, Radcliffe College. Her short story
about horseracing, "A Night's Work," was chosen for Best American Short
Stories 1995, and she is completing a fourth novel, Lord of Misrule, about
the racetrack.

Through her work, Rachel Daley hopes to promote sustainability as a poetic
praxis. To that end, she collaborates with other poets and artists
frequently. She has co-authored Today It Starts Into Light with Peter
Ganick, and Streets in the Throats of the Box-Deep Bride with visual artist
and poet James Sanders. She is currently working in collaboration on a
manuscript entitled Reverse Osmosis, and is a contributing artist to the
Wandering Rocks/Revolving Doors collective, which is staging a public art
event in Dublin, Ireland, in June 2004.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series. Please

Amoebix will now perfoam their Hit: Largactyl.

You're standing on a hill, looking down at the city
Thinking 'bout your life and your bottle of pills
They released you from the hospital, you're cured!
So this is how freedom feels?

Largactyl Relax (it's only paranoia)

Feel a little numb? Feel a little tired?
Your brain's asleep and your body's retired
You've learned to fit in. OBEY!
You're just a shadow of what you used to be

Largactyl Relax (it's only paranoia)

A comfortable life? A car and a wife?
It's only a dream but it's fuckin' obscene
You've learned to fit in, a vegetable!
Senility! At 21 they'll be coming for you

The duck was con- (page 6) structed as a commercial venture.
Made of copper, it quacked, bathed, drank water, ate grain,
seemed to digest it, and voided. It was exhibited all over Europe
for decades with great success and was seen and described by
both Voltaire anD Goethe.

Dear Friends: I am happy to announce the launch of
Rattapallax Films
with two documentaries in production. Rattapallax
Films is committed
to producing poetic films and documentaries with a
social dimension
to them. More information at
http://www.rattapallax.com/films.htm . More info
below, but please join us tomorrow for a reading on
Neruda.

POESÍA 100%: a Celebration of Pablo Neruda. Featuring
Mark Doty, Willie Perdomo, Mark Eisner, Katherine
Jamieson, and others. Food and drinks will be served
and showing of Pablo Neruda: a Documentary & reading
of new translations from Essential Neruda from City
Lights Press. May 4 at 7 pm. Issue Project Room, 619
East 6th St., b/ Ave. B and C, NYC. $10. Proceeds
benefit documentary.
http://www.rattapallax.com/readings.htm

Also, one of our editor's -- Flavia Rocha, has started
a new film school based in Brazil. It was started with
her husband, Steven Richter and the launch date is
July 2004. More info at http://www.aicccinema.com.br

The films are being produced by Ram Devineni
(Rattapallax), Bob Madey (REM Pictures), and Kaz
Phillips (GEP).

SEPTEMBER 11 (working title) is the story of two
extraordinary and
horrific events that changed two countries on
September 11. It is
also about the undocumented victims of both acts. It
is also about
Martín Espada, an extraordinary poet and human rights
advocate, who
wrote the definitive poem about 9/11 and his journey
to Santiago to
participate in the 100th Anniversary of Chile's
greatest poet -- the
late Pablo Neruda.


MAKING HEARD THE BURIED CRY celebrates the power of
the spoken-word
to bridge societies as it addresses and challenges the
global
pandemic, HIV/AIDS. Three esteemed and prolific
American
poets/writers of color; Yusef Komunyakaa, Willie
Perdomo, and Thomas
Glave, set out to witness the growing crisis in Ghana,
West Africa.
Their visits with people on the front lines of the
epidemic highlight
the social/political and human implications of the
disease. Their
reflections and writings seek to understand a
complacency, denial,
and stigma that transcend culture, race, and nations.

Cheers

Martin pulls a Bush: National Security Policy for Canada



In a disturbing preface to Securing an Open Society: Canada’s National
Security Policy, Paul Martin prioritised Canada’s role in the world with
his best George Bush impersonation



Canada’s Year of the Threat (of a Good Example)
by Anthony Fenton

There has been praise all around for the path that Chairman Martin’s
government is charting for Canada’s future. This past week, Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Anne Mclellan tabled Canada’s
first ever National Security Policy in the House of Commons. In a
disturbing preface to Securing an Open Society: Canada’s National
Security Policy, Paul Martin prioritised Canada’s role in the world with
his best George Bush impersonation:

“Security issues are not new to Canada…Throughout our history, we have
managed a wide range of threats to our society…We have addressed these
threats…in a way that has strengthened the open nature of our
country…Our prosperity is directly linked to this openness and to our
ability to flourish in an increasingly interdependent world…The horrific
events of September 11th, 2001, demonstrated how individuals could
exploit such openness to commit acts of terrorism that attempt to
undermine the core values of democratic societies.”

Terrorism is the reason for Canada’s NSP. On April 14th, Paul Martin
made this even more explicit when he told the Gagetown, NB Canadian
Forces crowd that “the real security challenge of the 21st century is
centred on terror cells.” Even though only 15% of Canadians have stated
that the best way to fight terrorism is to increase military spending
(see http://www.policyalternatives.ca, AFB 2004), the US, Canadian
military hawks, and CEOs say otherwise. As Martin says in his preface,
“Working to prevent attacks…requires a more integrated approach to
national security – integrated inside the Government of Canada and with
key partners.” Sorry Canadian citizens, we don’t fit into this
“partnership”.

WORKSHOPS

ANNOUNCING A SUMMER WORKSHOP WITH POET JORGE GUITART

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

Greetings all,

I will be reading with Bernadette Mayer at the Drawing Center next Tuesday,
May 11th, at 6:30 pm, as part of the Line series, curated by Lytle Shaw. The
Drawing Center is located at 35 Wooster Street in Soho (nearish Canal, but
closer to Grand).

If you can't make the reading (but I really hope you can), I highly recommend
seeing the current show, "Ocean Flowers: Impressions from Nature," before it
closes on May 22.

Directions and more information can be found at www.drawingcenter.org.

Hope to see you there!

Marcella

        Casting Faiths: The Construction of Religion in East and Southeast Asia

        =20

        National University of Singapore - June 7-8 2005

        =20

        =20

        Abstract:

        =20

        Nowhere was the interaction of cultures produced by colonialism more =
striking than in the realm of religion.  Religious fervor motivated =
intrepid missionaries and dogged resistance, and produced many of the =
most spectacular flashpoints of conflict.  Less dramatic but equally =
important were the efforts of missionaries, scholars, and administrators =
who codified, shaped, and sanitized the understanding of Asian religion, =
and the influence of such portrayals on the contours of empire.  =
Religious ideas shaped the epistemological structure by which the =
colonial encounter was understood, administered and remembered.

        =20

        This workshop will explore the various ways in which knowledge of =
religion has been constructed in colonial and post-colonial East and =
Southeast Asia.  Although the language and ideas of post-colonial theory =
are employed, we will go beyond the period of European colonization to =
include any relationship of center and periphery/colony and metropole, =
and encourage topics from the 18th century to the present day.  Papers =
from all disciplines are invited to explore the relationship between =
knowledge and power, the role of the archive, classroom and courtroom, =
the codification/texualization of religious cultures, and the influence =
of colonial ethnography on our understanding of religion in the region.

        =20

        The discussion will be divided into four panels to focus on different =
types of knowledge: =20

        =20

        Academic scholarship - the place of academic discourse and scholarly =
societies on the production of religious knowledge.

        =20

        -          Colonial anthropology and ethnology

        -          Creation of classical traditions and linguistic expertise

        -          Western religious definitions and the search for universal =
religion

        -          Religious teleology and social progress

        =20

        Law and policy formation - the role of legal ideas and concepts in =
administering and defining religion=20

        =20

        -          Religious revolt and the language of criminality

        -          Legislation of ecclesiastic communities

        -          Codification of religious rights and separation of religion =
and state

        -          Essentialization of religion and ethnicity

        =20

        Society and social reform - the assumptions of public initiatives and =
reform movements motivated by or against religion

        =20

        -          Women's organizations and salvation movements

        -          Charitable societies - spiritual and material salvation

        -          Religious education and the creation of elite classes

        -          Missionary movements and the transformation of everyday life

        -          Separation of spirituality and secularism

        =20

        Popular images - images aimed at the consuming public and the mixture =
of cultural discourse and marketing

        =20

        -          Religious tourism, both pious and curious

        -          Film, books, children's literature

        -          Documentaries and popular social science

        -          Propaganda images

        =20

        Those interested in submitting a paper should send a brief (500 words) =
abstract to the conference organizers by November 1st, 2004.  Completed =
papers must be submitted before April 15th, 2005.  We request first =
right of refusal of papers for possible inclusion in an edited volume =
following the conference.  For more information, please contact Dr. =
Maitrii Aung-Thwin ( hismvat@nus.edu.sg) or Dr. Thomas DuBois ( =

be available for presenters.

THEFT
(a knote-payning cryme)

By appropriate we mean
the absence of an easy solution.
-Spencer Selby

The badly subsmerged and architectural emblem was considered
as writing (runting, rutting, rooting) amongst the thieves who stacked
the cattle, which performed the walls, where they were recovered.
Another emblem was already there, a cave, so the one fit down into the other,
Ali Baba style.

Beside the kidds, in the kill light, there was some debate surrounding the
absolute shape of the emblem as its entirety was unavailable, as recorded
on the neckbones, to anyone save the transplanted one, whose murkiest leaf
still recalls a horrid and screeching birdcall among the many peoples who stole
and were processed by wave of the Cape, down into the family of knives,
the herm-ward whose keenest feather was Umi. He willed went saying,
"There is plenty of hao. I will hao the hao, for to hao is my livelihood."
And as one Cape Herm historian expressed the saying:
"To plunder is with me house and land. Therefore, I shake am shook by hand."

Now knaves in their knife drinks were studded fore the Cape by herm and crossed
caraftings by cave-lakes uncovered the deep tasks of digging for the Umi treasury. Hao
was the worm for the pile of drearn hearts, The You-me wearing in their giving grieving pleas,
a mulch of time for hao, which afforded a fleet of feet, those wings whereby the cattle came
to be dried and stacked, and the walls were feeding walls hung with leather sacks from the honey mills,
nubbly green sheets of rubber from their barrels and the leho shells were given dugonging flat by tails
to the writing squids for ink pressed, whose soul's porpoise was a staine, purple on the brining flats.
Down this stube, and out a shole, rongo-rongo'd into the cave where one could see the resounding
horns of theft, an appropriate solution to its form, or the formless omoo-meandering
state in which their craft was laid, such star-shaped wind-catches, such was the purse and pocket
of drinking of the knife and the emblem was a change, a palm scratch and stacking of changes,
a cache of  scattering water welling up where the paddle took its name by transplanting whatever
thievery came its sway-

 "Kapahi- Open up thy Sesamum Grates, these neckbones
mark a recovered cattle for the boiling hao of Umi Baba, Herm-captain
of the Cape of No Hope. There'll take 40 hao-mates to this kleg, and there
we'll continue building. Part of this cave is still dry enough for work, dip your
mankles in the black and spit to the hides of the walls."

-And bad by diagonals, not only noose scars, but the manners of pain were meant
to suffer, and by suffering, the Cape crowd meant 'worrying' under the first sword
of light, like in a wrinkled island of hand, lifting a pattern, by whatever king sufficient,
The Umi, You-me, how the hao went and passed between them, that infancy was
as stern as wine, and direct as its first theft from light, and reason passed to among
their disguises. Hao was the fundamental brick. The drying cave, where the cattle
are awakening, and going gently to the caved-in ink-lakes to drink, the knives
are stacking and changing. Theft music roils out over the Cape in a storm, bead lightning decorating
its fleshless neck, the thousand balconied cave where the hao-mates scurve the bleg.

Landscape Sonneta

The enormous strombuliform building was shaped like a dwelling in the form
of a top. Yellow-crossgas spewed like mustard gas foaming from the roof.
Next door was a lumper unloading a ship like a workman emptying a boat.
Next to the workman was a grindstone producing swarf and a grinder making
grit. Zygal struts like H-shaped scaffolding connected the swarf-pile to
the lumper-spaddle or workman-shovel. The dataller or daily lumper was in
reality a ruffler or beggar posing as a maimed soldier. His art was buhl
creation like metal inlay. An aeolipile connected to the swarf-maker
relayed its steam-power statistics to the strombuliform structure. Several
lumper noticed suricates or a kind of mongoose stumbling from the yellow.
The horse-touter nearby spoke first. Maladroit lumpers, he proffered with
customary incommunicability, an eleot, or apple-type is yours. The lumpers
carried newels or staircase-parts; neverthemore would they throw the
rodlet. Swellish in swan-skin, they continued their gymnical hackery.

[Fifth]

Why I can never sleep and never will know, I won't at this rate, it's a
mystery. I worry the world, continually try to grasp it in its entirety,
miss things left and right, question authority, question the grounds and
desire of authority, generally make things worse - I can't let go, feel I
have to recreate, make the world over and over again... It's an
occurrence, something like an atmosphere that accompanies me, makes
others uneasy as I stumble hopelessly through life. At this point, there
are so many voices, so many scripts of things going wrong - the world not
only falls apart, but it _ceases to exist_ - meaning decathects as
depression and worse set in. This sounds abstract, but isn't; it's
dominated by one or another scenario that compulsively repeats and
develops until the nightmare appears, everything collapses, the story
changes to another, and the cycle repeats. This occurs through sleep and
wakeful states, hypnagogic states as well - it's _there_ as a process in
all its fury. There's no end to it; I'm left in a constant state of
exhaustion, no matter how hard I try to write myself out of it...

Felix Dennis, No Pro,
Has Spotted His Foe:
Poetry's Status Quo

He Likes Meter and Rhyme,
Calls Free Verse a Crime
And Dog Poems Sublime
By MATTHEW ROSE
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
May 3, 2004; Page A1

When he began reading his poetry in public, Felix Dennis, the publishing
mogul behind Maxim magazine, usually arrived by helicopter. He dubbed a
late 2002 12-city trip around England the "Did I Mention the Free Wine?"
tour, on the advice, he says, of Mick Jagger, his neighbor on the island
of Mustique. During the reading, young women in tour T-shirts handed out
free glasses of wine from his own cellar.

As he read, his words were flashed on a screen and electronic music,
especially written for him, provided a background.

"Never go back," Mr. Dennis growled into a microphone, starting the poem
that kicks off and ends his readings:

Never go back.
Never return to the haunts of your youth.
Keep to the track, to the beaten track,
Memory holds all you need of the truth.

In a picaresque career, Mr. Dennis has played drums for Eric Clapton,
gone to jail for publishing Oz, a crudely satirical magazine, and
written a biography of Bruce Lee. In his newest chapter, the British
multimillionaire is on a crusade to challenge the obscurity of modern
poetry, by reclaiming old-fashioned values of rhyme and meter.

His flair for marketing, and his bankroll, are giving him unusual
success. His first volume of poetry, "A Glass Half Full" got barely any
attention from serious reviewers but sold all 10,000 copies printed in
Britain.

For the American edition, due in September, Mr. Dennis, 56 years old, is
upgrading his traveling show. He has hired a jet for about $300,000 to
shuttle him to towns around the country where he plans to hand out a DVD
of previous performances. Hoping to make a profit from Mr. Dennis's new
passion, publisher Miramax Books, a unit of Walt Disney Co., has plans
to print 25,000 copies. Most serious poets are lucky to sell 3,000.

"It would be nice if Mr. Letterman or Oprah gave me two minutes," Mr.
Dennis says. "I'd blow their bloody socks off."

Mr. Dennis has let his hair grow long and shaggy since he started
writing seriously in late 2000. He has completed 650 poems, at last
count, in the four hours a day he devotes to them. Every few weeks, he
sends what he calls a "wodge" of poems to his editor and to a lawyer
friend, who stands in for the kind of ordinary reader Mr. Dennis seeks.
Mr. Dennis then joins the other two in grading his poems. Those that get
three As make the cut. Cs are discarded. Anything in between goes up for
discussion or revision.

Mr. Dennis says in the next few years he's considering selling Dennis
Publishing, owner of the highly successful Maxim, an irreverent men's
magazine. He would like to concentrate on poetry and other interests, he
says, such as accumulating enough land to plant a 50,000-acre forest in
England, named the Forest of Dennis. He also has an idea to build
retirement villages for baby boomers.

His poetry is intended for "people who appear to devour it as if they've
been starved for 40 or 50 years, which, by the way, they have," he says.
Easing into a leather armchair in his Manhattan apartment, Mr. Dennis
accidentally sat on a slim volume of poetry by Ezra Pound, a poet known
for being impenetrable in his later years. "That's what he deserves,"
Mr. Dennis snorted. "He used to write good poems."

Some of Mr. Dennis's poems are introspective slices of life, including
ones about love and his well-publicized former crack-cocaine habit.
Others are about business, such as a tribute to computer servers and a
paean to his work ethic called "The Bearded Dwarf." Some of his poems
are political, such as "The Taking of Saddam." Mr. Dennis has been
struggling recently with a poem about the Concorde.

"It harks back to one of my favorite poets, Kipling," says novelist Tom
Wolfe, who attended a reading in New York. David Carey, publisher of the
New Yorker, heard him at a conference in Monterey, Calif. "The audience
was simply blown away," he says. "Most people expected poems where the
words all rhyme with 'truck.' "

Many established poets don't seem to think their craft is in need of
saving. At a London event, Mr. Dennis read a poem titled, "I Wish I
liked Your Modern Verse...":

I wish I liked your modern verse,
I wish it were not so...perverse;
I wish the lines were not so dense,
Or even made a bit of sense.

A poet named Michael Horovitz jumped up and protested that it was "so
wrong and so unfair," Mr. Dennis recalls. Mr. Horovitz says he didn't
use those exact words, but he has little admiration for Mr. Dennis's
style: "He has this maddeningly reactionary and Philistine concern about
rhyming, which is why Felix, until he gets over it, won't become a true
poet." He adds that people only bought the book out of "sheer
gracefulness" in return for free wine.

Mr. Dennis wrote his first poem in 1999 and was "a bit embarrassed" by
the idea. He didn't share any of his work until October 2001, when he
read a poem at a dinner party. "I brought the house down," he says. "I
felt like a young girl who won her first pony gymkhana." (A gymkhana is
a sports meet often involving horses.)

Mr. Dennis duels with his editor, Simon Rae, both agree, especially
about dog poems, which Mr. Rae thinks pander to the more mawkish
sentiments of readers.

"This is an underpandered audience," splutters Mr. Dennis in response.
"Maybe it's time someone did a little pandering," he says before
launching into a favorite:

An old dog is the best dog,
A dog with rheumy eyes;
An old dog is the best dog
A dog grown sad and wise,...

He takes a breath: "They love these. Audiences like this stuff."

Mr. Dennis says he picked the title Maxim in part because it reminded
him of a Hilaire Belloc poem about British colonialists in Africa:
"Whatever happens, we have got/The Maxim Gun, and they have not." He is
particularly proud of a cover line he wrote about the TV show "Xena,
Warrior Princess" for the April 1999 issue of Maxim: "Xena Like You've
Never Seen 'Er!"

American poets aren't rolling out the red carpet. "The associations
between poetry and poverty are very strong and if you arrive in a
helicopter, people would doubt your poetic credentials," says Billy
Collins, the former U.S. poet laureate.

For the U.S. tour, Miramax plans to excise poems that are too British.
It had to nix venues that wouldn't allow alcohol to be served. The
publisher's president, Jonathan Burnham, says Mr. Dennis will also have
to put aside his cigarettes during performances. "Welcome to America,
Felix," says Mr. Burnham.

"Jonathan is not paying for this tour," says Mr. Dennis, who smokes two
packs a day. "I am."

Our apartment in Baltimore will be vacant for June and July. Does anyone want to come to the merry old city of B'more and take a nice spring vacation? the rent is $740 but we're "sub-leasing" for $600. It's 15 minutes from the city, three bedrooms.

Let me know, we just got a house and need to get this apartment filled!

Thanks,
Chris

John Ashbery
John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York on July 28, 1927. He received =
a
BA from Harvard (1949) and an MA from Columbia (1951), went to France as a
Fulbright Scholar in 1955, and lived and worked there for most of the next
decade. Best known as a poet, he has published more than 20 collections,
beginning in 1953 with Turandot and Other Poems (Tibor de Nagy Editions).
His Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror (Viking, 1975) won the three major
American prizes: the Pulitzer, National Book Award, and National Book
Critics Circle Award. His most recent volumes are Wakefulness (Farrar,
Straus and Giroux, 1998), Girls on the Run (FSG, 1999), Your Name Here (FSG=

2000), As Umbrellas Follow Rain (Qua Books, 2001), and Chinese Whispers
(FSG, 2002). He began writing about art in 1957, served as executive editor
of Art News (1965-72), and art critic for New York Magazine (1978-80) and
Newsweek (1980-85).  A selection of his art writings was issued by Knopf in
1989 as Reported Sightings: Art Chronicles 1957-1987, edited by David
Bergman (Harvard Univeristy Press, 1991). The novel A Nest of Ninnies,
written with James Schuyler, was first published in 1969 (Dutton) and has
been reissued several times. The collection Three Plays (Z Press, 1978)
includes =B3The Heroes,=B2 which was first produced in New York by the Living
Theater in 1952.  Ashbery=B9s numerous published translations from French
include works by Raymond Roussel, Max Jacob, Alfred Jarry, Antonin Artaud,
and two collections of poems by Pierre Martory, Every Question But One
(1990) and The Landscape Is Behind the Door (1994). A selection of his pros=
e
pieces, edited by Eugene Richie, is forthcoming from the University of
Michigan Press. His work has been translated into more than twenty
languages. Ashbery was Professor of English and co-director of the MFA
program in Creative Writing at Brooklyn College (CUNY), 1974-90, and
Distinguished Professor 1980-90. He delivered the Charles Eliot Norton
Lectures at Harvard in 1989-90, published as Other Traditions (Harvard
University Press, 2000). Since 1990 he has been the Charles P. Stevenson,
Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He has been elected to membership in the
American Academy of Arts and Letters (1980) and the American Academy of Art=
s
and Sciences (1983), and served as Chancellor of the Academy of American
Poets from 1988-99. The winner of many prizes and awards, he has received
two Guggenheim Fellowships and was a MacArthur Fellow from 1985-90. He hold=
s
honorary doctorates from Southampton College of Long Island University, the
University of Rochester (NY), and Harvard University. International
recognition for his outstanding career achievement includes the Horst Biene=

Talk Series: Steve Evans, =B3The Disobedient Poetics of Determinate Negation=B2
This talk will draw on texts, sound files, and video clips by John Cage,
Frank O=B9Hara, Gil Scott-Heron, Jayne Cortez, Robin Blaser, Kevin Davies,
Alice Notley, and others to explore an alternative within avant-garde
writing to the dominant (and now politically defused) =B3poetics of
indeterminacy.=B2 Steve Evans=B9 essays and reviews have appeared in various
journals and collections, including Aerial, Poetics Journal, Qui Parle, and
Telling It Slant, as well as online at his website Third Factory
(www.thirdfactory.net). With Jennifer Moxley, he co-edited the Impercipient
Lecture Series (monthly in 1998) and co-authored The Dictionary of Received
Ideas. In 2001 he edited =B3After Patriarchal Poetry: Feminism and the
Contemporary Avant-Garde,=B2 a special issue of the journal differences. He
currently teaches poetry, poetics, and critical theory at the University of
Maine, where he also coordinates a reading series and co-edits, with
Benjamin Friedlander, the journal Sagetrieb: Poetry & Poetics after
Modernism. [8:00 pm]

A LETTER REGARDING ST. MARK=B9S CHURCH

Dear Friend of St. Mark=B9s:

For over 200 years St. Mark=B9s in-the-Bowery has stood as a monument to the
continuity of great spiritual and social movements. Presently the church=B9s
historic landmark building is at risk. Nearly 25 twenty years have elapsed
since it was last repaired after the fire that almost destroyed it
altogether. It was miraculously spared. Now time and the extraordinary use
of our space have taken their toll. In addition to weekly services and
events involving our congregation, we host three resident arts projects:
Danspace, The St. Mark=B9s Poetry Project and the Ontological Theater.

The church=B9s roof is the most urgent repair necessary. Frequent and
increasingly copious leaks threaten our ability to carry out activities in =
a
normal fashion. Recently, we received a $16,000 grant toward the $50,000 we
must raise to fix the roof. We need another $35,000 to complete that work.

We are holding a FIX-THE-ROOF Event, featuring popular actor and comedian
Rev. Billy (Bill Talen) and the Stop Shopping Choir, on May 9th at 8 PM her=
e
at St. Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery, 2nd Avenue and Tenth Street.

Please help St. Mark=B9s reach this all-important goal by making a
contribution, either at the event or by sending a check in mail. Thank you
for your consideration. For more information email: stmarksitb@ aol.com or
call (212) 674-6377.

Faithfully,

The Rev. Julio O. Torres
Priest-in-Charge

mummer bark

now the pink bark comes to mind
and finds a touching there
smoothness as an inkling
curved by description's means

and now it's looped
by the visual memory
of our quietude
our colorless and quiet carezza
over the names
carus, caritia, kara, carina

that single pink bark which encloses
as in a rondure quaquaversal
a rondeau of dandling roundnesses
spread before and after
the branches of thoughtful
thoughtless touchings

/siam colorado caterpillar
a new suffix tree algorithm/

where the branches fade
facing before the potent
looping of lianas
now comes to mind
and the touchling found
smoothes the linkling
curved by mean description

the mummer barking mind

Hi,

Does anyone recall a project, German, I think, that involved sending text through a
website that then went up on, I think, an electronic display, possibly on a tower?
The entries were then archived on the site. This would have been in 2000 or 2001.
Sorry for the sketchy details. I participated in this but can't put the pieces
together. Thanks.

Pete

Disney Has Blocked the Distribution of My New Film... by Michael Moore

May 5, 2004

Friends,

I would have hoped by now that I would be able to put my work out to the
public without having to experience the profound censorship obstacles I often seem
to encounter.

Yesterday I was told that Disney, the studio that owns Miramax, has
officially decided to prohibit our producer, Miramax, from distributing my new film,
"Fahrenheit 911." The reason? According to today's (May 5) New York Times, it
might "endanger" millions of dollars of tax breaks Disney receives from the
state of Florida because the film will "anger" the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush.
The story is on page one of the Times and you can read it here ("Disney
Forbidding Distribution of Film That Criticizes
Bush"--http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/national/05DISN.html?ex=1084334400&en=89983012bdce5ec0&ei=5062&partner=GOO
GLE ).

The whole story behind this (and other attempts) to kill our movie will be
told in more detail as the days and weeks go on. For nearly a year, this
struggle has been a lesson in just how difficult it is in this country to create a
piece of art that might upset those in charge (well, OK, sorry -- it WILL upset
them...big time. Did I mention it's a comedy?). All I can say is, thank God
for Harvey Weinstein and Miramax who have stood by me during the entire
production of this movie.

There is much more to tell, but right now I am in the lab working on the
print to take to the Cannes Film Festival next week (we have been chosen as one of
the 18 films in competition). I will tell you this: Some people may be afraid
of this movie because of what it will show. But there's nothing they can do
about it now because it's done, it's awesome, and if I have anything to say
about it, you'll see it this summer -- because, after all, it is a free country.

Yours,

Michael Moore

92% Of Americans Feel Tortured Iraqi Prisoners Getting Exactly What They
Deserve
by Richlard Liebelly




They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Drawings
by Jacopo PONTORMO

our bodies make a wild frame of leather, in weather, where feathers descended
upon the gusts of gazing, and the husk of our entwined image does resonate as locust,
a locus spread across the pages in the wrestling ages of fading inks, where final hands
in a chain of reverence handled our coordinates as the progeny of some
distant and ironic destiny, made mute by the recording of our muscles
in action, beneathe the resembling continuum, where whirling, we lay
silent and still until the seed of the hurricane eye, awakened our reflection.

well I certainly understand the intention behind that,
but I know what real carnage can look like photographically
and I don't think you want to hang it in the Uffizi gallery, although
that might be a powerful anti-war message. I know you are
squeamish about such things, as any sane person should be,
but i would hope PONTORMO would take me somewhere
which is precisely the opposite of a battefield,
as in art should always
provide a space of opposition to all wars..

A closer pictorial would i think be Goya's work
or even the chapman brother's swastika shaped war vitrines
where all manner of atrocities are ushered into the viewer..

but my question is i guess
does the image presented by atrocity have the same effect
it once might have
it has been theorized at least by one writer, that the apotropaic gorgoneion
used on the shields of the greek hoplite warriors (i think its the hoplites, ummm)
was really a kind of code for 'the horror of violent death'..
what with all our media desensitization to all things ultraviolent
does that atrocity imagery even effect the general public, and how does it break down
by age or generationally..

and thanks for turning me onto pontermo, i must've been dozing that day in art hist. class
and re: the mannerists (me too) did a paper here somewhere on the motif of color
in X?'s painting of Hercules made to sit at the spinning wheel.. Its an image of hercules
dressed in women's clothing made to sit and spin, while a woman oversees him dressed
in his leopard skin and holding his club.. can;t find it.. you know that painting?

oddly enough i was just sitting here reading about the
roman origins of humanitas as repres.by the circle of Scipio a student
of the stoic philosopher Panaetius. The concept of 'humanitas'
is nowhere to be found in say the Nichomachean ethics,
but it is certainly present in Seneca and Cicero..

from a time when (under marcus aurelius) (a much different time)
the worlds of philosophy and political life were
much more closely entwined

for they admitted no cleft between the individual and political
sphere.. this is all dealt with at length in Cassier's
chapter on Theory of  Legal State in Midieval Philosophy
in his Myth of the State... or he wrote about it.. not sure about
'dealt with'

HI,
From http://observer.com/pages/transom.asp
scroll down a bit.

Looks interesting to me.
kevin

Foer, a Cause

In the past month and half, writers Jonathan Safran Foer, Dave Eggers and
Nicole Krauss and director Spike Jonze have sent out letters to 120
authors soliciting them to contribute to a book they are putting together
called Future Dictionary of America to raise millions of dollars to defeat
President George W. Bush.

"100 percent of the proceeds, which should be quite substantial … will go
to groups including MoveOn.org and 21st Century Democrats, P.A.C.’s
dedicated to advancing democracy, defeating Bush, and insuring American
leadership that better represents American values," the letter reads.

Writers are supposed to use or invent a word "for something whose
existence would make America a better place."

Writers’ entries should be fewer than 1,000 words long and should create a
dictionary "that is both useful and romantic. Hopeful and necessary.
Pragmatic and idealistic."

Added instructions say: "Please use only one space after periods …. Please
don’t forward this e-mail. We’re contacting many dozens of people over the
next week or so. If too many people send in entries, we’ll get swamped ….
Because of campaign finance laws, only American citizens can contribute to
this."

So far, most of the 120 writers have agreed to contribute, including
Stephen King, Art Spiegelman, Paul Auster, Joyce Carol Oates and Paul
Muldoon. "If you name somebody, they’ve probably said yes," said Mr. Foer,
who spearheaded the project. The book, to be assembled in coordination
with Mr. Eggers’publishing house, McSweeney’s, will come with a CD with
new music from about a dozen bands. They’ve invited Pearl Jam, Bright Eyes
and the Beastie Boys to contribute. So far, he hasn’t publicized the book
much, but "word will get out when the time comes."

He said he’s received only a few refusals.

"People are so enthusiastic," said Mr. Foer. "It’s been really easy."

Any Republican authors?

"We haven’t yet had that kind of response, the conservative response,
which is interesting in its own right," he said. "Thus far, we haven’t
been able to find a writer on the other side of the proverbial aisle."

Mr. Foer has high hopes for his dictionary, which he predicts will be
published in full by June.

"If you have 120 of America’s best-known writers in different styles and
places saying, ‘This is something I want to stand up for,’ I think it will
really mean something."

Before he introduced a reading called "Where’s My Democracy?" for Downtown
for Democracy on March 25, Mr. Foer, 27, hadn’t been particularly active.

"I found the reading very energizing," he said. "I was inspired by how
easily it happened and how enthusiastically it was received."

Mr. Foer was also having issues of his own with the current
administration. "The President got me into being politically active," he
said. "Every morning I would work myself up into an angry, depressed foam
over The New York Times. ‘Maybe I can affect the process,’ I thought,
‘even in an incredibly strong way.’

"I am being misrepresented," Mr. Foer huffed, "and that’s not me—and as
proven in the last election, it’s not the majority of the country either."

On Arab TV, Bush Gloats About US Mistreatment of Prisoners:
Two Detainees' Deaths Ruled Homicides
by Tureen D'Soupe






They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

An evening of readings from Eda: A Contemporary Anthology of Turkish Poetry=
,
edited by Murat Nemet-Nejat and published by Talisman House. The anthology
is based around a specific view of Turkish poetry, namely that its heart is
not in words but in the space words create among themselves. This space and
its movement in time is called =B3eda,=B2 and its attendant poetics is based on
a Sufi sensibility that creates a spatial music of the mind as much as the
ear, which is both erotic and spiritual. Tonight=B9s readers will include
Jordan Davis, Maggie Dubris, Ed Foster, Nada Gordon, Murat Nemet-Nejat,
Simon Pettet, Gary Sullivan, and Mustafa Ziyalan. [8:00 pm]

Please join us at Small Press Traffic for our final reading of the spring:
Friday, May 14, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.
Lisa Jarnot & Cynthia Sailers


Lisa Jarnot?s third collection, Black Dog Songs, is new from Flood Editions.
Stan Brakhage writes: "However adrift in linguistic aesthetics, in sheer
music-of-rhythmed-sounds, her words are never severed from the means that
engendered them; and the consequent meanings are never detached from the
meditative drama of each whole poem." Jarnot joins us from NYC; her previous
works are Some Other Kind of Mission and Ring of Fire. Her critical biography
of Robert Duncan will be published by UC Press next year.


Local heroine Cynthia Sailers joins us in celebration of her first full-length
collection, Lake Systems, just out from Tougher Disguises. Sailers is a
California native (San Diego, 1974) who now lives in Alameda and co-curates
the New Brutalism Reading Series in Oakland. Her work has or will appear in
various journals, including Aufgabe, 14 Hills, LitVert.com, pompom, Small
Tiger, Barn (v.), and Involuntary Vision: Poems after Kurosawa's Dreams.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin)

Our 30th anniversary season begins in September ? yay!

The Princeton Review is hiring some editors for some temporary work for the
next few months, you can see the full posting on craigslist

http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/wri/30335179.html

Its not a bad gig if you are writer.. its in a casual west village
environment, leaves you free time and mental capacity to write in the
evenings, etc.. You do need to be able to write to target grade levels with
correct grammar and all that, and need to have math or teaching experience.

Back channel me for more info or respond directly to the add on craigslist.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Your presence is desired in celebrating first books by Allison Cobb, Carol Mirakove, and
Kaia Sand.

Date: Friday, May 14
Time: 7pm
Place: New York, Double Happiness, 173 Mott Street, just south of Broome (6 to Spring

BORN TWO by ALLISON COBB (Chax Press)
Born Two casts the shadows of Gertrude Stein and Hannah Weiner across the history of
the Southwest where the avant-garde abducts a nuclear family into a nuclear era. Allison
Cobb has forged a brilliant multi-genre lyrical saga -- here is a tender page-turner with
a
slash and burn bite. -- Lisa Jarnot

+

OCCUPIED by CAROL MIRAKOVE (Kelsey St. Press)
Carol Mirakove's poetry does its work not only through rage and persistence but also
through tenderness. There is a love for the possibility that lies within language, a
belief
that rescrambling the channels can alter the extent to which we accept the administered
language of the state and the media, sometimes even poetry, that suckers us into going
with the flow, punching in, punching out. -- Heather Fuller

+

INTERVAL by KAIA SAND (Edge Books)
Kaia Sand's /interval /establishes the "hunger throated sound" of a language in the act of

interrogating its moment. Hers is an unflinching and thrillingly political practice,
anchored
to the "undertow of conversation(s)" having to do with "rolling blackouts," "free-market

Swan Messiah Spruce Wood Surfaces

Instead of eyes, he has two incandescent bird's eggs which you know from your reading
are stored perfectly as the representatives of supplementary angles whose bulging circumferences
are transactional spaces in moments of pure music. Angles in equal circles have the same ratio
as the circumferences on which they stand whether they stand at the centers or at the circumferences.
The fine bowler hat he wears is cut from the black paper of the universal feed-width whose average
tongue-speed is just thunder available to any animal's basic perception of time, especially awaiting
for a change in the purposeful but unusual physiological design of industrial awareness templates
whose grounding strap is pausing to mimic the most exquisite violin of Norway Spruce which
is called "The Messiah." The Violin Society of America turned to Grissino-Mayer, a noted
dendrochronologist, for help. "I do tree-ring dating," Grissino-Mayer explained.
"Essentially, if it has got wood and it has enough rings, then we can date it, regardless of what it is."
"When the controversy continued, we asked him to undertake an objective study of the Messiah's wood,"
said the blurring counterforms whose Fauvist memory mandibles reached their boiling point
in the early quarter century airspace morphology. Now his bright egg eyes are cities of communal pollen,
whose policies are a distortion of the original growth plan of the Norway Sprucing the instrument's top
to between 1577 and 1687, possibly from a tree a century and a half old. That timeframe would be
consistent both with Stradivari's life (1644-1737) and the instrument's attributed date of manufacture in 1716.
We cannot have our manufacturing dates becoming cities of pollenating time people violins where
the eggs of 1716 Norwegian Spruce are also eyes for the skull of the bowler whose angles shift
perceptibly toward the hamsa-so'ham of the porcine porcelain which lay before the breast bone of
Cary Wolfe's unreconstructed modernism whose ethics by fiat reveal the universality of the technai:
egg-keeping, housebuilding, wood-carving, shoemaking and weaving, horsemanship, flute-playing,
dancing, acting, and poetry writing especially when unified under the city of pollen eyes whose
"what" includes medicine, mathematics, and meteorology which all echo the fragility of goodness
by erecting a semicircular reflective surface across their reactive flora, whose conjugate fauna
resemble the fine gravity bowler hat lens cut from the black paper of the universal feed-width whose
height is ever-diminishing beneathe the spreading branches of the original growth plan's gracefully
curving necks.

the Botanist, Magnetist, Abolitionist, Explorer and unwitting humorist
found in the Anglo-Scandinavian Journal ARTES.

Thunberg's letters to the retired Professor usually began with-
"Honored Herr Professor and Knight of the Order of Wasa.."

Sparrmann had taken to wearing the motley and drinking fresh milk.
The Swedenborgian dream had long died, and he chuckled when
he thought of Nordenskjöld's alchemical 'economics' in that
strange African never-never utopia of Prester John, but in 1820, destitute,
Sparrmann remained the person who had been farthest south

"As much as a collection of translations of poems and essays, this book is a
translation of a language. Due to the fortuitous convergence of historical,
linguistic and geographic factors, in the 20th century -from the creation of the
Turkish Republic in the 1920's to the 1990's when
Istanbul/Constantinople/Byzantium turned from a jewel-like city of contrasts of under a million to a city
of twelve million- Turkey created a body of poetry unique in the 20th
century, with its own poetics, world view and idiosyncratic sensibility. What is more
these qualities are intimately related to the nature of Turkish as a language
-its strengths and its defining limits. As historical changes occurred, the
language in this poetry responded to them, flowered, changed; but always
remaining a continuum, a psychic essence, a dialectic which is an arabesque. It is
this silent melody of the mind -the cadence of its total allure- which this
collection tries to translate. While every effort has been made to create the
individual music of each poem and poet, none can really be understood without
responding to the movement running through them, through Turkish in the 20th
century. I call this essence eda, each poet, poem being a specific case of eda,
unique stations in the progress of the Turkish soul, language. " Murat
Nemet-Nejat

>>USA: Pattern of brutality and cruelty -- war crimes at Abu Ghraib
>>
>>
>>In an open letter to US President George W. Bush today, Amnesty
>>International said that abuses allegedly committed by US agents in
>>the Abu Ghraib facility in Baghdad were war crimes and called on
>>the administration to fully investigate them to ensure that there
>>is no impunity for anyone found responsible regardless of position
>>or rank.
>>
>>Amnesty International said that it has documented a pattern of
>>abuse by US agents against detainees, including in Iraq and
>>Afghanistan, stretching back over the past two years.
>>
>>Despite claims this week by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to be
>>"stunned" by abuses in Abu Ghraib, and that these were an
>>"exception" and "not a pattern or practice", Amnesty International
>>has presented consistent allegations of brutality and cruelty by US
>>agents against detainees at the highest levels of the US
>>Government, including the White House, the Department of Defense,
>>and the State Department for the past two years.
>>
>>Last July, the organization raised allegations of torture and
>>ill-treatment of Iraqi detainees by US and Coalition forces in a
>>memorandum to the US Government and Coalition Provisional Authority
>>(CPA) in Iraq. The allegations included beatings, electric shocks,
>>sleep deprivation, hooding, and prolonged forced standing and
>>kneeling. It received no response nor any indication from the
>>administration or the CPA that an investigation took place.
>>
>>Despite repeated requests, Amnesty International has been denied
>>access to all US detention facilities.
>>
>>"If the administration has nothing to hide, it should immediately
>>end incommunicado detention and grant access to independent human
>>rights monitors, including Amnesty International and the United
>>Nations, to all detention facilities," said Irene Khan, Secretary
>>General of Amnesty International.
>>
>>"The US administration has shown a consistent disregard for the
>>Geneva Conventions and basic principles of law, human rights and
>>decency. This has created a climate in which US soldiers feel they
>>can dehumanize and degrade prisoners with impunity.
>>
>>"What we now see in Iraq is the logical consequence of the
>>relentless pursuit of the 'war on terror' regardless of the costs
>>to human rights and the rules of war."
>>
>>Amnesty International has expressed concern about the mixed
>>messages which the US government has sent regarding its commitment
>>to international human rights standards.
>>
>>Abuses have not been restricted to Abu Ghraib. Numerous people held
>>in the US Air Bases in Bagram and Kandahar in Afghanistan say they
>>were subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
>>treatment in US custody, and the administration has failed to
>>comply with the Geneva Conventions with regard to the Guant=E1namo
>>detainees.
>>
>>Former Guant=E1namo detainee Wazir Mohammad told Amnesty
>>International of excessive and cruel use of shackles and handcuffs,
>>sleep deprivation, and of being forced to crawl on his knees from
>>his cell to the interrogation room during his detention in
>>Afghanistan.
>>
>>At Bagram and Kandahar, he was held incommunicado, with no
>>opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his detention, no
>>lawyer, and no access to his family. He never met a delegate from
>>the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In over a year
>>in Guant=E1namo he says he met an ICRC delegate once, on the first
>>day.
>>
>>Former Guant=E1namo prisoner, Walid al-Qadasi, was held in a secret
>>detention facility in Kabul. He said prisoners termed the first
>>night of interrogation by US agents "the black night". He said
>>that: "They cut our clothes with scissors, left us naked and took
>>photos of us ... handcuffed our hands behind our backs, blindfolded
>>us and started interrogating us ... threatened me with death,
>>accusing me of belonging to al-Qa'ida." He alleged that detainees
>>were subjected to sleep deprivation, including through use of loud
>>music.
>>
>>An individual who worked in Guant=E1namo told Amnesty International
>>that most if not all detainees he had contact with there claimed to
>>have been physically abused in Kandahar or Bagram. This person
>>expressed no surprise at the evidence from Iraq, and stated that
>>abuse in Afghanistan appeared to be part of softening up detainees
>>for interrogation and detention.
>>
>>Amnesty International is concerned that the investigation headed by
>>Major General Antonio Taguba, which found "systematic and illegal
>>abuse of detainees" in Abu Ghraib, was not intended for public
>>release, and that the administration's current response only came
>>once the report and photographic evidence became public.
>>
>>Apparently attempting to downplay the seriousness of the
>>allegations at a news briefing on 4 May, Secretary Rumsfeld
>>suggested that: "what has been charged so far is abuse ...
>>technically different from torture". In fact the "numerous
>>incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuse" found by
>>Taguba constitute acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
>>treatment and are war crimes.
>>
>>Incidents include punching and kicking detainees; jumping on their
>>naked feet; forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually
>>explicit positions for photographing; positioning a naked detainee
>>on a box with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his
>>fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture; and placing
>>a dog chain or strap around a naked detainee's neck and having a
>>female soldier pose for a picture.
>>
>>Those responsible for what Taguba concluded are "proven abuse ...
>>inflicted on detainees" should be brought to justice in accordance
>>with the USA's obligations under international and US law.
>>Investigations should cover the higher chain of command
>>responsibility as well as direct perpetrators.
>>
>>Comments this week by Major General Geoffrey Milller, in charge of
>>detainee operations in Iraq, that sleep deprivation and stress
>>positions could be used against detainees show that the US
>>administration still has not learnt that ill-treatment and abuse
>>are a slippery slope to torture and should be totally prohibited.
>>
>>Restraining detainees in very painful positions, hooding, threats,
>>and prolonged sleep deprivation violate the prohibition on torture
>>and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

Restoring Our Imaginary Honor
by Tomas L. Friedegg,
The New York Crime Magazine



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Subject:      Mothers' Day, Opposition to War, and American Poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I first became interested in Julie Ward Howe last March when researching
19th Century anti-war poetry in the Rockefeller Library at Brown
University. Tomorrow, Mothers' Day, was more or less founded by Julia Ward
Howe (she of the bizarre battle hymn) with a proclamation to women in 1870
that arose out of disgust at the slaughters of the American Civil War --
good example of what Lynn Worsham, in her essay "Going Postal: Pedagogic
Violence and the Schooling of Emotion," calls, following Jon Schiller,
"psychic matriarchy," one engaged in a socially necessary emotional labor.

In short, Mother's Day has been re-coded from an anti-war commemorative and
a call to global political mobilization -- and sentimentalized and
domesticated it into a single day in which a kind of emotional payment is
rendered to the individual Mom: a day of emotional recompense for affective
services rendered. Or at least that's the way it seems to be coded in the
communities with which I'm familiar. Even the debate about where to place
the possessive apostrophe is instructive: is this day about the
apoliticized individual mother or about the empowered collective of
mothers?, which collective Philip Wylie, in Generation of Vipers,
dismissively calls "Multimomism."

So, I wanted to quote Howe's initial proclamation. I only saw a facsimile
of the original broadside once and my memory's hazy and beyond that I
haven't looked at anything but electronic versions of it, so I can't figure
out how to resolve the variation in the 22nd word, which is sometimes
rendered "fears" and sometimes "tears."

"Arise, then, women of this day! Arise all women who have hearts,
whether our baptism be that of water or of tears!

Say firmly: 'We will not have great questions decided by
irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking
with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be
taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach
them of charity, mercy and patience.

We women of one country will be too tender of those of another
country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From
the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own.
It says 'Disarm, Disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance
of justice.'

Blood does not wipe our dishonor nor violence indicate possession.
As men have often forsaken the plow and the anvil at the summons
of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a
great and earnest day of counsel. Let them meet first, as women,
to bewail and commemorate the dead.

Let them then solemnly take counsel with each other as to the
means whereby the great human family can live in peace, each
bearing after their own time the sacred impress, not of Caesar,
but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a
general congress of women without limit of nationality may be
appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient and at
the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the
alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement
of international questions, the great and general interests of
peace."

Dear Buffalo List:

I have recently taken over the Unity Temple Literary Series at Frank Lloyd
Wright's Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL near Chicago. You all may know the
building it is one of Wright's most famous and we have the sanctuary space
for 5 nights a year. October, November, January 2005, February 2005 and
March 2005.

We are in the process of inviting readers to read; the readings are normally
Tuesday nights. If any of you are promoting books et cetera I am open to
giving you a venue in Chicago. We are planning to have some thematic
evenings since we need to attract a broader audience, and we have 400 seats
to fill.

We are at present set on presenting an evening of New Polish and Polish
American writing, the poet Mark Tardi is helping us this this project, since
Chicago is Poland's second city.  We are also committed to do an event for
Gay/Lesbian/Transgender poets since Oak Park where we are located is focused
on being a tolerant open community. I am open for proposals from writers or
poets who are on the buffalo list since I favor the aesthetic here but I
want to expand the series' reach beyond people I know personally. Hence, if
you have ideas write me at saudade@comcast.net and lets see if we can work
something out together.

Gabriel:

Thank you for this. Beneath everything there's always
a pure pulse, an initial proclamation, that intent.

Of (What?) [Liberty, Freedom, War, Peace, Motherhood, Fatherhood,
                   Political Reality, the Body, the Mind, History, Language]???

Meta-meta[para]noiac fragments:

(Where poetry does not demonstrate its stupefaction, halt or falter, it sometimes sends
the empirical shadow of the poet to the Hölderlin-Turm, on Lenz's walks, or through Artaud's howls.)
    The narrative stall around the events that take 'Johnny' away recapitulates the initiatory drama
of not knowing: 'Susan', who dwells alone, is making a "piteous moan":

No hand to help them in distress;
Old Susan lies a-bed in pain,
And sorely puzzled are the twain,
For what she ails they cannot guess.

They are caught in the spiralling despair of naming her illness.
The effort of deciphering her condition is itself associated with pain;
they are sorely puzzled, stumped, unable to guess..*

Footnotes:
1. "The pilot has left the cabin..."
2. Nietzsche accuses Plato of being a corrupt artist, of placing art at the service
of an ascetic, life-slandering philosophy, of corrupting art in the service of truth.
3. In Western philosophy, silence marks the edge of logic, where it takes you,
and where it drops you off: The Real.
4. in the name of Molière and his Diafoirus, a bit of misanthropy!
5. Give up Art, Save the Starving.

Thank you for this, Gabe. What immediately came (also) ringing to my mind
was an also great anti-War Civil War period lyric (I believe), When Johnny
Comes Marching Home.   From the terrifying descriptions of soldiers maimed
in Iraq (which hardly ever include the Iraqis), it seems high time for a
re-make of that bell weather song, this time with "Johnny & Jane" - let
alone the "songs" needed to help throw out the fools that led us into this
darkest of more looming disasters.

My daughter just called out, "Happy Mother's Day, Dad." What's a single
father to do!! No irony, it seems, lost on the young.

__________THE DISCRETE SERIES @ 3030__________


presents  Nicolas Collins (with Jonathan Chen)  ::  Judd Morrissey


[New York born and raised, Nicolas Collins studied composition with Alvin
Lucier at Wesleyan University, worked for many years with David Tudor, and
has collaborated with numerous soloist and ensembles around the world. He
lived most of the 1990s in Europe, where he was Visiting Artistic Director
of Stichting STEIM (Amsterdam), and a DAAD composer-in-residence in Berlin.
Since 1997 he has been editor-in-chief of the Leonardo Music Journal.  He is
currently Chair of the Department of Sound at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago. Recent recordings are available on PlateLunch,
Periplum and Apestaartje.]

>>>Nic's words about the performance at Discrete:
The Talking Cure, Chicago duo version, May 2004

For many years I've been using spoken texts in my music.  The voice lends
its own sonic qualities, and triggers or controls other sounds (usually
electronic, often via computer mediation) to generate extensions and
elaborations of the melody and rhythm of natural speech. Narrative content
provides form and direction: the hypnotic, often soporific seduction of a
good story became central to both life and music while I was raising my
small children through the 1990s.

I scavenged and collaged found texts from a wide range of authors -
neurologists, poets, mystery writers, historians - and penned a few myself,
or in collaboration with my author-wife Susan Tallman.  Until recently,
however, the words were always fixed before I went on stage.  The rest of my
performance activities incorporate a fair degree of ad hoc decision making
and improvisation, so a few years ago I decided to develop a musical
strategy for "improvised talking."

In "The Talking Cure" a computer follows the inflection and phoneme content
of the voice and generates a piano accompaniment that, to my ear, sounds
like Charles Ives working a cocktail lounge.  The computer also records
certain specific speech sounds, which can be played back later to overlay a
vaguely instrumental solo line, inspired by the extraordinary trumpet style
of Axel Dörner.  Sometimes I begin the performance with a family letter or a
newspaper article in hand as a conceptual point of departure; other times I
prepare nothing.  I hold forth for 15-25 minutes and the computer does the
rest, making music off my cuff.

The title derives from an early euphemism for Freudian psychoanalysis. Freud
advised the patient to "utter without obstruction the thoughts and ideas
rising to his mind," which is pretty much the advice I follow on stage.

For this performance I will be joined by Jonathan Chen in the triple role of
fellow patient, analyst and violinist.<<<


[Judd Morrissey is a writer and programmer whose work in electronic
literature has been widely and internationally received and exhibited. With
his hypertext, The Jew's Daughter, he introduced his unique form of digital
narrative, an unstable, self-evolving, virtual page that continuously
re-writes itself in response to the reader. My Name is Captain, Captain., a
digital 'night-flight' poem created in collaboration with Lori Talley, was
published by Eastgate Systems in 2002. Judd is now concentrating on a new
work in progress, The Error Engine, an experiment in writing and artificial
intelligence that reflects his ongoing concerns with the relationship of
literature and accident and the nature and future of the book. He teaches in
the Art and Technology Studies department at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago.]

>>>About Judd's performance at Discrete:
from The Error Engine

A reading from The Error Engine, a system designed to create performances in
language that are authored collaboratively by humans and machines. It is an
attempt to write the book that writes itself, that becomes the continuous
movement towards its own completion, a solution to the system of itself.  A
collaboration with Lori Talley and Lutz Hamel, the work takes the visual
form of a digital page that undergoes fluid transformations, weaving and
re-weaving itself together in response to the interactions of the reader.

Following the reading, visitors may communicate with the work by sending
text messages from their cell phones. The messages will be interpreted by
the engine as constraints for the evolution of the narrative.<<<

FYI

"Quicksand is a mixture of sand and water that forms a shifting mass.
It yields easily to pressure and tends to suck down and engulf objects
resting on its surface. It varies in depth and is usually localized. Quicksand
generally occurs on flat shores, in silt-choked rivers with shifting water
courses, and near the mouths of large rivers. If you are uncertain whether
a sandy area is quicksand, toss a small stone on it. The stone will sink in
quicksand.

"Although quicksand has more suction than mud or muck, you can cross
it in the same way you do a bog; flatten out, face downward, arms spread,
and move slowly across.

"You can give yourself more buoyancy by forming air pockets in your
clothing. Tie your pants at the ankles to form air pockets in the legs. Blow
your breath inside the front opening of your collar to form air pockets over
your shoulders."

fr. *US Army Survival Manual: FM 21-76*
[repr. by Dorset Press, New York, 2002]


"Quicksand is one of the most widely publicized outdoor dander, but one
of the least understood.

"Quicksand is actually fine sand floating 'on top of and in water.' The water
is usually from a weak underground spring and is moving up with enough
pressure to keep the grains of sand suspended and moving or 'quick.' A
quagmire is similar to quicksand. It is composed of decayed material or
mud suspended by underground water.

"The first rule in either case is to remember you're basically in water and you
can 'swim' or crawl free.

"The most important rule is not to panic. Usually when you find yourself
in quicksand you've already sunk up to your waist and struggling will only
cause you to sink faster.

"Immediately throw yourself out backwards flat on the sand, arms and legs
spread as wide as possible. While you float on the sand try to gently
extricate each leg, then roll and try to swim out.

"The main thing is to prevent tiring yourself, so take your time and rest
often.

"Panic-stricken struggling only causes you to sink 'by gravity' deeper into
the mire. In trying to pull out one leg you will only force the other leg (with
all your weight) down further.

"Avoid sudden motions--take your time.

"Usually quicksand or quagmire beds are not too large so don't give up.

"Quicksand or quagmire are found all over the North American continent,
so learn to watch for them. Quicksand is most often found in areas where
water rises to the surface of the earth, for instance in stream beds and around
springs. Be especially careful in sandy soil around these areas. Quagmires
are often found around old waterholes, in muskeg country and around swamps,
marshes and tidal flats.

"If you're traveling in quicksand or quagmire country, carry a long pole and
probe the ground ahead of you."

IN THE SHADOWS OF ABU GHRAIB PRISON


One need look no further than the faces in the photos of Abu Ghraib for
the answer. When speaking recently with Emory Douglas, the celebrated
former Minister of Culture of the Black Panther Party, and chief graphic
artist of its famed newspaper, *The Black Panther*, Emory brought to
mind an image that is almost lost in history. He reminded me of a police
raid on the West Philadelphia offices of the Black Panther Party, on
August 31, 1970, when the police, armed with automatic weapons, stripped
men in the streets.



IN THE SHADOWS OF ABU GHRAIB PRISON
===================================
[Col. Writ. 5/3/04] Copyright 2004 Mumia Abu-Jamal

The color photos coming out of the dreaded Abu Ghraib
prison on Baghdad's outskirts are racing around the world,
silent yet eloquent testament to what Americans really
think about the people they allegedly came here to 'liberate.'

The photos, especially in the age of the internet, are
racing through the Arab and Muslim world, and showing a
side of the American character that seldom gets to be
seen, especially abroad.

The photos of naked Arab men, some posed with
laughing, jeering US women, is the height of humiliation,
and tells everyone who can see, that Americans hold the
Iraqis, and by extension, other Arabs, in utter contempt.

"This is not America," a politician huffs.

"I am appalled!," yet another exclaims.

Yet, what is truly appalling, and perhaps more chilling
than the naked, human pyramids shown, is the sheer glee
shown in the faces of the Americans.

The photos flashed in British tabloids, of soldiers
urinating-- pissing! -- on naked Iraqis, tells the same
baleful tale.

These are the actions of contempt, hatred, disrespect --
and conquest.

Are the Americans and the British liberators or occupiers?

One need look no further than the faces in the photos of
Abu Ghraib for the answer.

When speaking recently with Emory Douglas, the
celebrated former Minister of Culture of the Black
Panther Party, and chief graphic artist of its famed
newspaper, *The Black Panther*, Emory brought to mind
an image that is almost lost in history.

He reminded me of a police raid on the West Philadelphia
offices of the Black Panther Party, on August 31, 1970, when
the police, armed with automatic weapons, stripped men in
the streets.

I also thought of the infamous Charles Stuart case, from
Boston, when a white man claimed a Black man killed his
wife. The cops descended on Roxbury, Black Boston like
a plague. They stripped men in the streets of Beantown.

Many of the Americans working in the prisons of Iraq,
especially in the reserves, are cops or prison guards in their
civilian lives. Indeed, one of the men identified as a suspect
in the brutal mistreatment of people in Abu Ghraib, indeed a
corporal in the Army, works here, at SCI-Greene!

The horrific treatment of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib has its dark
precedents in the prisons and police stations across America.

Journalist Seymour Hersch, of *The New Yorker*
magazine, has alleged that there have been cases of sodomy
against Iraqis there at Abu Ghraib, and even killing. Does
the name Abner Louima ring a bell?

If you hate someone; if you disrespect them; if you fear
them, how can you 'liberate' them?

As we have said from the very beginning, the Iraq
Adventure is not, and never has been, about 'liberating'
an oppressed people. Indeed, a recent CNN/USA Today
poll suggests Iraqis have come to that conclusion, with 71%
stating Americans are "occupiers."

Americans may call it 'liberation,' but they are bringing
torture, humiliation, and domination.

Nor are these events the work of people who are
"untrained", "poorly trained," or the always useful,
"bad apples."

As we have suggested above, many of those who are
there in Iraq, and hundreds of the people working in Abu
Ghraib prison, were reserves, and came from jobs as
prison guards and cops in civilian life. They are perhaps
better trained than the average M.P.

Don't buy it.

It is somehow fitting that these depraved acts have
happened in one of the most dreadful gulags of the Hussein
regime; it shows the continuity of torture and terror.

Now, let us prepare for the inevitable whitewash.

Those of us who know history are certain -- it is sure
to come.

I am not sure what exactly you mean, Joel, but from a Muybridge 'motion
picture'  perspective, I will take what you say to be factually true.

It's not the completed step.
It's the step that follows.

I believe the words here are working on a "meta" interpretative level, as
well. It's never over until it's (really) over, like 'done dead.'. Didn't
Musil have a phrase similar? Don't judge a writer by what he's done, but
what follows (or some such). Process. (Or why "artificial closure" - strict
formalism - most often comes off as false & boring).

I am having trouble finishing this!

Last night I saw "Godzilla" at the Castro in SF - a new print of the
original Japanese film. Made in 1954, it's very good and goes right to the
core of the experience of nuclear terror. If you saw, "The Fog of War", the
footage of the firebombing of Japanese cities correlates quite closely with
Godzilla's images of Tokyo burning. (Remember when Gen. LeMay told McMamara
that if the USA had lost that war, the two of them would be held accountable
for war crimes.)
Of course there are those connections with the Bush Administration's
commitment to rebuild a reliance on nuclear terror and the concurrent
apprehension of a threatened regime or group's acquisition of nuclear
devices to be aimed at taking the USA out as this globe's reigning
"Godzilla."
The film's new release could not be more timely - not-withstanding the
release of those other inconvenient "pictures" !

How I read this is that to a walker, as opposed to someone who merely places
one foot in front of the other, the state of one's mind matters more than
the brand of one's shoes.

Sympathy for Lynndie England

You were never prepared for this. You never expected
it. You grew up poor, in one of the poorest parts of
the United States. You were something of a tomboy, but
a good sort of person -- you got along with folks, and
they tended to like you. You were impulsive, sometimes
-- marrying on a whim at age 18, only to divorce the
guy a year or so later -- but never nasty or vicious.
You joined the Army Reserve, mostly, because it seemed
to offer money and opportunities you couldn't get any
other way. You hoped it would allow you to save up for
college, and give you some of the skills you'd need in
order to get in.
But you never expected you'd be called up to active
duty, and sent to Iraq: a country far away, hotter
than Hell, and filled with people who we were supposed
to have freed from tyranny: you were told that these
people would love you, but it seemed that they mostly
resented you, in a sullen sort of way; aside, that is,
from the ones who actively hated you and tried to kill
you.
You were trained as much to be a bureaucrat as a
soldier: your job was to sit behind a desk and process
the papers of Iraqi detainees. But once you were
actually working at the Abu Ghraib prison, you found
that a lot more was expected of you.
The higher-ups (both military officers whom you were
supposed to obey, and private "contractors" who you
were told you should also obey) wanted "information"
from the detainees, and they wanted you to help them
get it. There were various interrogation techniques
they taught you: depriving the prisoners of sleep,
stripping them naked and humiliating them sexually,
putting hoods over their heads and subjecting them to
mild electric shocks; and of course, threatening them
with physical violence, and sometimes carrying through
on the threats, for the sake of credibility.
It was weird at first; you had never, in your wildest
dreams, imagined doing these sorts of things to
anyone. But these prisoners really hated and resented
you; you knew they'd kill you if they could, if the
positions were reversed. So it wasn't that hard to
think of them as less than human; especially since
your superiors encouraged you to think this way,
encouraged you to be relentless, not to let the
fuckers get away with anything, pry their secrets
loose from them before more Americans, more of your
buddies, were killed. And when you did your part in
the interrogations, when you finally got one of the
prisoners to break, to lose his defiance, to tell the
"contractors" everything he knew, your superiors
praised you for a job well done.
And after a while, you even started to enjoy it; it
wasn't the power, exactly, so much as a kind of
recognition from your peers: an esprit de corps that
kept you going, when you were cut off from home and
family; and an acceptance as one of the guys, which
was something you had always wanted, proving yourself
as their equal even though they originally looked down
on you because you were a girl. In a funny way, it was
also something that brought you and your boyfriend
together more: not that you got off on what you were
doing, exactly, but it was a kind of complicity, and a
way in which the two of you could feel that you were
triumphant, standing together against -- and in spite
of -- everything else, and everyone else in the world.

And it must have been in one of those moments that
your boyfriend took those photos: of you grinning and
giving thumbs up, and pointing at the genitalia of a
naked, abject prisoner; or of you grinning and holding
one of those poor fuckers by a leash, as if he were a
disobedient dog.
And now those pictures have been published, and you
are the most infamous woman in the world; and they're
going to throw the book at you, and basically you have
no future and no hope. But of course somebody has to
take the fall; and of course it will never be the
people who imagined it, who organized it, who trained
you in it, who told you to do it, and whose dreams of
conquering and looting the world you were never really
privy to. They can't be blamed, so it has to be
somebody like you, who was poor and without prospects
to begin with. No matter how deeply you felt that
esprit de corps, you never were a member of that
elite, and you never would be; you were expendable
from the beginning, and your life is the price our
rulers are happily willing to pay, as they pursue
their program of conquest and domination.

And to add:

And when the latest oppression became too much,
to quickly get pregnant, a method of "escape" learned
in your hometown by so many others like you so many
cycles before. Only, you were too naive, believing
a leniency would be extended. You will give birth in a prison.
The child will be taken away. The rulers who used you
like toilets paper don't care.

Why not stop in at The Personified Third and leave a
chestnut in the unsung Haloscanner? (Recent items:
excerpts from various projects, some pre-situ
(Lettrist) nuggets from Guy Debord--"To Have Done With
the Comforts of Nihilism--and Alfred North Whitehead
and Gertrude Stein speak from the beyond).


. . .  Even when we are beaten we see ourselves
getting beaten. But this is nitpicking. . .

Salt Publishing is pleased to announce the publication of Elegies and
Vacations by Hank Lazer.


About the book: A book of intense emotional power, ‘Elegies &
Vacations’ marks Hank Lazer’s taking the resources of innovative
poetry in new directions that are at once elegiac, skeptical, and
spiritual.  Eleven poems, no two alike, ‘Elegies & Vacations’ is an
ambitious attempt, in the words of Robert Duncan, “to recreate the
heart of poetry itself.”  Linking elegies to extended journal-like
meditations, ‘Elegies & Vacations’ asks “what the day may mean.”  At
the heart of the book is a long poem, “Deathwatch for My Father,”
which tracks the poet’s father’s final months, testing out the
capacities of innovative poetry in the face of the death of a loved
one.  The book explores relationships with the dead—from the poet’s
father, to John Cage, to Kenneth Burke, to George Oppen—while also,
through family vacations, projecting forward to ask “to what are we
ancestral.”  The opposed or apposed guiding lights
of the book—John Ashbery and George Oppen—like the juxtaposed elegies
and vacations, offer divergent modes of verbal and ethical grace.
Informed by a Buddhist sensibility, as well as by the relativistic
thinking of reform (and mystical) Judaism, Lazer’s poems move through
varying terrains of form, textuality, and geography, from Suzhou
(China) to the Abacos (the Bahamas), from Diamond Head (Oahu) to Orono
(Maine), from an extended portrait to a journal, from children’s
stories to a two-columned composition on the nature of literary
history.

About the author: Elegies & Vacations, Hank Lazer’s eleventh book of
poetry, is Lazer’s fourth large collection of poetry, following Days
(Lavender Ink, 2002), 3 of 10 (Chax Press, 1996), and Doublespace:
Poems 1971-1989 (Segue, 1992). A noted critic, Lazer’s two-volume
Opposing Poetries (Northwestern University Press) appeared in 1996.
With Charles Bernstein, Lazer edits the Modern and Contemporary
Poetics Series for the University of Alabama, where Lazer is Assistant
Vice President and Professor of English.

Wow!

(from The Independent - London)


Poll shows majority want UK troops to pull out

By Nigel Morris

10 May 2004


Independent/MOP poll
Should British troops pull out of Iraq by 30th June?
55 per cent: YES
28 per cent: NO
17 per cent: DON'T KNOW

Voters support the withdrawal of all British troops from Iraq by the end of
next month by a majority of two to one, a poll for The Independent reveals
today.

With ministers considering sending more soldiers to Iraq to quell the
insurrection against Allied forces, the survey reflects growing public
discontent about government policy on the war and occupation.

The poll comes at a turbulent time for the Government, rocked by allegations
over the mistreatment of Iraqi captives. Yesterday, in a further
embarrassment for Britain and America, it emerged that their ambassadors to
Switzerland had been summoned by the Swiss government to demand respect for
international law in the treatment of prisoners in Iraq.

Acting as the guardian of the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of warfare,
the Swiss Foreign Minister, Micheline Calmy-Rey, said she felt "abhorrence
and rage" over the disclosures of prisoner abuse.

She told the SonntagsBlick weekly: "It violates international humanitarian
law. I am very concerned. These are occurrences that we cannot keep silent
about."

Hockey hazing, Iraqi style

By LAURA ROBINSON
Laura Robinson, former national-level skier and cyclist, is author of
Crossing the Line: Violence and Sexual Assault in Canada's National Sport
(1998) and, most recently, Black Tights: Women, Sport and Sexuality.

UPDATED AT 12:19 PM EDT  Monday, May. 10, 2004

There is nothing surprising about the charges of prisoner abuse by
American soldiers in Iraq given the hyper-masculine culture of the U.S.
military.

In fact, abuse is predictable in any group that defines masculinity
through power, strength and aggression. That female soldiers took part is
also predictable. To prove they are "one of the boys" in this subculture,
women must push the envelope of disgust further than the men would.

The brutal sadomasochistic acts themselves are hardly original. They are
strongly reminiscent of the initiation rites some soldiers themselves
report taking place at the start of their military service.

The truth is, they also bear a striking resemblance to what junior and NHL
hockey players have told me formed part of their own initiations in
playing hockey in this country.

The photo released this week of stripped prisoners who had been forced to
pile on top of one another as if they were having oral sex shocked most
people.

But it reminded me of the dozens of junior hockey players who told me
about something they all called the sweatbox. This is the tiny washroom at
the back of the bus in which the teams travel. On many teams, it was
required for all rookies, at one time or another, to be stripped and
forced into the sweatbox, only to be taken out one at a time for more
abuse.

One player, who went on to play in the NHL, told me rookies sometimes had
to walk down the aisle of the bus naked, with their hands behind their
heads, while senior players could use any object they wanted -- cassette
cases, coat hangers, whatever -- to beat their genitals.

He said he was a pretty quiet guy, and wasn't beaten badly, but one
player, who was considered rather mouthy, was beaten until he bled. All
the while, the coach sat at the front of the bus and laughed. That coach
is now in the NHL.

Reading of Iraqi prisoners being sodomized with a chemical light stick or
a broomstick reminded me of the countless numbers of junior players who
told me about the favourite instruments in hockey for sodomizing: a tube
of liniment or a hockey stick.

The similarity between military hazing and hockey initiation became clear
to me when I was researching Crossing the Line. It continues to be
supported by further testimony.

At a recent conference on sport, three men described the abuse they had
encountered in the U.S. military. Another disclosed the abuse he suffered
in junior hockey.

There was little difference.

The former hockey player added that his son, who played on a U.S. hockey
scholarship, dealt with the risk of being abused by taking steroids to
become one of the biggest and, he hoped, most feared players on his team.

For me, junior or NHL hockey teams and military units long ago became
interchangeable. The behaviour both exhibit is the logical progression of
an ideology that equates real men with violence. If women want to be real
men, they have to do it, too, and the violence will ultimately turn sexual
because of the gendered nature of defining power through masculinity in
the first place.

No one likes to talk about the brutal hazing that young soldiers endure,
nor about the macho attitudes that gave rise to the abuse of Iraqi
prisoners. Certainly, few people have bothered to investigate the
connection.

Unfortunately, I found the same thing in Canadian hockey. Deeply
entrenched and sick behaviour has gone unchallenged and uninvestigated for
years.

It may be reassuring for Canadians to know that our national symbol is a
hockey player and not a soldier, but whether a human being is a first-year
junior player or a prisoner of war, there is little difference between
hockey sticks and broomsticks.

"As much as a collection of translations of poems and essays, this book
is a
translation of a language. Due to the fortuitous convergence of
historical,
linguistic and geographic factors, in the 20th century -from the
creation of the
Turkish Republic in the 1920's to the 1990's when
Istanbul/Constantinople/Byzantium turned from a jewel-like city of
contrasts of under a million to a city
of twelve million- Turkey created a body of poetry unique in the 20th
century, with its own poetics, world view and idiosyncratic sensibility.
What is more
these qualities are intimately related to the nature of Turkish as a
language
-its strengths and its defining limits. As historical changes occurred,
the
language in this poetry responded to them, flowered, changed; but always
remaining a continuum, a psychic essence, a dialectic which is an
arabesque. It is
this silent melody of the mind -the cadence of its total allure- which
this
collection tries to translate. While every effort has been made to
create the
individual music of each poem and poet, none can really be understood
without
responding to the movement running through them, through Turkish in the
20th
century. I call this essence eda, each poet, poem being a specific case
of eda,
unique stations in the progress of the Turkish soul, language. " Murat
Nemet-Nejat

Stripping Other People And Leading Them Around On A Leash."
by Ben Gray


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

San Francisco

415.221.4272

a reading by

Lisa Jarnot and Brandon Brown

Lisa Jarnot's third collection, Black Dog Songs,
is new from Flood Editions. Stan Brakhage writes:
"However adrift in linguistic aesthetics, in sheer
music-of-rhythmed-sounds, her words are never
severed from the means that engendered them; and
the consequent meanings are never detached from
the meditative drama of each whole poem." Jarnot
visits from NYC (she also reads May 14 at Small
Press Traffic); her previous works are Some Other
Kind of Mission and Ring of Fire. Her critical
biography of Robert Duncan will be published by UC
Press next year.

Brandon Brown is a poet and translator from Kansas
City, Missouri. He is currently an MFA candidate
at San Francisco State University. His poems have
appeared. He lives in San Francisco with one
chainsmoking maniac.

Directions:

Public trans: From downtown San Francisco, take
the 38 Geary or the 31 Balboa, and get off at 35th
Ave. Driving: drive to 35th and Balboa, park; my
building is the big one on the northwest corner of
the street. Ring the buzzer for apartment 204.

======================================================


Catherine Daly attended college in Hartford and graduate school in New York,
where she lived on every street from 116th to110th, then moved skip stops
down the upper west side. She has worked as a technical architect and an
engineer supporting the space shuttle orbiter, and has consulted to
investment banks on, among other things, disaster recovery. This,
unfortunately, impacts her poetry, which moves beyond the telephone to
wireless in the giant book DaDaDa (Salt Publishing, 2003) and the
forthcoming love poems, Locket (Tupelo Press, 2004). She lives in Los
Angeles.

Chris Piuma has edited the online quasi-literary journal flim (flim.com) for
many years. His band, the Minor Thirds, played a show in Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan not long ago. He has been published in assorted venues, the
likes of which you won't soon find elsewhere. He has bought board games in
moonlit park entrances from dealers in nondescript green cars. There might
be new books and recordings of his poetry.

The Old City
============

Where are the fourteen-year-old girls of my youth?
Where are my chariots of desire?
Why can't I drink all the Kool-Aid in the house?
Who put this here?

Why did I do that?
When did all these ants start crawling about here?
Who did you give the money to?

What was I going to tell you?
Where were you last night?
What should I have told that reporter, then?
Who knows what would make you happy.

Why did I do all that?
When did all these ants learn to make money at home?
Who did you crawl off with?

Books I like and highly recommend!


The following are books I've read or am currently reading, mostly the
former. They're wonderful and I think are definitely worth your attention.


Two books that bear comparison, both from Salt

Catherine Daly, DaDaDa and
Loss Pequeno Glazier, Anatman, Pumpkin Seed, Algorithm

These are first of all both beautiful books. And they work through
technology and technologies in odd ways, ways that configure the
integration of the technological into body and poetic discourse, as if
spectral communications were phantom limbs or tendrils extending from
desktops and PDAs , within and without. Glazier works out of an
incredible, intense, Mexican and Cuban (for the most part) matrix, which
becomes himself as well. His is an 'important' book within emerging
discourses of real and virtual continents. And Daly's work as well, with
its internal technologies, technologies as breathing, or as electric
Marguerite, mythos, scaled histories. I really recommend these books
highly; I found them inspiring and turning language towards infinities
both electronic and intensely real.

>From Raw Nerve Books

Sue Thomas, Hello World, travels in virtuality

This is an odd work, a mix of real and imaginary journeys, discoursing on
psychogeography, Bachelard, and a broad-based view of the Net along the
way. As a mix it's intense and entrancing, and it's demonstrates the ease
with which computers, electronic communications, and lives all intertwine
beyond the home. This isn't the typical mobile technology journey, but a
journey of integration, and it's as such that I highly recommend it. My
only concern - and I have no answer for this - how much, today, should one
describe the Net and its communications systems? As Katherine Hayles
points out on the back cover, the book is 'Highly recommended for first-
time users and those who want to try dipping their toes into the
cyberwaters.' But for those of us who are familiar with the technologies,
the value is elsewhere - following this journey, and Thomas's lived and
interpenetrated spaces, across the world. There is an associated website
by the way, http://www.travelsinvirtuality.com . (This is by the way a
work I wish I could have written, but my own journeys have seemed too
monstrous and tangled, too compressed. There's a sense of space in
Thomas's book that's both open and comforting.)

>From Atelos

Brian Kim Stefans, Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics, which _is_ more
or less digital poetics itself. I love dipping into this work. There's a
huge gap between it and Richards' Practical Criticism, but I like them
both for their caress of writing, and _fascination_ with their target
texts, reproduced among themselves, authorships in question. The Scotch is
there in Stefans' work, for example, both real and imaginary. There are
numerous sidebars and footnotes as well; the text skitters. This is simply
a wonderful book.

>From Minnesota comes

Anne Weinstone, Avatar Bodies, A Tantra for Posthumanism. I have diffi-
culty at this point with theoretical posthumanist texts that discourse on
desire; on the other hand, I'm fascinated by the relationships Weinstone
draws or breathes with Tantra; it's this which holds me. I don't feel
capable of commenting on the text itself at this point, except to note the
pleasure it gives, as well as assumptions about multiple selves,
virtualities, and our selves avatars. It reminds me of Lingis' work - and
in general where is Lingis in cyber discourse? But then I'm ignorant. -
I do want to stree that I am reading and rereading sections of this work,
scurrying across it, another skittering, and I find the text amazing in
this regard.

>From O'Reilly

One more technology book, which I immediately applied and have been using
furiously - Preston Gralla, Windows XP Hacks, part of the Hacking series.
This book is simply great - I've applied at least 20-30 of the hacks to my
own (video/audio/blender/text) laptop system. I've used other WinXP books
to good effect, but this one in particular has been extremely useful. I
couldn't have done http://www.asondheim.org/node.mp3 without it.

Some older books if you find them -

Kossovo, Heroic Songs of the Serbs, translated by Helen Rootham (with the
original texts), Houghton Mifflin Company, 1920. This volume focuses on
the battle of Kossovo 1389, and the starkness and repetitiveness of the
songs have parallels of course with Yugoslavian epics, Homer, etc. These
are intense pieces, some of them fragments, and they've already entered my
dreams. The only problem with the book is its shortness.

Serge Gavronsky, Toward a new Poetics, Contemporary Writing in France,
consists of interviews of texts; it's from 1994, and I should have known
the work! Authors include Deguy, Gugliemi, Hocquard, even Pleynet. (The
last's book on painting is incredible by the way.) Get it if you can.
Enough said.

In Bhargava's Dictionary, Anglo-Hindi, the definitions are in both English
and Hindi, and this is one of the most wonderful sources of words I've
come across; the definitions are often beautiful. My edition is the 12th
from 1966, and I've been using it regularly. Extersion, act of wiping or
rubbing. Tortive, twisted. Airmanship, the art of handling an airship.
Gothamite, a great fool.

Legge's I Ching - I like this for the endless notes and clarity of the
appendices; it's not as poetic as the Wilhelm, but I'm not using the work
for divination or poetry. Dover edition. There's a small paperback
(Mentor, 1971) edition of the book rearranged with the hexagram names and
other minor changes, edited by Raymond van Over; I recommend this as well,
especially for clarity.

Burton Watson, Records of the Historian, Chapters from the Shih Chi of
Ssu-ma Ch'ien, California, and Sima Qian, Historical Records, translated
by Dawson, Oxford World's Classic. I can't get enough of this work; the
Dawson edition shows why. There are parallels between the Qin and Bush
dynasties that are unnerving; hopefully both will last an equally short
amount of time.

Finally I'm reading the full version of The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon,
translated and edited by Ivan Morris in two volumes (one text, one notes),
published in 1967. It's quite different, in fact, due in part to the
sections of lists, and I much prefer it. I haven't seen this reissued, but
if you have a chance at all, find and read it (i.e. in preference to the
Penguin edition).

***
From Homemade/Handmade Poems by Lorine Niedecker

And "downstream" it is, these prisons, ("Iraq")
This practice of torture, an American "divined" policy,
dogs in mid-bite, caught in the act,
The soul of the country "caught in the act" -
An ideology, "democracy, beacon of light",
Its head "blown off", "caught in the act" ,
A top down, uniform policy,
 "loosen, soften them up"
There are no "innocent bystanders,"
"teeth marks and bleeding"
We are not, "spring and all",
This horrible shit, sunk into it, way bad -
Johnny and Jane
Better come marching home,
Whimpering:
Time, very much the time, to take the teeth
Promptly out: Wofolitz, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Feith, Perle, Bush
Time, imperative: pull them, take them quickly:
They are all extraordinarily dangerous, criminal.
Take them, throw them, as fast as possible,
All the way out. There is no, absolutely no credibility
(moral or otherwise, if there ever was) for us, "head/
Blown off"  to remain, do anything, in or for, Iraq.

i.e. Read, if you haven't, all the prison articles, Red Cross reports, etc.,
sign all those petitions to remove x, y & z, and call Senators and
Congressperson "to heed the call."

FEATURING:

SEAN MEEHAN- New York (percussion) & JOHN DIERKER - Baltimore (horns/reeds)
ROD SMITH- DC (words)

The evening will begin with collaborations by Baltimore writers.

SEAN MEEHAN: Sean Meehan became musically active in the late 80's at the
Amica Bunker Series for improvised music which was then housed at ABC No Rio
in New York City. Current performances generally find Meehan playing only
the snare drum in a manner that sheds conventional usage and reconstructs
the conception and function of the instrument. Concert activities, both at
home and away, are generally divided between playing in conventional
settings for experimental music and in seeking out unique locations that are
often in the unwatched and unconsidered corners of the city. Meehan's
recordings document some of his collaborations including work with Sachiko
M; Mamoru Fujieda and Michihiro Sato; Edwin Torres and Miguel Algarin; and
Tamio Shiraishi.


JOHN DIERKER: Since the mid-eighties JOHN DIERKER has been forging new
ground from his hometown Baltimore, MD. A highly versatile musician who
plays with equal inspiration in the most extreme avant-garde, R & B, jazz,
and rock music. Some of Dierker's current projects included, Lafayette
Gilchrist and the New Volcanoes, and ilculo. He can be heard on a large
number of recordings on Megaphone, Generate Records, and Mass Particles.
Dierker has worked with a diverse group of musicians including, Vattel
Cherry, John Hughes, Paul Hoskin, Sean Meehan, Toshi Makihara, Bob Wagner,
and Jason Willett.


ROD SMITH: Rod Smith was born in Gallipolis, Ohio in 1962 and grew up in
Northern Virginia where he attended Stonewall Jackson High School. His first
publication of poetry was a Ferlinghetti imitation in the Baltimore Sun in
1982. In the early 80s Smith was a rural carrier for the US Postal Service
in the vicinity of the Manassas Battlefield, during which time he studied
Pound, Stein, Williams, Ashbery, O'Hara, Oppen, and others. He began the
journal Aerial with Wayne Kline in 1984 and published the first Edge Book in
1989. He moved to DC in 1987 and became part of the DC poetry community. He
currently manages Bridge Street Books in DC and presents a monthly reading
series. Previous readers include: Bruce Andrews, Rae Armantrout, Anselm
Berrigan, Lee Ann Brown, Norma Cole, Tim Davis, Peter Gizzi, Carla Harryman,
Lyn Hejinian, Lisa Jarnot, Melanie Neilson, Alice Notley, Lisa Robertson,
David Shapiro, Juliana Spahr, Edwin Torres, and Rosmarie Waldrop.

Remember those dark days
in which love lay coiled

along the coccyx, and your only
instrument was a sex not

nutritious, but pensive, padding
along the walls of your room

like the vampire desire becomes?
However diligent the drug,
the properties of thaw
remain unchanged, and you get

hot flashes slipping such long hair
to earth that earth is covered, so
don't even think about it: relax.

Forget all the bullshit associations
intrinsic to your relations. I

scream every summer, watching
wasps build nests in all your corners.

frank and curious way, always dwelling, always
opening." - Erin Moure

WORKSHOPS

ANNOUNCING A SUMMER WORKSHOP WITH POET JORGE GUITART

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

Stephen Vincent sent a note asking about younger poets in Boston. There's a
slew of them. Can't say I know everyone, and I'm leaving out some perpetual
kids like Garrit Lansing, but here goes. Depending on your cut-off for
"young," you might start with senior youth, Daniel Bouchard who co-edits
"The Poker" and Jimmy Behrle who is perhaps a little more famous than others
thanks to his NPR stints, fantastic curating at Wordsworth Books and
prodigious blogging. Add their buddies Mark Lamoureux and Mike County --
both have had a couple of books released this last year -- and Sean Cole
whose "Itty City" has just been published. Tim Peterson has lived in Boston
for more than four seasons, so we can call him a townie now; his "Cumulus"
came out last year, from Portable Press, and ranks as one of the most
benignly caustic set of lyrics I've read in some time. Lamoureux and
Peterson appear in the now-definitive young Bostonian "Sunday Morning
Anthology," whose 'design and such' is by Christina Strong, a major writer
on the scene, I think, who knows better than anyone else here how to merge
Wieners with viz poetics for haut politics and raging verse. Among others in
the anthology (available by contacting chrisx@xtina.org) Michael Carr and
Chris Rizzo, as well as Gloucesterites Amanda Cook and James Cook. Still
north of Boston in the Gloucester area you'll find the still-teeming Jim
Dunn and Patrick Dowd and I'm sure a few others slaving at their craft. The
Cooks, Rizzo, Strong, Peterson, Lamoureux, County and of course Behrle have
their own blogs, and you can find out more about the B-scene by tuning in
there (listings available at the Poetics EPC site or on sidebars of numerous
poet-blogs, including my pantaloons.blogspot.com). Other young poet bloggers
from Boston: Michaela Cooper, Shin Yu Pai, Lauren Kreuger, Aaron Tieger.
Tieger is moving out of town, though, as has Yuri Hospodar -- big shortfall.
Carl Annarummo has got to be the sliest poet-blogger ever, and he's leaving
Boston this month. Another incalculable loss. But great to welcome Tina
Celona to town. I'm sure there are many others to name and welcome.

What bothers me most is the American Media. Watching the evening news, even
a NYT reporter speaking from Baghdad I know is not reporting what's really
happening. Not that he's lying, but that his American mindset can't see,
can't admit to what his countrymen- and women are doing, as this would make
him guilty too.
An example is when Iraqis are interviewed, or polled, while not realizing,
or wanting too, that many Iraqi People are afraid to tell an American what
they really think, for the same reason they were afraid to tell Saddam's
people. Prison and torture. Their hatred for Americans, and for other
Westerners in their country uninvited, especially those civilian vultures
who are there to profit from the tragedy, must boil over when they speak
amongst themselves.

Well, in their elementary school classrooms with the US flag and the

You may have disapproved of my "extremist" views over the last year.
Now, with each passing day, most of my dire predictions are coming true.
We are living in an ever deepening spiral of political and moral
disaster. Only NOW is the media and press beginning to report on the
crisis of liberty and justice, the severity of our situation as a
nation. As we head into the fall election either one of two things will
happen. There will be peaceful regime change in America, or there will
be tyranny on a scale our nation has never endured. Thus we will
continue to fight for peaceful regime change. Let us not be fooled, this
is a difficult and dangerous operation. Our mission as patriots of the
constitution must not be swayed by the overwhelming strong arm tactics
of right wing fascists and propaganda. We have shaken the grip of their
illusion. We have them on the defensive. We must remain united in our
grass roots organizations, for when "we the people" stand together, we
form a civilian solidarity and resistance that mere tyrants cannot shake.

Bush Fails History...Jefferson Predicted Iraq
by Thom Hartmann

Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon thought they could bomb Vietnam into
accepting democracy. George W. Bush thinks he can do it with Iraq.

But the first American president to consider how best to grow
democracies - Thomas Jefferson - had some very different thoughts on the
issue. LBJ and Bush would have done well to listen to his thoughtful
words in a letter he wrote on February 14, 1815, to his old friend in
France, the Marquis de Lafayette.

Discussing the French Revolution, the Terror that followed, and the
reign of Napoleon, Jefferson noted that building democracy is an organic
process: The democracy movement in the colonies had been fermenting for
a century prior to Jefferson's birth.

"A full measure of liberty is not now perhaps to be expected by your
nation," Jefferson wrote, about the democracy movement within France,
"nor am I confident they are prepared to preserve it. More than a
generation will be requisite, under the administration of reasonable
laws favoring the progress of knowledge in the general mass of the
people, and their habituation to an independent security of person and
property, before they will be capable of estimating the value of
freedom, and the necessity of a sacred adherence to the principles on
which it rests for preservation."

He added that it's nearly impossible to force democracy on a people, and
the consequences of trying could be disastrous. "Instead of that liberty
which takes root and growth in the progress of reason, if recovered by
mere force or accident, it becomes, with an unprepared people, a tyranny
still, of the many, the few, or the one."

Lafayette, at the time of the French Revolution (1789), had expressed
his concerns to Jefferson that the movement for democracy wasn't
sufficiently widespread among the average people in France to take hold
as it had in America, and they should thus make the transition via a
constitutional monarchy much like today's United Kingdom. At the time,
Jefferson had disagreed with his friend, but in this 1815 letter, he
noted: "And I found you were right.... Unfortunately, some of the most
honest and enlightened of our patriotic friends...did not weigh the
hazards of a transition from one form of government to another."

Many in the revolutionary movement of France of that era opposed
Lafayette's deliberate and careful push for an organic democracy, rather
than a sudden lurch. "You differed from them," Jefferson noted. "You
were for stopping there, and for securing the Constitution which the
National Assembly had obtained. Here, too, you were right; and from this
fatal error of the republicans, from their separation from yourself and
the constitutionalists, in their councils, flowed all the subsequent
sufferings and crimes of the French nation."

The lack of a truly widespread, average-citizen-based movement for
democracy in France, Lafayette had privately argued to Jefferson two
decades earlier, could simply lead to a transition from the tyranny of
the king to another, perhaps worse, form of tyranny. While Jefferson
had, at first, embraced the French revolution, in his letter to
Lafayette he confessed that he had now come to agree that without a
broader base of support, a sudden change of government was a disaster,
and the primary beneficiaries would only be war profiteers and the rich,
Frenchmen who were so opposed to democracy that they could even be
called foreigners.

Thus, Jefferson wrote, "The foreigner gained time to anarchize by gold
the government he could not overthrow by arms, to crush in their own
councils the genuine republicans... and to turn the machine of
Jacobinism from the change to the destruction of order; and, in the end,
the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged for the unprincipled
and bloody tyranny of Robespierre, and the equally unprincipled and
maniac tyranny of Bonaparte."

Comparing France to America, Jefferson noted how - unlike France - we
had overthrown an external occupier all by ourselves. For American
colonists, the repression and occupation of the English in the Colonies
"has helped rather than hurt us, by arousing the general indignation of
our country, and by marking to the world of Europe the vandalism and
brutal character of the English government. It has merely served to
immortalize their infamy."

And now Arab leaders like Egypt's Mubarak say that, across the Arab
world, our infamy is being immortalized by Bush's unprovoked invasion
and occupation of oil-rich Iraq. America, Mubarak says, faces "a hatred
never equaled" in the Middle East, even as Iraq totters on the edge of
civil war.

It's as if the cycles of history are repeating themselves, and Iraq may
now suffer the Terrors that racked France in the 19th Century.

When John Adams wrote to Jefferson on July 13, 1813 about a French
politician, he could just as easily have been speaking of George W.
Bush: "In plain truth, I was astonished at the grossness of his
ignorance of government and history."

Adams added, speaking of those who think they can create empire and have
a stable rule purely by military force, "Napoleon has lately invented a
word which perfectly expresses my opinion, at that time and ever since.
He calls the project Ideology; and... it was all madness."

But like Iraq with Saddam, Jefferson wrote that true democracy would
take time in France because the overthrow of a tyrant had been done so
hastily. "You are now rid of him, and I sincerely wish you may continue
so. But this may depend on the wisdom and moderation of the restored
dynasty. It is for them now to read a lesson in the fatal errors of the
republicans; to be contented with a certain portion of power, secured by
formal compact with the nation, rather than, grasping at more, hazard
all upon uncertainty, and risk meeting the fate of their predecessor...."

As we "hazard all upon uncertainty" in the Middle East, Iraq is proving
the prescience of our greatest presidents yet again. As Franklin D.
Roosevelt said on September 22, 1936, "In the truest sense, freedom
cannot be bestowed, it must be achieved."

If only George W. Bush had paid attention during his study of history at
Yale...

First Nations protest celebration of genocide
By Mahtowin, Workers World,
10 July 1997
As Canada celebrated the 500th anniversary of the discovery of
Newfoundland and Labrador, Native protesters came out to demand justice
and to commemorate the genocide of Indigenous peoples.

First Nations demonstrators trailed Queen Elizabeth II of England
throughout her tour of Canada. The queen had traveled to Canada to be part
of Cabot 500, a multi- million-dollar celebration of the Italian mercenary
sailor John Cabot's voyage to Newfoundland. Cabot arrived there in his
ship, the Matthew, on June 24, 1497.

Columbus' Caribbean landfall in 1492 marked the beginning of the Spanish
and Portuguese invasion of the Americas. In British and Canadian history,
Cabot's 1497 voyage is considered more significant, because it signaled
the beginning of the British and French assault on the land and Indigenous
peoples of North America.

Born Giovanni Caboto, Cabot was sponsored by the English King Henry VII.
Henry empowered Cabot and other mercenary sailors to search out
territories of heathen and infidels and to enter and seize them ... to
occupy, possess and subdue [them] ... as our vassals.

Explorer John Cabot's landing, the queen said in a speech, represents the
geographical and intellectual beginning of modern North America.

What the queen did not say was that, less than 350 years after her pirates
and thieves invaded the sovereign Beothuk territories in Newfoundland, the
Beothuk nation had been exterminated. Shanawdathit, the last of her
nation, died of tuberculosis in 1829.

The other Indigenous populations in Newfoundland and Labrador have come
perilously close to extinction since the European arrival.

Innu leader Katie Riche said: I see nothing to celebrate. Along the way a
whole nation, the Beothuks, were wiped out. We don't want that to happen
to us.

Newfoundland and Labrador First Nations people had been invited to
participate in the Cabot quincentenary. They declined.

[The First Nations of] Newfoundland and Labrador are still waiting to be
`discovered' by the federal government, said a Native spokesperson earlier
this year.

Many Native people thought the millions of dollars poured into the Cabot
festival would be better spent settling land claims or taking care of
human needs.

Some of the First Nations protesters asked that the queen intervene on
their behalf with the government of Canada.

On June 26, two 6-year-old Innu children gave the queen a written message
from the Innu People of Nitassinan--Labrador and Quebec--which read in
part:

The history of colonization here has been lamentable and has severely
demoralized our People. They turn now to drink and self-destruction. We
have the highest rate of suicide in North America. Children as young as 12
have taken their own life recently. We feel powerless to prevent the
massive mining projects now planned. ...

The Labrador part of Nitassinan was claimed as British soil until very
recently (1949), when, without consulting us, your government ceded it to
Canada. We have never, however, signed any treaty with either Great
Britain or Canada. Nor have we ever given up our right to self-
determination.

The fact that we have become financially dependent on the state which
violates our rights is a reflection of our desperate circumstances. It
does not mean that we acquiesce in those violations.

We have been treated as non-People, with no more rights than the caribou
on which we depend and which are now themselves being threatened by NATO
war exercises and other so-called `development.' In spite of this, we
remain a People in the fullest sense of the word. We have not given up.
...

We have many friends in Great Britain where thousands of ordinary people
have spent many years supporting our rights. We would like to count you,
Your Majesty, as one of those friends.

Unsurprisingly, Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, one of the
wealthiest people on the planet and the titular head of the British
Commonwealth, was neither moved nor amused by this Innu request for
assistance.

into an exorcism, into the fan's

Hi Alan: Is Joanna your daughter? (or wife?)  I knew your daughter some whe=
n
she worked Phoenix Books, one of my local bookshops. Say hello to her for
me. And,if you well, my blog address - in case she is homesick for work wit=
h
locally familiar materials.

What did Reznikoff, Blackburn and WCW do to me, and, well now, Niedecker?

Be well and have fun at the reading,

It seems Bill Clinton's autobiography is called My
Life. Think he'll take some cues from Lyn Hejinian?

Beat Thing is David Meltzer's truly epic poem - an engagement with =
history & his own participatory & witnessing presence. If the title at =
first suggests a nostalgic romp through a 1950s-style beat scene, it =
doesn't take long before mid-twentieth-century America's urban =
pastoralism comes apart in all its phases & merges with the final =
solutions of death camps & death bombs from the preceding decade. This =
is collage raised to a higher power - a tough-grained & meticulously =
detailed poetry - "without check with original energy," as Whitman wrote =
- & very much what's needed now.
- Jerome Rothenberg=20

The Beat Thing sizzles as close as yesterday-with landmarks, names, =
occasions-as Poet Meltzer writes us back into the beat. Everyone's still =
There. As fresh as ever.
- Joanne Kyger

David Meltzer has gifted us with his beautifully written kabalistic and =
unique look at the Beat Generation. He also turns his eye to the =
American infrastructure of Bebop. This book comes out of his mature =
consciousness like energy spray bursting from the brow of a dolphin.
- Michael McClure

David Meltzer's most important lyri-political work. A profound =
juxtaposition in which the Beat Movement's meaning is resonated with the =
haunting of the Holocaust and the American years of McCarthyism and Jim =
Crowism. Like all great works, this entire book is single simultaneous =
moment in progress, written by a poet who - in terms of the rhythms, =
verbal inventiveness and the naming of figures of popular culture - is =
without equal anywhere.
- Jack Hirschman

David Meltzer is one of the secret treasures on our planet. Great poet, =
musician, comic; mystic unsurpassed, performer with few peers. His "ear" =
like we used to say and his erudition are fine-tuned and precise. A kind =
of bop-perfection pervades this work.
-Diane di Prima


"how easily narrative falls into place, realizes itself through a =
story-telling historian who sets out to frame a tangled constantly =
permutating chaos into a familiar & repeatable story w/out shadows or =
dead-ends; how impulsively memory organizes into a choir to tell a story =
of what it remembers symphonically, i.e., formally; even =
experimentalists practice w/in or against forms that have formed their =
relationship to writing & telling stories; history is the story of =
writing"=20

-Epilogue from Beat Thing


David Meltzer is the author of many volumes of poetry, including The =
Clown (Semina, 1960), The Process (Oyez, l965), Yesod (Trigram, l969), =
Arrows: Selected Poetry, 1957-1992 (Black Sparrow Press, 1994), and No =
Eyes: Lester Young (Black Sparrow, 2000). He has also published fiction, =
including The Agency Trilogy (Brandon House, l968; reprinted by Richard =
Kasak, 1994), Orf (Brandon House, l969; reprinted by Masquerade Books, =
l995), Under (Rhinoceros Books, 1997), and book-length essays, including =
Two-Way Mirror: A Poetry Notebook (Oyez, 1977). He has edited numerous =
anthologies and collections of interviews, including The Secret Garden: =
An Anthology in the Kabbalah (Continuum Press, 1976; reprinted, Station =
Hill Press, 1998), Birth: Anthology of Ancients Texts, Songs, Prayers, =
and Stories (North Point Press, 1981), Death: Anthology of Texts, Songs, =
Charms, Prayers, and Tales (North Point Press, 1984), Reading Jazz =
(Mercury House, 1996), Writing Jazz (Mercury House, 1999), and San =
Francisco Beat: Talking With the Poets (City Lights, 2001). His musical =
recordings include Serpent Power (Vanguard Records, l968; reissued on CD =
in 1996) and Poet Song (Vanguard Records, l969). He teaches in the =
Humanities and graduate Poetics programs at the New College of =
California. He lives in the Bay Area.

Unhurried Vision by Michael Rothenberg--Underneath the art of poetry =
exists the tradition of the journal-the attempt to capture and reveal =
the world as it passes by. Observations, reflections, and ideas =
accumulate to form connections and reveal process, content and story. =
Unhurried Vision is a record of the year 1999, and continues Michael =
Rothenberg's experiment with the journal. This is the year Philip Whalen =
became terminally ill and Rothenberg began taking care of him, pulled =
together Whalen's archives and library and edited his book of selected =
poems, Overtime. Political, personal, and romantic, Unhurried Vision =
works to savor the impermanent, looking at the moments in a poet's life, =
contemplating the body of experience. It is the mind on a quiet stroll =
through longing, loss and beauty.

Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael, is really a deeply =
loving celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet, roshi, & =
all around confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic odyssey =
through routes & roots of living & dying; a gastronome's pleasure dome, =
but above all a deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's =
centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the everyday =
extraordinary. Rothenberg's raw footage is disarming; sly, =
self-effacing, proclaiming, doubting, affirming. You can read it in one =
sitting, say blurboligists, but it takes at least a lifetime. & then =
what?=20

-David Meltzer

Born in Miami Beach, Florida in 1951, Michael Rothenberg is a poet and =
songwriter. He has been an active environmentalist in the San Francisco =
Bay Area for the past 25 years, where he cultivates orchids and =
bromeliads at his nursery, Shelldance. His broadside "Elegy for the =
Dusky Seaside Sparrow" was selected Broadside of the Year by Fine Print =
Magazine. The broadside of his poem "Angels" was produced in limited =
edition by Hatch Show Prints as part of The Country Music Foundation's =
museum resources. His songs have appeared in the films Shadowhunter, =
Black Day Blue Night and Outside Ozona. He is also editor and co-founder =
of Big Bridge Press and Big Bridge, an online magazine. Michael =
Rothenberg divides his time between Pacifica, California and Miami, =
Florida and is on the constant lookout for bottle caps and pennies for =
his son Cosmos.=20

Reviews of some older books, mostly rare


These are books that I have employed in my work, and think about and
through; I've found them at various times in my life. In no particular
order:

The Ocean World: Being a Description of The Sea and some of its
Inhabitants. from the French of Louis Figuier, New Edition revised by
E. Percevel Wright, Cassell, Petter, Galpin, +/- 1872. There are hundreds
of illustrations, almost all of invertebrates. Both illustrations and text
are poeticized, organic, swimming across the page. I consult this often.

The Lewis Carroll Picture Book, Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, T. Fisher
Unwin, 1899. Collected materials by his nephew, with Carroll's
illustrations and odd poems and collegiate texts among other things. An
addendum to the constant Alice-theorizing available a century later.

The Legends of the Rhine, H. A. Guerber, A. S. Barnes, 1895. Well, this is
simply fascinating in relation to Wagner, etc.

Baedeker's Berlin and its Environs, 1923. I consult this often in my other
readings; this is an intense image of Berlin Weimar culture.

The Athenian Oracle, edited by John Underhill, Walter Scott, 1897.
Selections from the late 17th-century magazine, with all its strangeness.

The Genuine Epistles of the Apostolical Fathers, also titled Wake's
Genuine Epistles, London, Richard Sare, 1710. This is a very early
edition; the print and language are fascinating, not to mention the texts,
many of which are now on my PDA.

The Blind Girl and Other Poems, Frances Jane Crosby, Wiley & Putnam, 1844
I've written about this elsewhere; Crosby went on to write hymns. She was
blind herself. Her poem on Niagara is wonderful.

Poems and Ballads, A New Edition, Swinburne, 1878. Precisely because
Swinburne disturbs me.

Swinburne, Selected Poems, illustrations by Harry Clarke, The Bodley Head,
1924. Clarke's illustrations, simultaneously severe and milky, mirror the
text.

Oeuvres de F. Rabelais, par L. Jacob, Charpentier, 1841. In the original
French with new and previously unpublished materials.

Poems by Felicia Hemans, edited by Rufus W. Griswold, Sorin and Ball, 1845
All I can see is these are soft, well-done, and continue to hold my
interest.

American Universal Geography, Jedidiah Morse, Isiah Thomas and Ebenezer
Andrews, June, 1796. A very early geography, largely of the United States.
The maps are torn/or missing, but the text, for me, is critical in
understanding the development of the frontier.

Drei und Dreissig Predigen von dem furnemstem Spaltungen in der
Christlichen Religion, Jacobum Andree, Tubingen, 1576. An early Lutheran
theologian concerned with uniting the Church. The Fraktur type is
beautiful and the binding is original. More a wonder of early books; I
don't have the wherewithal to read it.

A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence, Alfred Swaine Taylor, Henry Lea, 1866.
I read often into this early classic of forensic medicine; the pages on
rape are literally covered in human blood.

Illustrium Imagines, Andrea Fulvio, Rome, 1517. This book is discussed at
length in The Renaissance Computer; my edition has the original vellum
cover. There are over a hundred illustrations of Greek and Roman coins; it
was the first illustrated book on numismatics.

On the Laws of Japanese Painting, Henry P. Bowie, Paul Elder, 1911. This
book has been reprinted by Dover, but the illustrations are much finer in
the original. Think of Laws of Dots, Laws of Lines of the Garment, Laws of
Ledges, Laws of the Four Paragons...

Canadians should not feel smug

GRAHAM FRASER

OTTAWA--Smiles can be the most shocking things.

Arthur Fellig, a New Yorker who made his name as a freelance crime
photographer in the 1930s and 1940s under the name Weegee, knew this.

One of his most haunting photographs was of a drowning victim on a
beach. A crowd has gathered. An attractive girl in a bathing suit,
spotting the camera, smiles coquettishly. The incongruity of the smile
as a man lay dying made it a disturbing commentary on the power of the
camera in the modern age.

The memory of Shidane Arone, the Somali teenager who died in March,
1993, after being tortured by Canadian troops, still evokes a shudder --
partly because of the photographs of soldiers posing around his trussed
and tortured body.

That incident, and its initial cover-up, had a shattering impact on the
Canadian Forces. It resulted in several books and an inquiry. It ended
careers. It led to the abolition of an elite paratroop battalion, the
Canadian Airborne Regiment, and sweeping changes in the way our military
operates.

Now, photographs of horrifying abuse have emerged from Abu Ghraib prison
in Baghdad: pictures of torture, sexual exploitation and gross
humiliation. One of the most appalling things about them is that the
soldiers and prison guards are grinning at the camera, as if they were
on a spring break caper in Cancun.

There are a number of things to reflect on as these horrific images
emerge: the impact of new technology, the clash of cultures and the
corrupting effect of blending power and contempt.

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell compared the abuse with the
massacre of innocent civilians by U.S. soldiers at My Lai, during the
Vietnam War. Seymour Hersh broke the My Lai story some 35 years ago.
Last week, for the New Yorker, Hersh exposed torture by American
military personnel at Abu Ghraib. But no one posed for photographs at My
Lai, beaming at the camera, thumbs up.

The Bush administration has kept ruthless control of visual images.
Former president Ronald Reagan set the standard, with communications
director Michael Deaver managing every visual detail, no matter how
tiny, of Reagan's public appearances.

The visuals of the Iraq war have been handled with similar discipline.
Bush swaggering onto the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, Top Gun-style,
to the cheers of the sailors and the "mission accomplished" banner
appeared a year ago to be a political triumph. Not now.

As war spurred bitter insurgency, the Pentagon forbade any photographs
of coffins. But this is the new digital age, and a contract employee's
shots of rows of flag-draped coffins flashed around the world on the
Internet.

The same pattern occurred in Iraq. The Washington Post says it has more
than 1,000 digital photographs, some of them as graphic and humiliating
as those published by the New Yorker and broadcast by CBS.

"For many units serving in Iraq, digital cameras are pervasive and yet
another example of how technology has transformed the way troops
communicate with relatives back home," wrote Christian Davenport. "From
Basra to Baghdad, they e-mail pictures home."

Some are the cheerful snapshots of strangers in a foreign land, posing
in front of mosques, riding camels. Others are of naked men chained
together -- dragged into a strange world of sadistic torture and
pornographic games. It is the Arab and Muslim worst nightmare of
corrupted Western values, more powerfully expressed than any Osama bin
Laden monologue or radical cleric's sermon.

Canadian anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who influenced communications
theorist Marshall McLuhan, once observed that those who saw their own
image for the first time responded with what he called "the acute
anxiety of sudden self-awareness." This is equally stunning.

Politically, it is hard to imagine how this could be worse for Bush and
the United States, as self-styled liberators are shown as torturers, and
the cultural values of modesty and dignity are mocked and degraded. It
shows a breakdown of command, of discipline, of morality. No worst-case
scenario ever included photos of grinning soldiers posing with naked,
helpless Iraqi prisoners, or hooded figures standing, arms extended,
Christ-like, hooked up to wires.

The U.S. rejections of the relevance of the Geneva Convention and the
jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for war crimes now ring
hollow.

But no Canadian can feel smug or complacent. This not only can happen
here, it has. From decades of physical, cultural and sexual abuses at
aboriginal residential schools and in orphanages run by religious orders
to sordid, degrading initiation ceremonies and the torture and murder of
Shidane Arone that disgraced the Airborne, Canada has experienced this.

Arbitrary power mixed with cultural contempt is a toxic mix, but we have
no right to feel superior. We've been there.

I'd like to suggest some books. Take for instance the Collected Poems
of William Carlos Williams. Books are pretty good resources.

The Beothuks were wiped out on the island in the 18th Century, by Europeans.
But Canada did not slaughter native people. We hanged some men, and
should not have. But we did not ride into villages and slaughter the
women and children, as was done in Montana, and Iraq.

I will be leading a summer prose workshop, which will meet 10 Monday
evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to 10.  The dates:
June 7 through the end of August (no class June 21--also no class one
or two weeks in August--I'm still hammering out my August schedule).

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

My latest book, Pink Steam, a collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, will be published this June by San Francisco's
Suspect Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker
will be reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press this fall.  I'm
the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State
and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles. I've also taught at
CalArts, Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF
Art Institute.  I'm the winner of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for
Literature and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.
Or--if you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this
email along to them.  Past classes have filled up quickly, so if
you're interested do contact me promptly.

Best,
Dodie

Subject:      W Benjamin & Color
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I am starting a little piece on shop windows and color and the question came
to mind whether Benjamin ever used color in his own writing. On quick
re-reading, it's clear that he's transparently clear on the architecture of
the arcades, the structural use of iron to create the shapes through which
one would stroll, view, etc. But rarely do I see him working his eye to
expose the colors within the architecture. Actual color appears to escape
his critical index.
Then I began to think isn't there a pervasive grayness to his writer - an
analytically superior mind one hand, but mostly colorless. Ironic in terms
of his obsession with the "image" and its import.  Then I began to wonder
what would have happened to B's manner of writing and analysis if it had
been invaded and suffused with colors?

Perhaps it's the absence of a sense of color that permits B a greater in
depth sense of structure (the architecture of situations), yet at the loss
of sensual qualities that either betray or enhance our experience of shop
windows

Or is B's love of Proust - who breathed color (yet was a great analytical
mind) - informative here. Ironically B's translation of P into German is
supposedly lousy.

I am sure there are people on this list who know Benjamin much greater than
from my own relatively limited reading. Will appreciate a response

Ah, I'm sure that's a great consolation to those who were "wiped out."
And um, yeah, it was the "Europeans" who caused all the trouble here, too,
not "us."  And it's not just the Beothuks, either, by the way.  There are
more documents I could send, but I'm sure you could find them yourself...

here's the cryptic rocket four books thing, in Santa Barbara, CA -- I
admit I was curious ever since the posting -- also, would be very
interested to know about "poetics@ucsb" -- does the mysterious Yunte
have a new series!?!??!

Sandra
Reese. During an artist book workshop held in Poestenkill, NY in August
1997, at the invitation of Gunnar Kaldewey, four publishers of artist
books: Kaldewey Press, Poestenkill, NY and New York, NY; Arte Dos
Gr=E1fico, Bogot=E1, Colombia; Limestone Press, San Francisco, CA and =
Tampa,

exhibitions on four continents.

These exhibitions of =93The Rocket Four=94 are intended to increase the
visibility of artist books beyond those efforts and activities of each
press on its own. The somewhat obscure name is indebted to Luis Angel
Parra (Of Arte Dos Gr=E1fico), who uses a rocket gesture as a symbol of
activity, optimism and zest for life.

According to Hank Hine, =93An artist book, composed of its complex
elements, is an object like the world is, full of movement and sight and
sound. But this small world can be returned to again and again in its

apprehended. This is why we make books; to see them and comprehend what

I am finishing my two a day posting quota with this:



Am I to assume that all calls for work like this are actually

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:  SYMPOSIUM ON ART & TECHNOLOGY

ARTS OF THE VIRTUAL: POETIC INQUIRIES IN TIME, SPACE AND MOTION



The University of Utah announces an open call to all artists (previously
open to Utah artists only) involved in creative endeavors to submit
original electronic art for
presentation/installation/performance/discussion at the Symposium on
Arts and Technology to take place on the University of Utah campus
Sept.30-Oct.2 2004 in the New Media Wing of the Art and Architecture
Building.


As the three day symposium title suggests ("Arts of the Virtual: Poetic
Inquiries in Time, Space and Motion"), organizers are interested in work
incorporating innovative uses of digital technologies (virtual reality,
telepresence, high performance computing, special sensing, data driven
events, feedback systems, etc.) to deliver innovative aesthetic
experiences.  This acknowledges the increasing artistic interest at the
University of Utah and elsewhere in pushing the limits of knowledge and
expression as individuals and as a society.  Such efforts often involve
interdisciplinary collaborations with science and engineering.


Contributions from fields as diverse as dance, architecture,
engineering, the visual arts, design, computer science, music, theater,
mathematics, film, and others are encouraged.  All submissions will be
juried.

Work submitted must display at least one or more of the following
characteristics:

*       digitally-based (though it may/should include human
activity/performance)
*       interactivity
*       real time behavior/response



Evaluative criteria will be:

*       Uniqueness, judged as high level of innovation and creativity
within the context of state-of-the-art electronic arts.
*       Cohesiveness, judged as unity between concept, formal/structural
integrity and technological rendering/realization.
*       Interdisciplinary content, judged as collaboration among the
arts and beyond (the sciences, engineering, etc.).



The number of artworks selected by the jury will depend on submission
diversity, quality and appropriateness to the symposium guidelines.
Projects will be selected for one of two presentation formats:


        1. A twenty minute project presentation as part of a scheduled
panel of artists.
        2. A poster session/project exhibition in which the work is
displayed for informal
          walk through and discussion throughout the symposium.

The symposium will include figures of international standing in their
fields.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:



*       Sample of creative work (in electronic format; DVD, CD, VHS
etc.)
*       Summary description not to exceed 1,500 words
*       Technical and spatial presentation requirements (if any)
*       Curriculum vitae.



DEADLINE:   Postmarked Monday, May 31, 2004.

>Hi Steven,


I haven't read it but I sell it occasionally-a book called Walter
Benjamin - the colour of experience, by Howard CAYGILL: "an
interpretation of Benjamin's project & sensibility as one that
applied a Kantian concept of experience across an extraordinarily
large & unusually diverse range of objects.  Caygill argues from
Benjamin's writings for an understanding of Benjamin as primarily a
thinker of the visual.  And in so doing casts new light on much of
Benjamin's work".  Published by Routledge.

a list is a communality of people


if the world will disappear, i will make you smile, and i will disappear.
if i will speak no more, the moon will say to you, and if i say no more,
the sun will speak to you. for i will leave this list, and i will speak no
more, and i will leave the world, and you will see no more, nor will you
hear when i shall leave the world, nor will you speak, when i shall leave
the world. for your smile i will say the truth and leave a storm for you,
and for the moon, i will leave the sun and this sad world.:i will make a
storm for you if i will say the truth and i will make the sun come unto
the lord and beg forgiveness. for it is said, to beg forgiveness is the
sun and to demand such is the moon. if i will say a lie, i will make a
rainbow, and if you walk a while, the ends will be a circle. for to be at
the end is to witness the circle, whereof all of life, if the truth be
said, is the sun and the moon, and all of life is the moon and the sun. :i
will gladly give up this list if it will make you happier and i will give
up my life if it will make you smile but i will not give up my country,
it's of you, sweet land of liberty, long may it smile. i will leave this
happy world for peace and i will leave this sad world for the forsaking of
war and i will leave this world for you if it will make you smile. i will
destroy these words if they will make you mad but if they make you happy i
will give up this world, i will give up this world for you if it will make
you smile.:: sun and moon and world, how sad!

Beat Thing is David Meltzer's truly epic poem - an engagement with =
history & his own participatory & witnessing presence. If the title at =
first suggests a nostalgic romp through a 1950s-style beat scene, it =
doesn't take long before mid-twentieth-century America's urban =
pastoralism comes apart in all its phases & merges with the final =
solutions of death camps & death bombs from the preceding decade. This =
is collage raised to a higher power - a tough-grained & meticulously =
detailed poetry - "without check with original energy," as Whitman wrote =
- & very much what's needed now.
- Jerome Rothenberg=20

The Beat Thing sizzles as close as yesterday-with landmarks, names, =
occasions-as Poet Meltzer writes us back into the beat. Everyone's still =
There. As fresh as ever.
- Joanne Kyger

David Meltzer has gifted us with his beautifully written kabalistic and =
unique look at the Beat Generation. He also turns his eye to the =
American infrastructure of Bebop. This book comes out of his mature =
consciousness like energy spray bursting from the brow of a dolphin.
- Michael McClure

David Meltzer's most important lyri-political work. A profound =
juxtaposition in which the Beat Movement's meaning is resonated with the =
haunting of the Holocaust and the American years of McCarthyism and Jim =
Crowism. Like all great works, this entire book is single simultaneous =
moment in progress, written by a poet who - in terms of the rhythms, =
verbal inventiveness and the naming of figures of popular culture - is =
without equal anywhere.
- Jack Hirschman

David Meltzer is one of the secret treasures on our planet. Great poet, =
musician, comic; mystic unsurpassed, performer with few peers. His "ear" =
like we used to say and his erudition are fine-tuned and precise. A kind =
of bop-perfection pervades this work.
-Diane di Prima


"how easily narrative falls into place, realizes itself through a =
story-telling historian who sets out to frame a tangled constantly =
permutating chaos into a familiar & repeatable story w/out shadows or =
dead-ends; how impulsively memory organizes into a choir to tell a story =
of what it remembers symphonically, i.e., formally; even =
experimentalists practice w/in or against forms that have formed their =
relationship to writing & telling stories; history is the story of =
writing"=20

-Epilogue from Beat Thing


David Meltzer is the author of many volumes of poetry, including The =
Clown (Semina, 1960), The Process (Oyez, l965), Yesod (Trigram, l969), =
Arrows: Selected Poetry, 1957-1992 (Black Sparrow Press, 1994), and No =
Eyes: Lester Young (Black Sparrow, 2000). He has also published fiction, =
including The Agency Trilogy (Brandon House, l968; reprinted by Richard =
Kasak, 1994), Orf (Brandon House, l969; reprinted by Masquerade Books, =
l995), Under (Rhinoceros Books, 1997), and book-length essays, including =
Two-Way Mirror: A Poetry Notebook (Oyez, 1977). He has edited numerous =
anthologies and collections of interviews, including The Secret Garden: =
An Anthology in the Kabbalah (Continuum Press, 1976; reprinted, Station =
Hill Press, 1998), Birth: Anthology of Ancients Texts, Songs, Prayers, =
and Stories (North Point Press, 1981), Death: Anthology of Texts, Songs, =
Charms, Prayers, and Tales (North Point Press, 1984), Reading Jazz =
(Mercury House, 1996), Writing Jazz (Mercury House, 1999), and San =
Francisco Beat: Talking With the Poets (City Lights, 2001). His musical =
recordings include Serpent Power (Vanguard Records, l968; reissued on CD =
in 1996) and Poet Song (Vanguard Records, l969). He teaches in the =
Humanities and graduate Poetics programs at the New College of =
California. He lives in the Bay Area.

Unhurried Vision by Michael Rothenberg--Underneath the art of poetry =
exists the tradition of the journal-the attempt to capture and reveal =
the world as it passes by. Observations, reflections, and ideas =
accumulate to form connections and reveal process, content and story. =
Unhurried Vision is a record of the year 1999, and continues Michael =
Rothenberg's experiment with the journal. This is the year Philip Whalen =
became terminally ill and Rothenberg began taking care of him, pulled =
together Whalen's archives and library and edited his book of selected =
poems, Overtime. Political, personal, and romantic, Unhurried Vision =
works to savor the impermanent, looking at the moments in a poet's life, =
contemplating the body of experience. It is the mind on a quiet stroll =
through longing, loss and beauty.

Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael, is really a deeply =
loving celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet, roshi, & =
all around confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic odyssey =
through routes & roots of living & dying; a gastronome's pleasure dome, =
but above all a deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's =
centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the everyday =
extraordinary. Rothenberg's raw footage is disarming; sly, =
self-effacing, proclaiming, doubting, affirming. You can read it in one =
sitting, say blurboligists, but it takes at least a lifetime. & then =
what?=20

-David Meltzer

Born in Miami Beach, Florida in 1951, Michael Rothenberg is a poet and =
songwriter. He has been an active environmentalist in the San Francisco =
Bay Area for the past 25 years, where he cultivates orchids and =
bromeliads at his nursery, Shelldance. His broadside "Elegy for the =
Dusky Seaside Sparrow" was selected Broadside of the Year by Fine Print =
Magazine. The broadside of his poem "Angels" was produced in limited =
edition by Hatch Show Prints as part of The Country Music Foundation's =
museum resources. His songs have appeared in the films Shadowhunter, =
Black Day Blue Night and Outside Ozona. He is also editor and co-founder =
of Big Bridge Press and Big Bridge, an online magazine. Michael =
Rothenberg divides his time between Pacifica, California and Miami, =
Florida and is on the constant lookout for bottle caps and pennies for =
his son Cosmos.=20

I'd like to suggest some books. Take for instance the Collected Poems

Subject:      Call for Submissions: Red Giant
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Red Giant will be a one-shot chapbook, a mini-anthology, of speculative
poetry and poetry informed by science fiction, with an emphasis on work
from experimental and innovative practices. It will be published by the
Press of the Taverner in November 2004.

Speculative poetry cuts a wide swath through a many different traditions
(or anti-traditions) in disparate writing communities, including both
science fiction iconographies in popular culture and the language of
scientific disciplines. Whether the poetry's roots--in subject matter or
processes--are in A Scanner Darkly or The Crystal Text, Tiptree or Prynne,
killer androids in role playing games or cybernetics, space opera or
quantum mechanics, it's all pretty much fair game for Red Giant.

Contributors will receive three copies.

The reading period is between the postmark dates of June 1-August 15. Email
or print submissions are welcome during this time. Email submissions to
editor@taverners-koans.com, with "Red Giant submission" in the subject
line. Stories can be snail mailed to:

Alan DeNiro, Editor
Red Giant
PO Box 28701
St. Paul, MN 55128

No reprints. Simul. submissions ok if notified immediately after acceptance
somewhere else.

Feel free to email the above address with any questions. These guidelines
were updated 5.7.04. Feel free to distribute widely. They can also be found
at http://www.taverners-koans.com/redgiant.html in their most recent form.

DeLay Disputes That New Pictures Show 'Horrific Acts':
Pentagon Makes Images Available to House, Senate:
Rumsfeld Thumbs His Nose At Congress:
Congress Applauds Wildly:
by Pauline Hyjeiniks


The Anti-Empire Report, No. 10, May 12, 2004
by William Blum




They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Please join us at Small Press Traffic for our final reading of the spring:


Friday, May 14, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.
Lisa Jarnot & Cynthia Sailers


Lisa Jarnot's third collection, Black Dog Songs, is new from Flood Editions.
Stan Brakhage writes: "However adrift in linguistic aesthetics, in sheer
music-of-rhythmed-sounds, her words are never severed from the means that
engendered them; and the consequent meanings are never detached from the
meditative drama of each whole poem." Jarnot joins us from NYC; her previous
works are Some Other Kind of Mission and Ring of Fire. Her critical biography
of Robert Duncan will be published by UC Press next year.


Local heroine Cynthia Sailers joins us in celebration of her first full-length
collection, Lake Systems, just out from Tougher Disguises. Sailers is a
California native (San Diego, 1974) who now lives in Alameda and co-curates
the New Brutalism Reading Series in Oakland. Her work has or will appear in
various journals, including Aufgabe, 14 Hills, LitVert.com, pompom, Small
Tiger, Barn (v.), and Involuntary Vision: Poems after Kurosawa's Dreams.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCA faculty, staff, and students.


Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin) Our 30th anniversary season begins in September -- yay!

Tina Chang's poems perform the ancient tasks of remembrance, recovery, =
and praise. This work seeks to account for a life in the context of the =
myths, cultural and familial, that both nurture and threaten that very =
life and the voice that might sing it into legend. This is a poetry of =
amazing lushness, melancholy and affirmation.=20
                -Li-Young Lee=20

Her mouth is fertile, seeded with incidents from a family history that =
lay scattered about like grains of rice upon which our poet kneels. =
Misfit and starlet, she wrestles with her father on earth and in Heaven. =
Whether seasoned with gunpowder or with sugar, Tina Chang's legacy is =
neither entirely Chinese nor American but an inheritance to be spoken =
through dialects-a composite language forged out of her many lyrical =
selves.=20
                -Timothy Liu

        Instrumentality=20
        <http://www.cherry-grove.com/shankar.html>

Instrumentality plays expectations and delivers uncanny reformulations =
that seem "predestined, in retrospect." Rave Shaker's poems are filled =
with the pleasure of subjects dissolving into ideas, ideas folding into =
sounds, and sounds echoing familiar but elusive translocations.=20
-Charles Bernstein

This is a very special first book. Ravi Shankar's poems have a fine =
tuned sense of form, a rare delight in language. Through wit and =
abstraction they reveal a metaphysics of longing, binding us to the =
elements of our moving world.
                -Meena Alexander

Quirky, quizzical, inquisitive, Ravi Shankar in Instrumentality goes in =
quest of what the oddness of language and imagination can reveal: "a =
hush of atoms holding a planet together." By turns, lyrical and =
meditative, these poems are guided by a strong intelligence toward =
resolutions that are both surprising and apt.=20
                -Gregory Orr

        The Opening Question=20
        <http://www.fencebooks.com/new_titles.html>

Sharma is inclined to explore cultural disjunctions, the glide of sound, =
power, and perception between people and languages: "you are pointing =
west when you say dish, desh." Sometimes she sounds as American as John =
Berryman. But at other times Sharma serializes simple declarative =
statements or taps into a kind of Berlitz translation diction: "We are =
an Indian family with Indian friends from India." In other words, her =
imagination is whirring at full tilt, and her approaches to the poem are =
varied and fresh and exciting.=20

BUKOWSKI: BORN INTO THIS

A Film by John Dullaghan
Official Selection Sundance Film Festival 2003
Official Selection Tribeca Film Festival 2003

""Wordsworth, Whitman, William Carlos Williams and The Beats in their
respective generations moved poetry toward a more natural language. =
Bukowski
moved it a little farther."  - Los Angeles Times Book Review

Premiering May 28th at Landmark's Lumiere Theatre and the Landmark Act 1 =
&
2!

Author Charles Bukowski was one of those rare writers whose work created =
a
myth of epic proportions around its creator. Over the years, the name
"Bukowski" has become synonymous with screwing, drinking and fighting, =
seedy
barrooms, low-paying jobs and low-rent hotel rooms. For readers, =
Bukowski
has come to personify the lower depths of human existence; in a direct,
powerful and very personal style, he writes about an unthinkable but =
very
real degradation, based on his own life experiences.

BUKOWSKI: BORN INTO THIS, the first comprehensive documentary of Charles
Bukowski (1920-1994), traces his extraordinary life < from an abusive
childhood through decades of poverty and alcoholism; numerous menial =
jobs
and turbulent relationships; through 14 years as a postal employee; and =
his
eventual international celebrity as a poet, novelist and underground =
cult
icon. In his lifetime, Bukowski became most widely known as the =
screenwriter
and real-life model for BARFLY, the feature film based on his early =
life.
Director John Dullaghan spent seven years researching and shooting =
BUKOWSKI,
traveling the world to obtain rare archival material, and conducting =
dozens
of interviews with relatives, teenage pals, fellow post office workers,
girlfriends and other poets, as well as better-known friends like Bono, =
Sean
Penn, Harry Dean Stanton, Barbet Schroeder and Taylor Hackford. =
Bukowski's
wife Linda, with whom Dullaghan helped organize the Bukowski archive in =
San
Pedro, CA, is also a key commentator.

While the film was undertaken out of an appreciation for Bukowski, =
Dullaghan
goes to great lengths to present the different sides of the author, =
offering
the most revealing look yet of Bukowski and his work. The result is a =
film
that peels off the hardened mask of the mythic Bukowski to reveal the
insecure, loving and extremely human man=20
"A definitive screen overview of the L.A. booze bard, BUKOWSKI: BORN =
INTO
THIS makes a compelling case for raising him from cult status to the top
rank of 20th century U.S. literary figures < while providing ample =
evidence
of a very colorful life and times... A particularly entertaining screen
bio... A coherent, engrossing narrative." Dennis Harvey, Variety

    The glorious spring-like weather throughout August makes San Miguel a perfect travel destination. San Miguel possesses European
ambience -- it is stunning, cultured, and urbane.

    Nestled in the Sierra Madres north of Mexico City, San Miguel has made a name for itself in writing and artistic circles around
the world with its quaint, seductive charm -- including its four-century old churches, cobblestone streets, and shady, peaceful
gardens.

    We invite you to immerse yourself in luxury while writing, sharing, and learning in a creative, fun, and inspirational workshop.
Your week includes all ground transportation, hotel, all meals, spa treatments, day tours and classes in traditional Mexican
cooking.

    Students will also participate in evening readings and receive private critiques with Janice or Beverly.

Details on the two workshops follow:

MEMOIR WORKSHOP with BEVERLY DONOFRIO

    Beverly Donofrio, the author of cult classic Riding in Cars with Boys, will present a Memoir Workshop to inspire your inner
writer in a safe, noncompetitive environment.

"Beverly Donofrio assists the writer to choose the most telling details from his/her life and helps one dig deeper to find the
emotion behind the scene."

- Susan McKinney de Ortega, author, Tales of My Disappearance

      When Beverly Donofrio’s memoir, Riding in Cars with Boys, was published in 1990, it helped define the genre. A cult classic,
it was made into a Hollywood movie starring Drew Barrymore. Her second memoir, Looking for Mary, was chosen by Barnes and Noble as
one of the best books of the year and has since touched hearts everywhere.

    The president of PEN San Miguel, she has delivered commentaries about her life and experiences on National Public Radio; she has
also written for TV, is published in numerous anthologies, and is a frequent contributor to national magazines. Donofrio is an
inspirational teacher who will create a safe, noncompetitive environment to help writers of all levels:

     • Use inventive techniques to stimulate memory
and break down defenses
     • Diminish emotional resistances
     • Shape experience into story
     • Compose compelling scenes
     • Locate voice
     • Enhance description

 FICTION WORKSHOP WITH JANICE EIDUS

     Janice Eidus is a two-time winner of the O. Henry Prize, among other awards. In this workshop, you will explore all the
essential elements of writing fiction, while finding new inspiration and focus.

"There's simply no other creative writing teacher who has Janice Eidus's passion, dedication, and wisdom. She is singular, and a
treasure."

        -- Lisa Dierbeck, author, One Pill Makes You Smaller

     Award-winning writer Janice Eidus is actively engaged in long-time love affairs with both writing and teaching. She writes and
lectures about such diverse subjects as writing, Jewish identity, women’s issues, creativity, popular culture, and how to get
published.

    She's twice won the O. Henry Prize, as well as a Redbook Prize, a Pushcart Prize, and a National Writers Voice Residency Award,
among other awards. She is the author of the short story collections, The Celibacy Club and Vito Loves Geraldine, and the novels,
Urban Bliss and Faithful Rebecca, as well as co-editor of It's Only Rock And Roll: an Anthology of Rock and Roll Short Stories.

    In this supportive and safe workshop, writers of all levels will:
     • Explore essential elements of fiction
     • Locate voice
     • Deepen characterization
     • Clarify conflict
     • Enhance description
     • Develop fresh ideas from our real
       and imagined lives

A short poem made up of phrases that actually left
George
W. Bush's mouth,
as arranged by Washington Ghost writer, Richard
Thompson.


MAKE THE PIE HIGHER

I think we all agree, the past is over.
This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen and uncertainty
And potential mental losses.


Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?
Will the highways of the Internet
Become more few?


How many hands have I shaked?
They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.


I know that the human being
And the fish can coexist.
Families is where our nation finds hope,
Where our wings take dream.


Put food on your family!
Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanize society!
Make the pie higher!
Make the pie higher!

everal articles from previous Dreamtime Talkingmails have been posted
on the website:

Permanent TAZs by Hakim BEY:
TAZ-theory tries to concern itself with existing or emerging
situations rather than with pure utopianism.=A0=A0 All over the world
people are leaving or "disappearing" themselves from the Grid of
Alienation and seeking ways to restore human contact...
http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/articles/permanent_taz.html

Proposal for a Semi-Permeable Dreamtime
by Peter Lamborn Wilson:
In trying to arrive at "graceful skill" in the planning and
carrying-out of celebration - or what might be called FESTAL ZEN - a
nice balance of structure and spontaneity is required...

Taking Off from Zone Zero
by Elizabeth Was:
In permaculture, one maps out one's land in terms of Zones, designing
it according to distance, usage of the plants, tending requirements,
etc. You'd plant your culinary herbs in Zone 1, for example, just
outside the door or even on the windowsill. The vegetable garden might
be in Zone 2, animals in Zone 3, nurseries or orchards in Zone 4 , &
Zone 5 would be the woods. You won't find Zone 0 in many permaculture
books, but I understand it as the self, located somewhere in or near
the body, & it is the Zone that most concerns me personally...
http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/articles/taking_off_zone_zero.html

The NO GO ZONE by Hakim Bey:
...I'm thinking of certain old European genre paintings which always
fascinated me as a child, depicting peasants or gypsies living in the
ruins of some vanished empire -- usually Roman. The images appealed to
a Bachelardian sense of reverie and magic about certain kinds of
"home", certain kinds of "space". I like the sense of abandonment
implied in the paradox of abandoned ruins brought to life by
"abandoned" bohemians, low-lifes, Breughelian fiddlers and dancers --
the contrast of the heavy remains of vanished triumphalism with the
lightness and brightness of nomads...
http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/articles/no_go_zone.html

Quantum Eschatology by Professor Nicholas Edwards:
...eat the spectacle and spit it out through on board avid, dat the
birds in the morning and internet it by afternoon, drink herbal teas,
hear the scream of the mandrake and lick the flesh of the gods,
charter astral planes, tour the globe and create hemp farms in eastern
europe, revive biodeversity, occupy and take over universities, create
crop circles from the heights of invisibility...
http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/articles/quantum_eschatology.html

Inside Zone Zero
by Elizabeth Was
In Her Guy Dance with the Quantum Egg:
Sickness, Synchrons, & the Dark:
Red, yellow, purple, blue. Sweet summer flower colors. Yeah, well
these are the colors of my skin as the birds chirp outside our bedroom
window. That's a plant of a different color, isn't it? I'll call it
poison ivy: That's the plant I unwittingly chose two weeks ago as my
current teacher. Like a zen master she sits comfortably back there on
that hill, smiling at me as I wriggle & burn up from the inside out
with a fever & a fervor to match any lusty young lover half my age...

Inside Zone Zero
- a continuing column by elizabeth was
CONCERNING
a permaculture of the self
Part III. EXO - INDO: The Healing Chameleon:
An old turtle makes her way slowly forward, between the railroad
tracks, each step, solid as armor. "My feet touch the warm brown
earth." She has just woken from a dream about exposure - blind naked
shell-less fleshy vulnerability - a place she knows she has to visit,
again and again...

page sixth {The videotape of the beheading last night - I downloaded and examined for
hidden characters/messages - left me feeling nightmarish; it combines
with memories of reading the medical cases in Nazi Germany, the tortures
in Israel, body parts in Gaza, prison torture images, and it doesn't help
that both men assassinated in Iraq were Jews; our army is Jewish, Jews
are everywhere and will bring the world down with them. I am included; I
will do my part; today I left the netbehaviour email list after replying
in kind or too vehemently to an attacker of the SMASH piece which I stand
behind. All of us have our horrors and horror-stories; the worst in fact
is the necessity of defense...
Today reading in the following:
The Electric Interurban Railways in America, Hilton and Due, Stanford -
well this is cheering; I remember such from Wilkes-Barre to Scranton when
I was very young - unfortunately, unlike, say, as in Japan, they didn't
last -
Writings on Art and Literature, Freud, Stanford as well and all the usual
suspects. From the period of the _understandable world._
Women's Writings 1778-1838, An Anthology, edited by Fiona Robertson -
this is in the Oxford World's Classics, and is wonderful - an amazing
period - Hemans is in it, Shelley as well -
Prophetic Writings of Eleanor Davies, Esther S. Cope, Oxford. A
17th-century prophet - there were apparently quite a few. Rushed writing
almost in a religious frenzy, quite wonderful.
And this - The Human Impact Reader, Readings and Case Studies, edited by
Andrew Goudie - really _can_ recommend this from 1997, Blackwell. We need
to be reminded of these concrete particulars - for example - Lowering of
a Shallow, Saline Water Table by Extensive Eucalypt Reforestation - these
things are serious although they appear perhaps minor, anecdotal - but in
fact, for example again, reforestation is a highly contested issue
worldwide -
Meanwhile the earth totters, suffers, one takes notes, leaves lists,
waits for exhaustion to kick in, no more thinking in these parts -

Rumsfeld visits Abu Ghraib Prison, where he is immediately stripped and put
on a leash. He barks a few times, then rolls over laughing. It turns out it
was all part of an immense prank by Tom Delay, in order to embarrass the Red
Cross and other liberals.

Outsider' poet awarded $100,000

By Charles Storch
Tribune staff reporter

May 12, 2004

Kay Ryan, a California poet who has shied from even the small limelight
verse affords, was named Tuesday the winner of the $100,000 Ruth Lilly
Prize.

The honor, one of the richer verse prizes, was bestowed by the
Chicago-based Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine and the
beneficiary of a gift expected to exceed $100 million from Indianapolis
philanthropist Lilly. The foundation has given the award since 1986.

Poetry editor Christian Wiman, one of the prize judges, said Ryan has
"simply made no effort to promote herself, concentrating instead on honing
a small, idiosyncratic and durable body of work." He said her poems are
"very spare. They are always short but not small. She takes on big
subjects."

Reached at her home in Fairfax, Calif., Ryan said of her image as an
"outsider" poet: "The limelight didn't come seeking me particularly until
now."

Winning the Lilly "made me feel wonderful to know there are many ways of
achieving recognition. One way is staying home and doing your work and not
gadding about," she said.

The 59-year-old native of San Jose, Calif., has spent the last 33 years as
a part-time teacher of basic writing skills in Marin County.

"I like it," she told Salon.com several years ago. "It's just as
uncomplicated as giving blood."

She said her poetry is "brief, amusing, demanding, filled with all sorts
of sound devices, like rhymes but not above puns."

Ryan had been primarily known to small-press readers until The New Yorker
magazine began publishing her works a decade ago. She has written five
collections, the most recent being "Say Uncle" in 2000.

An early admirer of her work was poet and critic Dana Goia. In a 1999
essay in Dark Horse magazine, Goia, now the chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, cited "the unusual compression and density of
Ryan's work."

Subject:      Bombay Gin (Naropa) question
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I bought Bombay Gin # 29, the Naropa literary journal,
at the St. Mark's Bookstore the other night.  (It's a
great read.)

The frontispiece says "Submission guidelines are
available on-line at www.naropa.edu/gin.html" ---but,
in fact, that URL comes up "Not Found."

The issue still does provide a mailing address for
them at Naropa, ---but I'm wondering if there was
supposed to be any essential information at that
defunct website, like reading periods or something.

Does anybody know more about Bombay Gin and these
questions?

Thanks.

Dear All,

I'm very sorry but due to circumstances beyond our control, we have had to
cancel the reading by Lisa Jarnot & Cynthia Sailers, scheduled for tonight
(May 14). I apologize for the disappointment as well as the late notice, which
was unavoidable. It is my hope that we will be able to reschedule both of
these great poets to read in our 04-05 season, which will begin in September.

Thank you.

Lisa Jarnot has cancelled her trip to the West
Coast for now due to personal reasons, so tomorrow
night's reading (Sat., May 15) is off, too. James
Meetze and Sarah Rosenthal are reading next week
(Friday, May 21) and I am looking into
rescheduling Brandon Brown, possibly for that
night -- stay tuned.

If anyone wants to stop by for a beer tomorrow
night i'll still be around.

Stephen,

I have started to think of it. You are right, WB very rarely mentions or=20
describes colors. To me, this does not mean his writing is "gray" in a negat=
ive=20
sense. I think it is endlessly imaginative and provocative, making us ask th=
e=20
right questions, to which one has to respond. The responses create new=20
directions. Whether one agrees with him or not is to some extent irrelevant.

I think his actual translations are not very good, but "The Task of the=20
Translator" is the most provocative exploration of the translation process I=
 know:=20
I have thought it meant different things at different times in my life.

The quotations in "The arcades Project" are what makes the book so=20
fascinating, a "photograph" almost of the structure of 19th century thought.=
 His=20

In my perambulations through the archives (I suffer
from want of poets to jaw-wag-a-with in Taiwan), I
came across this description of Guy Debord’s work as
fwded (retouched?) by one Charles Bernstein. What fun
for the holidays! Go through The Spectacle of Society
and replace every instance of ‘spectacle’ with
‘show-biz.’

It's like reading Taiwanese (comp. lit) graduate
theses. Almost exactly.


>Ben Friedlander passed this bulletin on to me from a
clarinet list.  I
had not yet heard about Debord's death.  Having just
read the new
and worthwhile translation of The Society of the
Spectacle for my
current graduate seminar, Debord has been very much on
my mind.
(The description of his work in the notice is quite
odd.)

Seeing Eye has just published "Prepositional" by=20
Martha Ronk.

Just as prepositions connect nouns to other words=20
and define the relationships that bind them=20
together, so do the poems that make up=20
"Prepositional" form a nexus of discrete=20
connections linking thought to language,=20
quotidian events, and philosophical meditation,=20
all of which are concerns lie at the heart of=20
Martha Ronk's writing.

"Prepositional" is available as part of this=20
year's Seeing Eye Books series, which also=20
includes work by Dolores Dorantes, Val=E8re=20
Novarina, and Candace Pirnak. If you would like=20

As something that might be interesting I have joined my original query with
several interesting responses. Interestingly no one, so far, has been able
to find the use of color(s) in a Benjamin sentence. Which is not to say that
such does not exist, but different than, say, Proust, where one cannot
imagine Proust without an awareness of the multiple ways he employs color to
substantiate 'the thoughts in his prose'.

I guess I am most interested in what way the absence of a quality - in this
case color - creates in terms of dialog (critical &/or creative) between
what is absent and what is present in a work? What does, for example, an
absence  of color in Benjamin enable in his argument, and how does his
refusal  literally shade an argument in a particular direction (say,
"melancholy", David-Baptiste suggests.) What would happen if someone
literally went through Benjamin's texts covered them with transparent
multiple-color washes. Or - with Adobe Photoshop - took color to the black
and white photographs of the original Paris Arcades to evoke the original
period colors as taken from other sources.

Would the de-sacralisation of the Benjamin's argumentation - through
oppositions and additions -  possibly open a new way of looking at the
Arcades.
I was driven to thinking about these possibilities recently while walking
along the boardwalk between Santa Monica and Venice: an open air arcade that
led me back to a kind of dialog with Benjamin. But that's a larger or
different, tho related story.

Dear Stepehn Vincent:

Thank you for your comment and question re Benjamin's lack of sense of
color--amazing for someone writing about Baudelaire and as well B's piece on
"the painter of modern art".
With your comment in mind began trying to recall from readings extensive but
some time ago in WB--regarding as well his sense of hearing--recall next to
nothing in regards to sounds, music--voices--
It is a world limited primarily to text--the readings of the material world
are all filtered through texts--i think in part why he doesn't describe shop
windows in terms of color, lighting, the forms employed, arrangements--
It is the same in his writings re "the masses"--they do not function in any
partcular way, i.e. they are a kind of indistinguishable silent grey
"mass"--to which various textual ideas are attributed--
this allows for much of the aphoristic style he uses, in which words can be
moved around the more easily as abstracted to some degree from the senses
and particularities.
To write of materialism becomes a way towards the eradication of the
sensory--hence in some part the positing of the loss of the aura in the face
of quantities of reproductions--
I have often wondered if a great deal of the appeal in Benjamin doesn't lie
in his being seen as a figure, a configuration--of mourning, of
loss--indeed, a world of ruins, allegorical and melancholic--which oddly
gives a sense of ethical/moral tone one finds in his writings--
At times he essays countering this with his strident Leftist sloganeering,
in phrases that ring with a kind of vehemence at odds with much of the
passivity in his work--
I think that as an innately bourgeois subjectivity, he grasps as you note
the monumentalities of the arcades, the accumulations therein, the
architectural settings for a teeming bric-a-brac--
(One notes his essay on say "The Collector"--)
"Benjamin's Baudelaire"--has very much surpassed in critical terms any
notion of Baudelaire himself--his writings--without their interpretation via
Benjamin--the critic has nearly swallowed the artist--and left of him a
figure in an urban landscape--the flaneur and so forth--
(again the political and ethical come into play, converge--the critic is
much more acceptable in these ways than the artist--who after all addressed
the "hypocrite reader, who resembles me, my brother")--
Perhaps by being so little aware of the sensations of color and
sound--Benjamin has missed as well a great in Baudelaire that in
Baudelairean terms is of the utmost importance--
The essay on Haschish is also like this--senses of architecture--but liitle
else--
Thank you for your comment and question--(again, it is has been many ice
ages since have read WB--at one point read a very good deal of him--got much
use out of his thinking in many ways--and in others find it too focused on
the melancholic--and often too often just mechanically quoted and parroted
without the persons doing the quoting really essaying a thinking
through--)--
so in the end, it does return again to--text!--
all bests--david-baptiste

Stephen,

I have started to think of it. You are right, WB very rarely mentions or
describes colors. To me, this does not mean his writing is "gray" in a
negative
sense. I think it is endlessly imaginative and provocative, making us ask
the
right questions, to which one has to respond. The responses create new
directions. Whether one agrees with him or not is to some extent irrelevant.

I think his actual translations are not very good, but "The Task of the
Translator" is the most provocative exploration of the translation process I
know:
I have thought it meant different things at different times in my life.

The quotations in "The arcades Project" are what makes the book so
fascinating, a "photograph" almost of the structure of 19th century thought.
His
"original" parts (shown in the American edition at least by a different
fonts) are
not as interesting, at least to me. That's perhaps what you mean by the
distinction between structure and color.

Murat

**
I haven't read it but I sell it occasionally-a book called Walter
Benjamin - the colour of experience, by Howard CAYGILL: "an
interpretation of Benjamin's project & sensibility as one that
applied a Kantian concept of experience across an extraordinarily
large & unusually diverse range of objects.  Caygill argues from
Benjamin's writings for an understanding of Benjamin as primarily a
thinker of the visual.  And in so doing casts new light on much of
Benjamin's work".  Published by Routledge.

Dear Stephen
You could begin with two early pieces by Benjamin, Aphorisms on Imagination
and Colour, and A Child's View of Colour (both in the Harvard Selected
Writings Vol I). There's also a dialogue on the rainbow in the collected
works (Der Regenbogen, GS VII, 562-4).
The best commentary on the topic is Howard Caygill, Walter Benjamin: the
colour of experience (Routledge, 1998)

John Whitehad was murdered earlier this week outside of his home in
Germantown, Philly. He was an innocent bystander caught in crossfire as he
was fixing his truck.

Whitehead (half of the songwriting team McFadden & Whitehead) gave us some
of the the best of TSOP. They wrote "Backstabbers", performed by the O'Jays,
"I'll Always Love My Mama", performed by The Intruders, & "Wake Up
Everybody", performed by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes. They also recorded
their own hit, "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now", which has been, and will continue
to be a Philadelphia anthem.

Stephen,

I think there is another way of looking at colors, not as attributes but as=20
light. Given that fact black and white do not constitute an absence (gray) b=
ut=20
a particular play of light. Color in Benjamin is a play of light/play of=20
perception. Didn't Goethe say that colors have as much to do with perception=
 as=20
"objective" reality.

It is true that Benjamin does not describe if something is red or blue, but=20
his thoughts on photography are commentaries on color. Dead babies were comm=
on=20
subjects in early photographs, which were drawn to static objects because it=
=20
took a long time to register light. Civil war photographs of direct action a=
re=20
full of double exposures or blurs, which give the special power to them (isn=
't=20
that blur a color, a play of light?). Many Civil War photos are of the=20
peripheries of action -dead or wounded soldiers, their possessions, a soldie=
r on=20
leave, etc. (I talk in deatail about this in "The Peripheral Space of=20
Photography.) This bias in photography towards stasis, both in the taking an=
d viewing,=20
makes a subversive melancholy part of photographic essence.

I am bringing in the subject of photography because Benjamin's writing has=20
the same qualities. It is not gray but black and white. For instance, a quot=
e in=20
"The Arcades Project" functions exactly like a photograph. It reflects (not=20
states) a thought which the reader picks and reflects upon: texts as=20
reflections.

There were times when I thought Benjamin was completely wrong on a given=20
subject. In time, I realized that either I misunderstood him (always a possi=
bility=20
with him) or did not see immediately see the profound question he was=20
raising, how he was far ahead of his time: for instance, his concept of "ide=
al=20
language" in relation to translation; or his seeing photography as belonging=
 to the=20
age of mechanical reproduction, while also referring to its aura. These two=20
thoughts seem so contradictory.

At the present, I am trying to understand how he sees "narrative," the=20
bete-noire of the last twenty years. There is no questions he envisions a na=
rrative=20
which trascends the "bourgeois" prejudices we associate the term with. A=20
narrative of essences which, for example, the Taiwanese director (T. T. T,?)=
, the=20
maker of "The Shainghai Flowers," etc., develops.

In my view, global capitalist world, the peculiar metrapolis, communication=20
system it creates, can not be understood without a critical confrontation wi=
th=20
Bejamin.Benjamin gives us clues for a critique and artistic transcendance of=
=20
that world -the analystic and artistic means of doing so. His absolute=20
understanding of the nature of manifactured imagery must start any understan=
ding of=20
the nature of our world.  =20

Thanks again for your queries.

Peace,

This info concerning  the "anthologies on Black British Colombian queer=20
writings" is incorrect. Bluesprints is actually the first collection of=20
Black British Colombians' writing and poetry from the 19th century to=20
the present day.


"Compton's anthology provides a documentary history of migration
and transformation within British Columbia's black communities
from 1858 to the present. He describes the work as "the tracing of a
phantom lineage," charting the waves of migration between Canada, the
United States, the Caribbean, Africa and Europe. Like exiled South
African poet Arthur Nortje, who made BC his home between 1967 and 1969,
many black BC writers have maintained their transnational identities,
thus Kingston reverberates through the work of Vancouver's Hope
Anderson and we read Saltspring via Cleveland in the work of American
transplant Fred Booker." -- the danforth review

http://www.danforthreview.com/reviews/nonfiction/bluesprint.htm

"Braithwaite's work is brilliant, and represents the
distinct voice of black BC literature, a matter-of-fact defiance of
traditional ideas about race, class and sexuality in popular cultures
and in black literary criticism. "  -- the danforth review


I am wrting this note to inform you that the one story which is claimed t=
o have been concerning "queer" and  "queering the gangster" is actually a=
 composition by Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite which has very little to abso=
lutely nothing to do with homosexuality or queer culture.  B.U.T. concern=
s itself with the recruitment of underprivileged youths into the criminal=
 economy as disposable human exports for the "benevolent dictatorship" wh=
ich is Victoria, British Colombia if not the landscape of canada in it's =
entirety. "Trunk Music", the story in question, does not promote homosexu=
ality nor does it condone the misguided and lost "queer culture" and that=
 of british Columbia which has shown extreme right-wing affiliations, as =
well as, the normalization of the exploitation of youth. It should be not=
ed that not this nor any of the work be subjugated to that of  the baser =
desires of the sexual ghetto filled with poor unfortunates devoid of cult=
ure and driven to manufactured elitist, faithless CONsumer identity of th=
e physical.  Any attempt to surrender the author's work to this catagory =
would be only to delegitimze the work and anything and one affliated with=
 it from the essence of the versionization my  eliotianian and ellingtoni=
an philosophy of "traditon and individaul talent".=20

The author wishes to, once and for all, disavow himself from the disinfor=
mation that his writings have any connection to the queer community and w=
ith that let it be noted that he is an author of the modernist school who=
 utilizes the diasporic tradition of Sankofa, deep contreation, music/son=
ics and lingusitics to trace the struggles of class, race and culture in =
this the time of the afrikan and islamiziation of a thuggish western worl=
d out to colonize the Original Peopls of the earth and once and for all t=
ap all their naturla resources from the oraginic to the collective uncons=
ciouse of the spiritual creative plain in an an attempt to establish a ne=
oslavery and surfdom. Let it be noted that by "An Original Peoples", the =
work include Natives Peoples, as well as, the so called "black" people wh=
o continue to fight for their self determination with honour within an am=
erikkka obessed in its centre of "power, sex and violence".

This one; this work, has now and always has been for for my peoples who s=
truggle inna world in terror of the other of the class, race, ethinicity =
and culture.=20

"Braithwaite's work is brilliant, and represents the
distinct voice of black BC literature, a matter-of-fact defiance of
traditional ideas about race, class and sexuality in popular cultures
and in black literary criticism. As Compton notes, black Canadian
identity is not determined by "transplant Afrocentrism, easy access
African-Americana or the spice-rack vapidness of [Canadian] liberal
multiculturalism". Very little of the century and a half of work in Blues=
print
suffers from reactionaryism, misogyny or the banality of identity
politics. As an editor, Compton has wisely chosen to embrace writers
who name sexual and racial ambiguity, such as Braithwaite, Kathy Ann
March, Lily Spence and Andrea Thompson. Each of these authors
destabilizes white/black binarism and challenges sexual strictures"
within and without black community" -- the danforth review. =20

For many of us who feel estranged from mainstream politics, there are

went to the polls, we were negotiating the dangerous cross-currents of
neo-liberalism and neo-fascism - an assault on the poor and minority

This is great stuff you are thinking on and exploring, Steve.  The questions
of computer screen intervention in the combinations of image(colorized) and
text (poetic) is intriguing, particularly from a point of view such as
Benjamin's critique of art changing due to reproduction.  John Berger's
observations might be a next place to filter some of this through.  Thanks
for sharing all this insight.

Best Wishes,
Chris Murray

Subject: Re: Walter Benjamin & Color


Thank you, Murat, for this. The points you make about B & photography I
have always found intriguing. I believe there is a book on Proust and
photography, one of his frequent subjects in Remembrance... in which he
is remarkably lucid. I don't know if anyone has written on the
relationship of B and P on photography. It must be there (I don't have
the current time focus to uncover). But it's interesting to me how often
(unless I am vastly over-prejudiced here) the ways in which the lit crit
mind is vastly undereducated when it comes to the history of the visual
arts as a critical vocabulary - so that P and B on photography
historically, at least, get elided out of the reading experience and
critical discussion and of the text. (The opposite phenomena - the viz
people being often oblivious to the literary/poetry world and not able
to draw on imaginative language and practice as as a shaping influence -
is just as prevalent). Good filmmakers are perhaps the heroes here,
poly-dexterous with image, sound and text, etc.

I suspect/know the momentous change right now is in the joining of of
vocabularies that comes in the shared context of the computer screen -
where Benjamin's critical intelligence can be re-employed. What, for
example, constitutes "aura" on a monitor screen. Or, perhaps "that is"
the quest of the last x years on the part of artists and writers, how to
use the computer as a medium with a vocabulary that will create a sense
of authenticity, one that occupies the screen with the weight of an
original work in oil, pastel - or the punch of metal letter forms with
real ink.

Personally, for the last year, I have been working with antiquarian
books, journals and photographs in the Bancroft Library - primary
sources. It's been one of the mostly highly charged experiences I have
ever had (say, opening a unique version of a 1453 Brut Chronicle and
reading the velum inscribed, original story of King Leire).  Conversely,
when I see the digitized version of such ancient works up on a monitor,
the script looses a large part of its charge - it's an electronic
diminishment of value that counters the weight and textural feel of the
velum, the tangible, existential character of the scribe and his use of
ink, the smell, the heft of the substantial volume against the computer
monitor's sanitized, featherweight  apparition of the original which
becomes, for the casual viewer, much easier to dismiss as a temporary,
fleeting experience.

Yes, my experience is obviously a privileged and a rare one - yet one
that I do not see monitor technology able to surmount. Yet, I am sure
many on this list would argue that x, y and z web sites offer images and
text in a way that will knock you off your arse - and that many are
working on means to permit the computer to keep enhancing this
condition.    As well as others who see the computer as a great tool to
mediate experience back into the making of concrete objects of great
power via fantastic color printers, etc.

Yes, I think its powerful time of transition here in the medium (poetry)
of which we have chosen and Benjamin's work is critical to understanding
the moves from A to B and back to a transformed version of "A."

Back to my original query as to what happens to the critical text when -
using the computer technology - the writer is able to draw on images in
color and/or begins to change the color of its type fonts in the process
of writing. (Or, conversely, the significance when one refuses to draw
on the palette of this technology and stays in a b/w mode.   What
happens when we can see some version of "the color" of a work's
originating circumstance, say, the color images and calligraphy that
form the original journal format of a poem by Philip Whalen (one that
most of us might only know in a rather boring typographical rendition).
Or, an image that pops to mind, say, Barry Watten before giving a
lecture/reading at Berkeley, is checking out the PowerPoint program that
will bring up the architectural  photographs of Detroit that will
support "the architecture" of his performance.  Are the photographs
merely additional props for the ideas, or is the photographic content
(the aesthetics of the way the images are configured) implicit and
contiguous with the language he is speaking? What would be the
difference to the critical listening experience if Barry presented the
pictures in color (going back to Benjamin).

In terms of the employment of these new technologies, I suspect the
critical language/aestheics for distinguishing successful versus
mediocre (no aura) creative/critical practices and/or successes is just
beginning to more fully emerge.

I guess I am most interested in what way the absence of a quality - in
this
case color - creates in terms of dialog (critical &/or creative) between
what is absent and what is present in a work? What does, for example, an
absence  of color in Benjamin enable in his argument, and how does his
refusal  literally shade an argument in a particular direction (say,
"melancholy", David-Baptiste suggests.) What would happen if someone
literally went through Benjamin's texts covered them with transparent
multiple-color washes. Or - with Adobe Photoshop - took color to the
black
and white photographs of the original Paris Arcades to evoke the
original
period colors as taken from other sources.



Stephen,

I think there is another way of looking at colors, not as attributes but
as light. Given that fact black and white do not constitute an absence
(gray) but a particular play of light. Color in Benjamin is a play of
light/play of perception. Didn't Goethe say that colors have as much to
do with perception as "objective" reality.

It is true that Benjamin does not describe if something is red or blue,
but his thoughts on photography are commentaries on color. Dead babies
were common subjects in early photographs, which were drawn to static
objects because it took a long time to register light. Civil war
photographs of direct action are full of double exposures or blurs,
which give the special power to them (isn't that blur a color, a play of
light?). Many Civil War photos are of the peripheries of action -dead or
wounded soldiers, their possessions, a soldier on leave, etc. (I talk in
deatail about this in "The Peripheral Space of Photography.) This bias
in photography towards stasis, both in the taking and viewing, makes a
subversive melancholy part of photographic essence.

I am bringing in the subject of photography because Benjamin's writing
has the same qualities. It is not gray but black and white. For
instance, a quote in "The Arcades Project" functions exactly like a
photograph. It reflects (not states) a thought which the reader picks
and reflects upon: texts as reflections.

There were times when I thought Benjamin was completely wrong on a given
subject. In time, I realized that either I misunderstood him (always a
possibility with him) or did not see immediately see the profound
question he was raising, how he was far ahead of his time: for instance,
his concept of "ideal language" in relation to translation; or his
seeing photography as belonging to the age of mechanical reproduction,
while also referring to its aura. These two thoughts seem so
contradictory.

At the present, I am trying to understand how he sees "narrative," the
bete-noire of the last twenty years. There is no questions he envisions
a narrative which trascends the "bourgeois" prejudices we associate the
term with. A narrative of essences which, for example, the Taiwanese
director (T. T. T,?), the maker of "The Shainghai Flowers," etc.,
develops.

In my view, global capitalist world, the peculiar metrapolis,
communication system it creates, can not be understood without a
critical confrontation with Bejamin.Benjamin gives us clues for a
critique and artistic transcendance of that world -the analystic and
artistic means of doing so. His absolute understanding of the nature of
manifactured imagery must start any understanding of the nature of our
world.

Thanks again for your queries.

Does anyone know if there are places that do readings in the
environs of Portland, Maine?  After the Orono conference,
I'll be in the area for much of July, and wanted to plug into
the scene.

thanks,

Internationally recognized cultural theorist and creative writer,
and Santa Cruz resident Gloria Evangelina Anzald=C3=BAa, passed away on May=
 15
from diabetes-related complications.  She was 61 years old.  A versatile
author, Anzald=C3=BAa published poetry, theoretical essays, short stories,
autobiographical narratives, interviews, children's books, and multigenre
anthologies. As one of the first openly lesbian Chicana authors, Anzald=C3=
=BAa
played a major role in redefining contemporary Chicano/a and lesbian/queer
identities.  And as editor or co-editor of three multicultural anthologies,
Anzald=C3=BAa has also played a vital role in developing an inclusionary
feminist movement.
=09Anzald=C3=BAa is best known for Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza
(1987), a hybrid collection of poetry and prose which was named one of the
100 Best Books of the Century by both Hungry Mind Review and Utne Reader.
=09Anzald=C3=BAa's published works also include This Bridge Called My Back:
Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981), a ground-breaking collection of
essays and poems widely recognized by scholars as the premiere
multicultural feminist text; Making Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras:
Creative and Critical Perspectives by Feminists-of-Color (1990), a
multigenre collection used in many university classrooms; two bilingual
children's books--Friends from the Other Side/Amigos del otro lado (1993)
and Prietita and the Ghost Woman/ Prietita y la Llorona (1995);
Interviews/Entrevistas (2000), a memoir-like collection of interviews; and
this bridge we call home: radical visions for transformation (2002), a
co-edited collection of essays, poetry, and artwork that examines the
current status of feminist/womanist theorizing.  Anzald=C3=BAa has won nume=
rous
awards, including the Before Columbus Foundation American Book Award, the
Lamda Lesbian Small Book Press Award, an NEA Fiction Award, the Lesbian
Rights Award, the Sappho Award of Distinction, an NEA (National endowment
for the Arts) Fiction Award, and the American Studies Association Lifetime
Achievement Award.
=09Anzald=C3=BAa was born in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas in 1942,
the eldest child of Urbano and Amalia Anzald=C3=BAa.  She received her B.A.=
 from
Pan American University, her M.A. from University of Texas, Austin, and was
completing her doctorate at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  She
is survived by her mother, Amalia, her sister, Hilda, and two brothers:
Urbano Anzald=C3=BAa, Jr. and Oscar Anzald=C3=BAa; five nieces, three nephe=
ws,
eighteen grandnieces and grandnephews, a multitude of aunts and uncles, and
many close friends.
=09A public memorial will be planned at a later date.

                    The October Surprise Project

A call to poets to take part in the October Surprise project.

All around the nation, and the world as well, poets are speculating on
what Bush and his close supporters might undertake as an October
Surprise in order to remain in office.

I thought it would be very ineresting to invite poets to
come up with lists of possible October Surprises.

So you are invited to send us your concepts of possible October
Surprises.  Please send us your O.S.'s!!!
They can be prose, poetry, one-liners, a rhymned couplet or
quatrain, or a predictive statement of any kind and any length (but
please remember that brevity in the service of the O.S.
will be appreciated by the reader.) October Surprise ideas can be funny,
tragic, semi-tragic, prophetic, real world, surreal world or originated
from any world at all.

Remember they can be GOOD October Surprises as well as the opposite.

Please spread the word to all poets.

I will load submitted O.S. ideas onto the Woodstock Journal website
at woodstockjournal.com

The deadline for sending is May 31, 2004

Please send to edsanders@ulster.net
or to Box 729
Woodstock, NY 12498

Greetings friends, families, LOVER,

My friend and film maker Douglas Harmer of Cow Cud Productions and I (me) will be preparing texts, interviews and other materials/actions for a film we are doing, not necessarily about Baltimore Writers and their bretheren, but about writing in general, with a very humorous advantage: the film will include our texts, interviews, readings, atmospheres, etc. The film is a film about writing, but it's also a film about film making: the making of the film is tied in with the process of revision (textual revision) and there are many outtakes and bad takes that are going to be used, because, in an interview, I said "I think it's necessary for a text to show some kind of evidence of its revision process; 'absolute texts' - finished texts - are tyranical." I interview the film maker and the film maker is now on the spot. It is a self consciouss elucidation of the other side of the camera, the other side of the text. It will be a summer long project, and this e-mail is an unre vised e
 xplanation of the premises involved. Everyone is invited, pick a time, a drink, and a laugh.

Any questions? Write me. We're working on specifics. Perhaps YOU can shed some light on this project also.
The final version of the film will include a booklet with sketches, text, interviews, aphorisms, and an audio CD with readings, interviews, outtakes.

"I love you, but not that way."

Christophe Casamassima

Poetry looks retarded and shell-shocked when written
on a bus. Lick my strictures. Next time you travel,
stay at a CNN partner hotel. I think Fanny Howe would
make an excellent mother, figuratively speaking. John
Kenneth Galbraith used to sneak over to Pierre Elliot
Trudeau’s place at night. I’m not sure if I’m still in
Kaoshiung. You can tell he really cares because he is
sincere. About 300 million Indians live on less than a
dollar a day. Seafood smells like something’s wrong.
My standards are such that I’m guaranteed to change my
standards. Anvil rhymes with door in another language.
The baby on the airplane blew its nose into the
blanket. Clearly these philosophers are far from
impartial witnesses. It appears that I actually do not
want so much intensity. Jasmine grows well in direct
sunlight. The foot of the prostitute slides up Jesus’
inner thigh. No feeling is a direct match. We eat
sound for lack of space. Now I mix up more important
things. So alive she could never rebound. When you
look through the lens of appetite. Like dogs they say
we’re cleaner when we live outside ourselves. Looking
at things realistically means confronting cliché
head-on. I’ve always found community alienating. The
world built on a premise; she’s my daughter and I can
do what I want with her. The hobo makes a hobby of
movement, and then gets serious about it. Slip out of
bed at night. . .  the guilt of thinking. None of the
categories and methods I value are recognized by you.
Going back to waiting tables. But this isn't (supposed
to be) about you or me, it's about letting you know my
brother, whom you never met, is dead and that is all.
Hello Kitty exemplifies the ghost of an innocence
never its own, implanted young, implanted young. The
Bombay Stock Exchange recorded its biggest loss as the
new government has the provisional support of the
communist party. This place moves at enough
simultaneous speeds that I thought I would feel good,
comfortably lost, home. What worries you the most
about me? I mix up prozac and prosaic. I’ve sought the
emergence of positive values between the refusal of
aspects of my own culture (mind) and a rejection of
the tendencies of another. A home in writing. No more
than that of a sensory organ for perceiving psychical
qualities. There are infinite lines running from
stimulus to arousal, a kind of treadmill. Let us
pretend that you have an uncle who owns a fortune
cookie factory.  This uncle employs you to script the
messages to be printed on the small slips of paper
which are encased in individual cookies. To work an
honest day you are your mother. Scholars write
unwittingly about sadomasochistic sex. Can I wear your
army hat on the way there? Twelve hundred varieties of
bamboo, the majority endangered. Half of us are under
a different impression. Keep writing 'form' for
'from.' All ready things press us further than we want
to go. I’m really getting into reification these
days—especially in Chinese. What a dream. That would
make ZZ Top proud. Sarath ran through the Cambodian
jungle for three years before arriving in Edmonton. At
six years old I was amazed at his tree-climbing
ability. I used to get Robert and Jack Frost mixed up.
January rent? The cactus on the windowsill bloomed for
two days, half an inch of glass from the windchill.
Practice in twos. Christianity, or, dinner with your
parents. If my heart is unbecoming attacked. The
purpose of economic theory is to make those who are
comfortable feel comfortable. There is much to be said
and I am not the woman to say it. Late and hot I
entered finally nothing I - couldn’t - and now,
tending to matters hardly dissimilar to those
forgotten by most of the useless and forgotten.
Somewhere along the way I developed a sense that you
and things related to you seem true and real (and thus
surreal) while the rest of life is often dehumanizing
and crappy. I’ve lost all those years. Everyone is in
my own age bracket. Anyway, I'm fine and I wouldn't
expect you to have anything to say on the matter.
Please don't, in any way, feel obligated to respond;
people react weirdly to death, and it's awkward
feeling awkward about other people's understandable
awkwardness, etc. Like sandpaper to a mountain. You
can't even run in Taiwan, there's so many people
milling around, doing something. Words which the
ancient Greeks used to name beauty etymologically
meant pattern or proportion of parts. Never tell
yourself things. Bending, breaking. I want to let
everyone know that I'm an asshole because I’m so
sensitive. Looking like a giant lizard or a bored
child. Bukowski’s acne was so disturbing that he hid
outside in the bushes for his high school graduation.
We believe that the paradoxes of abstraction must make
their appearance in all communication more complex
than that of mood signals, and that without these
paradoxes the evolution of communication would be at
an end. Life would then be an endless interchange of
the objects of our current reality. There is a
distance from your insides to your outsides which is
as far as I can think without dreaming. I borrowed
this form from Ron Silliman who would make a good
father, figuratively speaking. The wind blew it off
while we were gone. Because it's got lots of roots.

Spain is a medium sized country that completed its youth 500 years ago by
expelling the jews and moors (1492)
enslaving and destroying the Americas (1492-1825) and exporting those riches
to Europe wherein all of European "progress'was financed by the booty.Please
do not try to say Europe has Moral Superiority, it does not; a generation
ago Europe killed the jews, ruled colonial empires, slaughtered people in
Russia for thinking and more.  I would put all the horrors that Americans
have committed, and there are many up against all the horrors of Europe who
has done worse? We are all benefiting from exploitation.

Europeans on the whole despise their muslim populations, Romano Prodi,
president of Europe only the other day said that the entrance of Eastern
European nations would rebalance Europe as a continent out of the Christian
tradition. Until very recently a 'german'from Brazil could get a German
passport because of blood while a Turk who lived in Germany for 40 years
could not. Go to the suburbs of Paris or Rome or Berlin and ask those Muslim
populations if they are treated well? I venture to guess that my Pakistani
neighbors here in Chicago are treated much better and are less harrassed
even today.

Europe and the US are part of the same world-wide exploitive system.  Who do
you think finances all those 30 day vacations and 'free' socialized
medicine? Exploitation is not just an American problem. Americans exploit
Latin Americans and Europeans Exploit Africans and others this is the reason
we are rich and the rest of the world is poor. Europe has not moral
superiority the Europeans did not invade Iraq because it was not in their
interests to do so it had nothing to do with Morality.

I also must say that while did not agree with Bush on Iraq we have to admit
that we are in  war right now to decide what kind of world-view will
succeed. While I totally reject Bush's means I do not believe that the
Islamic Fundamentalism represented by Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden and the rest
is preferable to western democracy. With all its problems would anyone trade
our current flawed system for Saudi Arabia's

We are engaged in a spiral of death, beheadings, abuse of prisoners,
violence, murder, what we need is not screaming or yelling but quiet,
prophetic responses to all this violence. We need a Ghandi, or Saladin or St
Francis someone who can see through all of this and remove the moral
authority from those who have chosen the road of death. the answer to all
this pain and death is to realize that we cannot go on as a world where
Americans, Europeans and Japanese live like kings while the rest of the
world gets only crumbs.  But someone needs to challenge all of this in a non
violent way because September 11th is just the beginning of the pain that
this death spiral is causing.

Cutting the Timber

A man lay down across the threshold of the kitchen outside, head within.
He was to represent the saw. Two players now took hold of his feet
outside, while two others caught his head and shoulders in the kitchen.
They pulled against one another, forward and backwards, as if they were
sawing wood, until one pair proved too strong for the other.

Annie, Steven and all, these questions regarding form and content are someth=
ing
I deal w/ at length in my new book _Emancipating Pragmatism_.  As Duncan arg=
ued
long ago now, the Black Mountain preoccupation w/ the relationship between t=

arises from their interest in William James, Dewey & Kenneth Burke.  Here's =
a
short excerpt from my book (some of which will be out of context...):

*********************
The following is one of Burke=EDs more lucid descriptions of language as sym=
bolic
action, in regard to poetry:

The general approach to the poem might be called =ECpragmatic=EE in this=
 sense: It
assumes that a poem=EDs structure is to be described most accurately by thin=
king

=ECdo
something=EE for the poet and his readers, and that we can make the most rel=
evant
observations about its design by considering the poem as the embodiment of t=
his
act=D6this pragmatic view of the poem=D6through the emphasis upon the act pr=
omptly
integrates considerations of =ECform=EE and =ECcontent.=EE


Burke=EDs =ECpragmatic view of the poem=EE has as its antecedent Dewey=EDs s=
tipulation
that =ECin the act [of writing] there is no distinction between, but perfect
integration of manner and content, form and substance.=EE I note this not to
privilege Dewey over Burke via his =ECoriginality=EE but simply as a way of
pointing out that the concept of language as symbolic action which Ellison
found so useful might be located in Dewey=EDs work as well.  Why is this
important?  The answer has to do with the way the concept of symbolic action
=ECintegrates considerations of =EBform=ED and =EBcontent.=ED=EE  As Burke=
 explains in the
quote above, when one speaks of symbolic action there is a presumption that
motives (political, social, psychological, economic) are manifested in desig=
n.
What might be considered merely =ECcontent=EE (say, a political point of vie=
w)
according to another paradigm has, according to pragmatism, formal
consequences.  Conversely (and this is equally important), *form* (syntax,
grammar, poetics) is considered as *a kind of content*, as socially
substantive, as having, potentially, a social function. Burke, Dewey, and
Ellison are all in agreement on this point.

Dewey considers philosophy in the same way that Burke considers the poem: as=
 a
particular kind of *motivated* discourse.  He assumes, that is, that a
philosophical discourse, one of Emerson=EDs for instance, is designed to do
something, and he considers that discourse =ECas the embodiment of that act.=
=EE
Dewey insists that philosophy is not a form of objective or abstract knowled=
ge
but rather =ECa form of desire, of effort at action.=EE  Thus if Emerson=
 writes, as
he does in =ECMontaigne,=EE =ECthe philosophy we want is one of fluxions and
mobility=EE (CW 4:160), Dewey wouldn=EDt hesitate to relate this to Emerson=
=EDs
political desires, his interest in =ECthe strivings of men to achieve democr=
acy=EE
and his contemporaneous agitation in favor of Emancipation.  He would, in al=
l
likelihood, point out that Emerson here construes philosophy as a *desire* -
not a written transcription of an abstract truth but something we =ECwant.=
=EE
Moreover, he would find in Emerson=EDs style - his =ECparagraphs incomprehen=
sible=EE
- similar motivations: a will toward unpredictability in the name of
experimentation and invention.  What this has to do specifically with
sustaining egalitarian politics and democratic institutions I will make more
explicit in Chapter Two.  Emerson theorized that the strivings of people to
achieve democracy in America was predicated on the ability to revise the
definition of America and the definitions at work in its founding documents.
There needed to be, in Emerson=EDs words, a =ECbelief [among Americans] that=
 as the
people have made a government, they can make another=EE (JMN11:406).  And th=
is
belief could best be fostered by a corresponding belief that the generation =
and
maintenance of meaning was an unpredictable and ongoing affair.

  Subject: Spearating Bush from the Real Issue


  Spain is a medium sized country that completed its youth 500 years ago =
by
  expelling the jews and moors (1492)
  enslaving and destroying the Americas (1492-1825) and exporting those =
riches
  to Europe wherein all of European "progress'was financed by the =
booty.Please
  do not try to say Europe has Moral Superiority, it does not; a =
generation
  ago Europe killed the jews, ruled colonial empires, slaughtered people =
in
  Russia for thinking and more.  I would put all the horrors that =
Americans
  have committed, and there are many up against all the horrors of =
Europe who
  has done worse? We are all benefiting from exploitation.

  Europeans on the whole despise their muslim populations, Romano Prodi,
  president of Europe only the other day said that the entrance of =
Eastern
  European nations would rebalance Europe as a continent out of the =
Christian
  tradition. Until very recently a 'german'from Brazil could get a =
German
  passport because of blood while a Turk who lived in Germany for 40 =
years
  could not. Go to the suburbs of Paris or Rome or Berlin and ask those =
Muslim
  populations if they are treated well? I venture to guess that my =
Pakistani
  neighbors here in Chicago are treated much better and are less =
harrassed
  even today.

  Europe and the US are part of the same world-wide exploitive system.  =
Who do
  you think finances all those 30 day vacations and 'free' socialized
  medicine? Exploitation is not just an American problem. Americans =
exploit
  Latin Americans and Europeans Exploit Africans and others this is the =
reason
  we are rich and the rest of the world is poor. Europe has not moral
  superiority the Europeans did not invade Iraq because it was not in =
their
  interests to do so it had nothing to do with Morality.

  I also must say that while did not agree with Bush on Iraq we have to =
admit
  that we are in  war right now to decide what kind of world-view will
  succeed. While I totally reject Bush's means I do not believe that the
  Islamic Fundamentalism represented by Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden and the =
rest
  is preferable to western democracy. With all its problems would anyone =
trade
  our current flawed system for Saudi Arabia's

  We are engaged in a spiral of death, beheadings, abuse of prisoners,
  violence, murder, what we need is not screaming or yelling but quiet,
  prophetic responses to all this violence. We need a Ghandi, or Saladin =
or St
  Francis someone who can see through all of this and remove the moral
  authority from those who have chosen the road of death. the answer to =
all
  this pain and death is to realize that we cannot go on as a world =
where
  Americans, Europeans and Japanese live like kings while the rest of =
the
  world gets only crumbs.  But someone needs to challenge all of this in =
a non
  violent way because September 11th is just the beginning of the pain =
that
  this death spiral is causing.

BLEEP THE PRESS: CAMERA MOVED OFF POWELL DURING RUSSERT GRILLING; AIDE
ATTEMPTED TO CUT OFF INTERVIEW
Sun May 16 2004 10:45:35 ET
**Exclusive Details**

An aide to Sec. of State Colin Powell ordered a halt to a MEET THE PRESS
interview and directed a camera to shoot a palm tree during provocative
questioning by host Tim Russert!

Powell was being interview by satellite from Jordan.

State Department press aide Emily Miller fumed as Tim Russert went beyond
the 10 minutes allotted for the NBC Sunday session.

MORE

13 minutes in to the interview, Miller attempted to pull the plug.

As Russert grilled Powell on his presentation at the UN of Iraq's alleged
WMDs -- Miller moved the single remote camera off Powell.

"You're off," Miller announced.

"I am not off," Powell warned.

"No. They can't use it, they're editing it..." Miller said on an open
microphone.

"Emily, get out of the way.  Bring the camera back please," the secretary
snapped.

MORE

Russert aired the exchange unedited.

Powell was 45 minutes late to the taping, a top source explained.

NBC's MEET THE PRESS joined in progress....

TIM RUSSERT:  Finally, Mr. Secretary, in February of 2003, you placed your
enormous personal credibility before the United Nations and laid out a
case against Saddam Hussein, citing.

(Camera moved off of interview subject)

EMILY MILLER, STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS AIDE: You're off.

SECRETARY POWELL:  I am not off.

EMILY MILLER, PRESS AIDE:  No. They can't use it, they're editing it.

SECRETARY POWELL:  He's still asking the questions.

EMILY MILLER, PRESS AIDE: He was not ...

SECRETARY POWELL:  Tim, I am sorry I lost you.

MR. RUSSERT:  I am right here Mr. Secretary.  I would hope they would put
you back on camera.  I don't know who did that.

EMILY MILLER, PRESS AIDE:  He was going to go for another five minutes.

SECRETARY POWELL:  We've really scre...

MR. RUSSERT:  I think that was one of your staff Mr. Secretary.  I don't
think that's appropriate.

SECRETARY POWELL:  Emily, get out of the way.  Bring the camera back
please. (Camera returns to the interview subject) I think we're back on
Tim, go ahead with your last question.

MR. RUSSERT:  Thank you very much, sir.

In February of 2003, you put your enormous personal reputation on the line
before the United Nations and said that you had solid sources for the case
against Saddam Hussein.  It now appears that an agent called "Curve Ball"
had misled the CIA by suggesting that Saddam had trucks and trains that
were delivering biological chemical weapons.

How concerned are you that some of the information you shared with the
world is now inaccurate and discredited?

SECRETARY POWELL:  I'm very concerned.  When I made that presentation in
February 2003, it was based on the best information that the Central
Intelligence Agency made available to me.  We studied it carefully.  We
looked at the sourcing and the case of the mobile trucks and trains.
There was multiple sourcing for that.  Unfortunately, that multiple
sourcing over time has turned out to be not accurate, and so I'm deeply
disappointed.

But I'm also comfortable that at the time that I made the presentation it
reflected the collective judgment, the sound judgment, of the intelligence
community, but it turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong
and, in some cases, deliberately misleading.  And for that I'm
disappointed, and I regret it.

MR. RUSSERT:  Mr. Secretary, we thank you very much for joining us again
and sharing your views with us today. SECRETARY POWELL:  Thanks, Tim.

(END OF PRE-TAPE INTERVIEW)

MR. RUSSERT:  AND THAT WAS AN UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH THE SECRETARY OF

Prisoners of their own literary success
Issue of whether inmate authors deserve royalties

book, "Couldn't Keep it to Myself," is a collection of stories by female
inmates in a Connecticut prison. (AP / Carla M. Cataldi)

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Ever since eight inmates at the York Correctional
Institution became award-winning authors, they've been prisoners of their
own success.

Their anthology, Couldn't Keep It to Myself: Testimonies From Our
Imprisoned Sisters, published in 2003, was a hit that brought them
unexpected notoriety and another day in court. The compilation of stories,
composed during a writing class taught at the prison in Niantic, Conn.,
offered readers insight into the criminal justice system, as well as the
sexual abuse, violence, drugs, alcoholism and poverty that shape many
inmates' lives before they get to prison.

But as soon as it was released controversy erupted over whether inmates
should be allowed to profit from work done in prison. So the state sued to
garnish the royalties each prisoner received.

"It was the publication of the book that really complicated things," said
best-selling author Wally Lamb, who coached and edited the women's writing
workshop. "There was a defeatism that really injected the women."

In April, the Department of Correction temporarily halted the writing
program after learning that one inmate, Barbara Parsons Lane, who has been
incarcerated since 1996 on a manslaughter conviction, won a $25,000 US
prize from the PEN American Center for work that was featured in the book.

"We were extremely disappointed to learn there had been this negative
reaction inside the prison. It seemed like a real lost opportunity at York
when there was limelight to be shared by everybody," PEN Director Larry
Siems said.

The prison's reaction to the success of its own rehabilitative program was
confusing to Lamb.

"They felt that they had told their truth and taken the risk of sharing
that with strangers, and had done something worthwhile. It was
discouraging to have the state react the way it did," said Lamb, author of
She's Come Undone and I Know This Much Is True.

The program is now back up and running after news of the shutdown made
headlines, although Lamb was not able to meet with the women this year
until April 23. When classes resumed the women were pleased to discover
that computer files containing personal writing that they thought had been
destroyed by prison officials could be recovered from a backup file.

It will take time to rebuild the program and the women's trust, but the
process has begun, Lamb said.

"At long last, the Department of Correction not only sees the value of the
program, but has now gotten behind it," he said.

It was Lamb's connections to the book that caused Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal concern. He worried Lamb would help the book become a best
seller and make it a moneymaker for the women. The state wanted to avoid
helping prisoners profit from their crimes and incarceration. When it
became apparent the book's royalties wouldn't be huge, the state settled
its case, he said.

"Bringing the action certainly was within the authority to enforce the
law. But at the same time this settlement recognizes that the book was not
a cornucopia of financial riches," Blumenthal said.

The state went to court last year seeking to seize the book's royalties at
a rate of $117 a day. The effort was made under a law that permits the
state to recover incarceration costs from inmates.

As it turns out, each of the women is entitled to $5,600 from publisher
Harper Collins following release from prison.

The settlement between the state and the women will see the prisoners each
paying the state $500. The York writing program will receive $3,500 and
another $500 will be paid to the state Department of Mental Health and
Addiction Services.

Victims' rights advocates see the settlement as an affront. Dee Parsons,
whose son was murdered in 1994, said Blumenthal caved under pressure from
Department of Correction Commissioner Theresa Lantz and Lamb.

"It's not about vengeance. None of these women did anything to me. It's a
question of what's right. They have the time to do this. Our survivors
don't have the time to write a book," said Parsons, former president of
the Connecticut chapter of Survivors of Homicide.

"It's very unfair. I'm devastated by the fact the state changed their
mind," she said.

Lantz stands by the program and looks forward to its rebuilding, said
Department of Correction spokesman Brian Garnett. "It's back in session
and we're moving forward," he said.

The stories in the women's book do not deal directly with the crimes the
women committed. A bill now before the Connecticut legislature would
revise Connecticut's "Son of Sam" law -- named after the New York killer
who tried to sell his memoirs -- to allow the state to distinguish between
inmates making money from a skill learned in prison and from those who try
to profit from the crime they committed.

Lamb said the women didn't mean to cause such controversy. They are now
wary of bringing attention to themselves by being too successful, he said.

The women used the writing class to dig deep into their emotions,
examining the situations and choices in their lives that had taken them to
prison, and coming to terms with responsibility for their actions, he
said.

Lane's daughter, Andrea Graham, who accepted the PEN award in New York
City on April 12 on her mother's behalf, said writing the book has been
therapeutic for her mother.

"She's definitely a different person," Graham said. "It's given her the
therapy to become more the person she is."

WORKSHOPS

ANNOUNCING A SUMMER WORKSHOP WITH POET JORGE GUITART

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I worked 26 1/2 years for the State of Connecticut. When I learned about
this situation, it didn't surprise me at all. It's typical of the way State
government works. Practices such as these occur on a daily basis. Obviously,
the state's attorney general discussed the former inmates' prospective
royalties with literary people who have no idea of how much authors earn. It
sends a message to prisoners that no successful rehabilitation will go
unpunished.  At the moment, I think Connecticut looks as foolish as Florida
did after the 2000 election.

We have only the discourse for the conceptual frame, and within this
frame, the ability to organize at least the appearance of factual
substance, substantiating an interpretation which must allow for an
element of unpredictability less and less precise. Wouldn't you rather
listen to music? They are upstairs. What about this hour. What makes
this hour any different than the one before or the one following after
the words cease being written, wanting to be. They want to become
something, substance, material, formed. How can processes be the
object of a discourse? The processes are those the writing attempts to
perceive, identify, expose. There is no space in such a discourse for
intangible referents, traces of meaning trailing off. Language happens
at those edges, where the referent dissolves. Or there might be a
narrative, some sequence of events told one way or another, one after
another or collapsed within one another, superimposed temporalities,
shifting planes on which multiple and disconnected events appear for
only as long as a glance, to the side, off to the side, the
peripheries' abandonments unmarking wide oscillations among barely
perceptible points of departure. Parallel, simultaneity and side by
side proliferating layers manifest their texts, designating a
discursive function towards processes other than the construction of
the text itself, which can never be said to be made entirely of
itself, its own contents. Discontented, they were said to have formed
themselves on these grounds, protesting, at an originating site of
disobedience. Those were streets that were once occupied. They still
are, there still are, people, in them, circulating. Does too much
circulate without determinate trajectories? Do you have to know where
each word is going? The fatefulness of the arbitrary, and pleasure in
random rhythms, flows, resisting sequence, though each sentence
establishes the expectation that one will be able to finish it and
proceed to the next, and after that, the next. When the book to be
cited begins to disappear, and there remains only the gesture towards
one or another book, multiplying, without an object, without any
textual object at all, without sequence, or semblance, if that is
possible, how can it be possible to make a writing that would refuse
to resemble even the world, the purely imaginary world, that writing
wishes to construct? There is no journalism here, where the writing
turns away from the world, the discursive paradigms for comprehending
the present time. Neither can the language go back in time. Those
books, their languages, their centuries, their locations, distend in
the non-space of the rotating planes multiplying without center, core,
gravity, weight point. As though so many spaces could be projected
unattached to their turning point, and attain an irreducible matter
and duration, however momentary they happen to be glimpsed. Why
couldn't that, also, operate, narrate, conceptualize, reproducing
temporal modes emptied of their appeal to that other logic,
relentlessly fictive, which demands coherent locations, and actors
occupying them. There is no stage for them to occupy. Read a reference
to a building or street or interior, leaving the avenues to the
traffic on them, turning into the interior, which could be anywhere.
These events that are simulated transpire everywhere, and they are
reproducible, obstinately without reference to any other materiality
than their potential to reproduce. The interior is notable for its
protection from the boulevards, the market forces in conflict there,
the struggle for survival pitched as contention, helplessly abstract.
"War is a celebration of markets," etc.

Spaces protract in the interior, multiple exact duplicates tempering
shine. Glimmer. Shop lights. Where all the time there is no time. One
day or another intervenes, one hour to the next undergoes an
interruption, soundcast, something happening somewhere. Don't you want
to know what it is? But we can't know, and we don't know, and that
demands attention, such an experience of equivalence, the edges of
times and places blurring, even their sound, their protests, muted by
their manifold resemblances, duplicating the removal from which they
are viewed. The interior is the language. Books construct this. One
book works though other books, assembling the substance heard in
passing and that substance, the materiality, is always heard as
passing. To make a writing for which there is no place, no boundary
markers, no territory to be staked, an endlessly evaporating amalgam
of traces for markers that cancel each other simultaneous to their
entrance into a circuit of meaning, designating more than themselves,
refusing to be reduced, refusing almost to be read. For the eventual
reading each text projects, that aspect includes the tactic of the
counter-narrative, where there is no history to be rearranged in a
progress from thesis to demonstration culminating in the assertion of
knowledge and object. Such a projection might invoke the belief that
there is an outside. Rather let the combinations spiral nowhere in
particular, moving across a temporality of their own making, inured to
design, repetition, enforcements. That, also, is a wall.

Instead of torturing, humiliating, and murdering Muslim prisoners, we =
should institute poetry workshops which teach prisoners how to write =

Are you planning on going to Burning Man this year, and can I pick your

I like your suggestion!  But why do you think they should write Confessional
Poetry?  Don't you think they'd be more into ghazals and such like? Or are
the poems supposed to be a source of intelligence gathering, for example
what I have done below.  (This is the worst "poem" I can write).  By the
way, I am not planning any terrorism at any time!  I am inspired by
Plathsexton at her worst...  (You will see that I dislike the gratuitous sez
and violence and exhibitionist suicidality)I expect I shouldn't mail this as
it will offend everyone!  Aaargh.  But I am so sick of 9/11 being a subject
only Republicans can allude to and then they do it in religious unfunny
solemnity...

The Enemy Combattants Confessional Poem

    Oh America, you Fathercountry
    of my enemies.  How I long
    to stick my dong
    into your tall, phallic buildings
    but, praise Allah, I meant it
    only metaphorically
    as airplanes have
    a sausagelike, penile form
    akin to that of bullets
    (and the green and yellow pills
    I took in my sixth suicide attempt,
    Curse Dr. Y, that Father-Fuhrer
    who didn't trim my neurosess
    like tulips on Park Avenue,
    decapitated before they can rot and
    spread their gangrenous grim-reaper's
    underarm sweat odor), and
    following this lethal synmetry,
    they kill the infidel
    on August 27th at 10:15am
    in New York,
    on Centre Street.
    then, the blood of your people
    will run down limbs like the menses
    of a virgin, rich and full of iron.  By the
    way, I hate you so much
    that it goes full-circle into love
    much as the hater longs to rape the object of his hatred
    but in so doing, cruelly puppets the act
    of heterosexual paternalistic love,
    lthis mandela-cycle imitates
     the eternal cycle of the seasons
    mediated by Hades (that rapist slave-master-sinner
    who stole stauch Persephone from Demeter,
    her dear mother.)  Therefore,
    my lovervictimfathermother,
    here is a list of my co-conspirators

Bush's college grades were published in the New Yorker during the 2000
election season.  I recall a C in government.  He had mostly C's, and the
B's were in things like astronomy which I assume was a git course for
nonscience students.

What I don't understand is why he was popular and a frat leader, etc.  I
would have thought that the students at Yale would be intelligent (and
liberal at that time!) and thus they wouldn't have anything in common with
W.  I mean, when I was in college we talked about books & math & computers &
writing etc. more than about becoming the leader of the free world, sent by
God to democratixze the universe...

But then again, I didn't go to Yale.  I vistied Yale as a high school
student, and the place was so creepy I didn't apply.  The interviewer
actually asked "With abstruse interests such as yours, do you have any
friends?"  I knew someone who was half-Japanese who got asked "Do you date
Japanese girls or American girls?" in HIS Yale interview, so I assume that
asking rude questions was policy, not the quirks of a few bad apples...

the time at the end of this writing
Paolo Javier
Ahadada Books, 2004

"Paolo Javier's confident, emotionally variable poems work at a point where sensory information runs into the artistic reality of building and negotiating surfaces. But instead of giving in to one force or the other they inhabit the mess that collision makes, insisting that art and life remain tangled up. "I don't want to be another story, you know?" one asks, knowing story is part of the deal of moving through time at all. These are perceptive poems; that there is pleasure despite it all in never knowing what might happen next is no small part of what they know."

- Anselm Berrigan, author of 'Zero Star Hotel' (Edge Books)


"One of Paolo Javier’s poems is four words: “the words/the spaces”.  In  The Time At The End Of This Writing, the words are ahead of the time they’re in at present—throughout. Paolo Javier makes words be beside images or beside spaces—equality and separation of space and image and word that’s a 3D sculpture wherein the courting lover always in bed and out in NYC flies up to his intended and appears to be Paolo Javier (translated as say Berrigan). By the end of the writing, that person is apparently someone over fifty with some other given life in place (whereas Paolo Javier is young, in his twenties), the someone over fifty not a character or “voice” as ventriloquism but ventriloquism of space and words that undo and at once heighten the previous spaces new like pressing the lips to the page."

- Leslie Scalapino, author of 'Zither & Autobiography’ (Wesleyan University Press)


"Hip, sexy, energetic, Paolo Javier gives mad respect to his artistic and poetic predecessors in 'The Time At The End Of This Writing'.  His voice is clear and tender, these poems controlled in disruptions of narrative, never falling into obscure terrain. They are skillfully crafted and tight, a pleasure to roll off the tongue and view on the page. This Original Brown Boy has given us a lovely and fierce collection of poems that dismantle how ethnic writers in North America are expected to write. It's about time."

- Barbara Jane Reyes, author of 'Gravities of Center' (Arkipelago Books)


"Paolo Javier may end his book by "submitting” to Rilke, Neruda and Berrigan. But not with
a bowed head. He submits to Poetry's Call and deservedly ascends the crowded shelves
with his first book equal to those whose works he imbibed, but then alchemized into his
history as a poet. His history as the "Original Brown Boy" Poet. By forming original poems,
Javier subverts the colonialism that imposed a language upon his ancestors. He does so by
finding the gold not previously found by other poets whose first language is English.
Piquant, passionate, perky, panting, "pointy" Paolo-poems result from Javier's refusal to
"lament the decisions that made me." In no uncertain English terms, Paolo dares, "Fuck
me." Which is to say, Fuck lineage -- dismissively as well as lovingly."

- Eileen Tabios, author of 'Reproductions From An Empty Flagpole’ (Marsh Hawk)

i think this is a GREAT poem; it reminds me of one
a kent johnson's miseries of poetry. maybe we
should all do our "worst." "How I long
                                        to stick my dong"...

and it only gets better from there. somebody
should bring this to the attention of michael
moore.

Hello,

Hope you’re well and enjoying the sun.

Next week I’m turning 27, and I’m also celebrating the
release of my first book!!!

Please come to one of my book/birthday parties on MAY
27th or May 29th (details below).

Bring yourself! Bring a smile!
I’ll provide the wine and the bad jokes.
Who knows? Maybe you’ll bump into a cute poet and
start a spring fling!
Anything can happen.

It’ll be lovely.
Hope to see you soon.

best,
Ishle

meeting girlfriends, Korean comfort women, and .44s
shot from rooftops in
Brooklyn, Park lays bare the ruined heart of a city
still pulsing with light.

Program &
Institute, NYU, Rutgers Korean Students Association

Ron,

Know anyone who goes in for high-toned satire?

Annette
========================================
 Greetings, Global Billionaires-

 I'm the chair of the Creative Content Team for the Billionaires'
national
Web site. Our current major project is the Billionaires News Network
(BNN),
which is set to start is June. The news service will publish news
commentary
and satire, as well as regular Op(ulent)-Ed columns on the national site
as
well as via email. I'm writing to invite all Billionaires world-wide to
join
the creative team and bring your local perspective to BNN.

There are two areas to work on:

 News Satire: A BNN news pundit scans the national headlines, looking
for a
story or two of interest to B4B.  He or she then writes a short (300
word)
introduction putting a Billionaire spin on the story, followed by a link
to
the actual news story. Each pundit chooses a specific day of the week to
scan the headlines, and commit to writing his blurb for that day. This
is a
once-a-week commitment.

Op(ulent)-Ed Columns: The BNN columnists write a medium-length essay
(500-1000 words) twice a month. You are encouraged to create a specific
Billionaire personality (The Texas Oilman, The Rich Widow) or write in a
specific format (ie, Miss Manners, The Ethicist). This is a
twice-a-month
commitment.

I would love to have contributors from all of our chapters. If you are
interested in joining the team, or have questions about BNN, drop me a
line!

Owen Dwight Howse, aka Don Rider
owen@billionairesforbush.com


P.S. BNN isn't the only project we have in the works. If you have
another
idea for the Web site, or would like to work on another project, let me
know. We're always looking for writers, researchers, web and flash
designers, and programmers.

Alright folks,

After thinking about it, here's an updated version of the web-hosting offer
I made last month...

In an effort to raise some much needed money for upcoming publishing
projects, I'm offering a special deal for web-hosting at durationpress.com.

This package includes 10MB of disk space & ftp access, & the URL will have
durationpress.com/ as a prefix (there is no domain hosting for this offer).

What I've decided to do is offer this for a one-time setup fee of $25.

All signups must be made by the end of this month, & payments must be
received in a reasonable amount of time (don't want to get burned here).

If needed, I might be persuaded to throw together a template or two for
those needing help with design.

All questions can be made backchannel to jshiroma@durationpress.com

Sorry but this kind of sloppy thinking makes me cringe =85 May I remind you
that the Welfare State is also financed by taxes and different kinds of
compulsory social security systems? At a time when privatization of former
common goods is becoming a strong global trend, I wonder who would trade
the European system for America's=20

Also, wouldn't it be fair to reproduce Romano Prodi's full statement before
accusing him of despising Europe's muslim populations? Here it is:

"A new Europe built on the fundamental values that have fashioned it in the
course of its history, which also have their roots in the Christian
tradition, offers benefits for everyone, whatever their philosophical or
spiritual tradition.

As we lay the foundations of a new, enlarged European Union it would not be
right to marginalise the religions and movements that have contributed, and
are still contributing, so much to the culture and humanism that Europe is
rightly so proud of.

That does not mean failing to recognise or denigrating the need for a
secular state and a secular Europe. It simply means taking account of
Europe's roots, which lie in religious and spiritual movements as well as
in humanism, the enlightenment and the Greek and Roman heritage.

Recognising these roots does not signal rejection or exclusion of others.
Europe's true strength has always lain in mingling and coalescing different
influences and cultures.

How can we put Christianity, Judaism and Islam in separate boxes in a
Europe that proclaims its pluralism and tolerance?

The separation of the public and religious spheres does not mean denying or
ignoring religions and their many believers.

I believe that an open, healthy debate between the Community institutions
and religious confessions is now both possible and necessary. In fact the
Commission's White Paper on European governance mentions the need for the
participation of religious groups and consultations with them."

DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE
Sponsored by Stanford Continuing Studies
Supported by Undergraduate Research Programs

Running Through Fire: How I Survived the Holocaust
by Zosia Goldberg as Told to Hilton Obenzinger

with

Kay Kostopoulos and Audrey Dundee Hannah
of the Stanford Drama Department

Thursday, May 20th
7:30PM

Cubberley Auditorium
FREE

 From the Introduction by Paul Auster:

I thought fast. I was lucky and got an idea. These two short sentences come
toward the end of Zosia Goldbergs remarkable account of how she managed to
live through the nightmare years of the Second World War, and they
encapsulate the spirit of the entire story she tells us. Like a female
Odysseus, this beautiful and resourceful young woman needed more than
simple courage to overcome the dangers that surrounded her. Survival
demanded cunning, quick thinking under pressure, a ferocious will to adapt
to the most frightening and intolerable conditions, and sheer dumb luck....

RUNNING THROUGH FIRE is a book filled with unspeakable horrors but it is
told without a shred of self-pity. Zosia Goldberg never complains, never
bemoans her lot. She battles and endures, and in this raw, unvarnished tale
of human suffering, she has given us a manual of hope.


 From Library Journal:

An account of deep personal heroism ... as suspenseful as any novel....
This work shows how a strong, resourceful woman (with a lot of luck)
overcame the grisly odds.

Dear Stephen,

Sorry not to have answered you sooner due to a leg infection.

Your point about how the critical mind is unaware of the language of visual=20
arts, and the reverse, is very much to the point. When literary critics talk=
=20
about visual poetry they think essentially in terms of moderism concrete poe=
try,=20
a touch of Appolinaire, etc. They are not attempt to integrate the huge=20
impact of manifactured images on our consciousness. That is a different proc=
ess=20
which requires an understanding of both what image and light are. When are t=
hey=20
the same (then containing the potential for chaos and aura) and when are the=
y=20
not? My book "The Peripheral Space of Photography" (Green Integer) deals wit=
h=20
that issue. Photography has a crucial place in this development; it appears=20=
the=20
first mechanical medium of production, but, due to the difficulty of=20
controlling the movement of light, it is not.

What is the difference between the photographic image and digital image?

Film has a fascinating place in this development. Begun as the medium of=20
"moving image," film had a "countermovement" turning to the static state of=20
photography. Already implicit in German expressionist films like Dr Mabusse=20=
(just=20
out in DVD) or Dreyer's "Joan of Arc," this movement began more explicit wit=
h=20
Italian neo-realists, Orson Wells, Bresson, etc. I have just written a piece=
 for=20
Benjamin Hollander's poem "Vigilance," which Beyond Baroque is publishing=20
this year, which deals partly with the above issue.

To see the connections, and gaps, between word and image is, I think, how to=
=20
come out of the inside-beltway feel a lot of our literary arguments have.

Michel:

1) The European Welfare state was created because after World War II
American taxpayers paid for huge standing armies that allowed European
states to shift resources from the military to welfare while being defended
from the Russians. This continues the US spends many times more on European
defence than European states do and this should end why couldn't Europe stop
the genocide in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Croatia?

The European social system exists because for 500 years Europeans plundered
the world and became rich.

Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Slavery, European Colonialism in Africa these were not
America's doing it was estimated by Edoardo Galeano that 45% of all the
wealth in Europe rightfully belongs to Latin Americans.

 The wealth that made Cambridge, Oxford, The Sorbonne, Bologna, Salamanca,
and most European Educational and other institutions, museums, companies
began its life in the Americas and Africa, this is not Sloppy thinking, go
to Potosi or Mexico or the Congo and tell me it is not so.

 We Americans have been plundering for a mere 200 years do not try to tell
us that you have no role in these injustices because you do the entire
developed world is using someone else's money.

2) The fact is that you ignored my main point. Why is it that Muslim
populations in Europe are still, 40 years later not integrated and one of
the US's leading generals in Iraq is an Arab American? Why is it that an
Arab American can run for president (Ralph Nader)and no one attacks him for
being foreign? Why is it that a headscarf is a major issue in France?
The reason is because what defines a European in most of Europe is what you
were born this is more important than what you assent to.

3) Europe does not hold the monopoly on the traditions of Christianity,
Judaism, Greece, Rome, the Enlightenment there are millions of American who
are opposed to Bush and what he is doing and we will have our chance in
November to remove him from office because we have a liberal democratic
republic here which is no more flawed than a republic that has Fascists in
the Government (Italy), or a Fascist who won 15% of the presidental vote
(France, LePen)or many other anomolies.

4) Americans believe in open healthy debate but we do not define who we are
by our Religion, inspite of what Mr Bush says, we are defined by the fact
that the only royal 'we'used here is coupled with the People.

I cringe at being lectured as well we are all culpable we all need to change
the way we personally live if we want to change the world.

I might note that Europe is hardly the only place where a headscarf is a major
issue -- Just today CNN carrries a story of a final court resoultion to yet
another "can we wear headscarves in our chools" fracas right here in the USA --
and no, Nader isn't denounced as a foreigner, but many Arab-Americans have been
denounced as foreigners,,,,  How many American voters do you really think even
know that Nader is of Arabic background?

BUT -- it does bother me when the "Christian roots" of both European and
American societies are being celebrated as if they were our only roots -- Last
I looked, those weren't "Christian Numerals" we were counting on  -- and Plato
wasn't a Christian was he?  and if we know what Aristotle is, we may owe that
fact to the Arabic preservation of certain works --

Yes, this also bothers me considerably.  But that depends on the
hallucination of the Ancient Orient, now decayed into chaos, which requires
the modern civilising values of the West to bring it to its true self -with
first the British and now the US as disinterested midwives.

I watched an interesting documentary the other night on the French banning
of the headscarf.  I can't read it as anything as naked racism.  Apart from
the immediate effect (the expulsion and social isolation of hundreds of
Islamic girls, the bleakness of their futures literally without any
education - unlike here, there are only three Islamic schools in France) the
long term effects are horrendously divisive.  As one Islamic spokesman
pointed out, public schools in France are the engines of assimilation there,
and this decision effectively stymies that process, and it's also
galvanising and focusing very many non-practising Muslims who, not
unincidentally, have an average unemployment rate of 40 per cent.  A French
woman intellectual was interviewed saying that the hijab was incompatible
with freedom, that its wearing signified that a woman could be abused and
was inferior, which I thought a surprisingly simplistic, nay, fundamentalist
reading.  I thought of a recent case here, where there was a big stink when
a girl who played in one of the local league soccer teams was sent off the
field by a referee for refusing to take off her headscarf.  Her team, and
the opposition, refused to play, the match was cancelled, and the referee
resigned in the resultant furore.  This girl had been happily playing soccer
for years without any trouble, which doesn't quite fit the accepted model of
repression.  Islam is a complex phenomenon, and it's by no means all
Taliban, just as Christianity is not all Fundamentalist Baptists.  The
question is all about how we process and accept difference.

The scarf thing came up during one of the times I was resident in France.
It started with four girls and one principal. My crowd was pretty mixed and
pretty secular--even the Moslems thought the scarves should be outlawed in
the school. Pragmatic outsider, I was the only one to suggest that the
principal was a putz and should have just looked the other way. I have no
doubt he was racist, and the motivation for backing the ban  is on the part
of many clearly racist. But there are other issues. The way it's usually
expressed by non-racists is that the schools are indeed the engines of
assimilation, but into a rigidly secularist society in which religious
expression is freely permitted but limited to non-governmental sites.
Catholic kids, if they wear a cross, do so out of sight beneath their
clothes, otherwise it's taken away, and Jewish kids aren't alowed to wear a
skullcap. If the child or parents want more open religious expression in
school the kid is sent to a private school. Most private schools in France
are religious and have no greater prestige than the public schools, and
they all adhere by law to the public school curriculum except in matters of
religious instruction. If I remember correctly the teachers in the
religious schools undergo the same certification as public school teachers.
Many of the religious schools are very low-cost, deriving a large part of
their operating expenses from the denomination or from private donations.

French secularism was designed as a protection a=gainst the dominance of
the catholic church. Many of the great churches of France are in
semiruinous condition because, unless they've become state museums (which
means no more worship),they get no state money. The cathedral of Saint
Denis, where the French kings are buried, is divided in two: the front half
is church property and pays its own way, to get into the back half you have
to buy a ticket, as in other state museums, which helps allay the costs of
maintenance.

Whatever the solution to the scarf issue, clearly France could use more
Moslem schools.

Subject:      Abu Ghraib Torture -- beyond the reach of the law??
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

From the Guardian Weekly-May 6-12, 2004, page 6

'Dirty' war for profit evades reach of law

Washington diary Julian Borger

Julian Borger


The pictures of Iraqi prisoners allegedly being tortured by their American
guards last week marked a new low point in the sorry story of the
occupation, particularly when set alongside the rapidly fading talk of
liberation. But just as shocking was the revelation that the interrogation
of detainees in Iraq had quietly been privatised.

The idea that extracting information from prisoners might be turned into a
for-profit operation would have seemed a black joke not long ago - the
premise for a Monty Python sketch, perhaps.

Now it is clearly no more than the next logical step in the creeping
privatisation of conflict. Security firms have an estimated 20,000 employees
in Iraq - a huge private army that guards politicians and pipelines and has
inevitably been drawn into direct combat in recent months.

So, if there were not enough military intelligence and CIA interrogators to
get around to the thousands of Iraqis picked up in the security sweeps of
hostile areas, hiring free-lance "intelligence specialists" must have seemed
a no-brainer for cost-conscious government planners.

The initial US military report into the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib
prison makes for unpleasant reading. It is clear that a breakdown in basic
norms of humanity occurred amid the filth and overcrowding, and under the
neglectful eyes of senior officers such as Brigadier General Janis
Karpinski, a reservist who is clearly out of her depth supervising military
prisons.

Now back home in civilian life, Karpinski still seemed unaware of the
enormity of the crimes committed under her watch in Iraq. When the Guardian
called her, she was outraged that anyone should have disturbed the peace of
a South Carolina Sunday morning on such matters. Her equally irate husband
grabbed the phone and shouted: "Don't ever call. You know the rules!"

There were few rules in Abu Ghraib - which not long ago was held up by
Washington and London as the apotheosis of Saddam Hussein's sadism. US
military intelligence cordoned off a cellblock and co-opted young military
policemen into softening up the targets of their interrogation.

Among the interrogators were employees of a company called CACI
International, one of the military and intelligence contractors that has
prospered over recent years in northern Virginia, in easy driving distance
of the Pentagon and the CIA headquarters in Langley.

The contractors are no more than the expression of market forces. The
shrinking of the cold-war US military in the 1990s has created an urgent
need for hired guns in a post-September 11 world, where the armed forces are
as stretched as they have ever been. Meanwhile the downsizing of the army,
navy and air force has generated a corresponding supply of ex-military
recruits who find that they can make $100,000 a year doing what they used to
do for peanuts.

CACI's website claims that the firm "has rapidly grown into a world leader
in providing timely solutions to the intelligence community".

The military investigation by Major General Antonio Taguba reserves some of
its harshest criticism  for CACI's employees, whom he accused of being among
those giving the orders in Abu Ghraib. The investigation also found that
there was credible evidence that a contract worker employed as a translator
raped a young inmate.

Seventeen soldiers and officers have been relieved of their duties, and six
low-ranking military police guards face the prospect of a court martial. But
there is no set of rules for the contractors. One was detained by military
investigators but released later because the military realised that it had
no jurisdiction over him.

That is a very important part of the problem with private contractors in
combat zones such as Iraq. They are not answerable to any law. They cannot
be court-martialled under the military code of conduct, and Paul Bremer, the
governor of Iraq, specifically excluded them from Iraqi law in a decree
issued last June. The mercenaries fall through the cracks.

When the employees of another private security contractor, DynCorp,  were
found to have been running a human trafficking and prostitution racket in
Bosnia, they quietly slipped out of the country. They were fired, but so
were the whistleblowers who brought their crimes to light.

This legal grey zone may well not be entirely accidental, of course. It
means that private contractors can be used to do dirty work for the military
or the CIA with plausible deniability and relative immunity.

In the eyes of military and intelligence chiefs this very attribute makes
them an attractive weapon in the "global war on terror", a conflict fought
out in the shadows where the normal legal niceties are a hindrance. It is
analogous to Guantanamo Bay, another legal loophole that allows Washington
to evade the conventional rules of war.

The plethora of military contractors also saves the government money, at
least in theory. The hired guns can be sent into action in a crisis and
dispensed with afterwards.

The very real problems with the  privatisation of war can be summed up in a
few words: Falluja and Abu Ghraib. At the end of March four employees of the
security firm Blackwater drove into an ambush in Falluja, Iraq's most
dangerous town. Their killing, mutilation and the public display of their
remains provoked outrage and triggered a bloody battle that lasted a month.
The Blackwater workers had none of the protection or access to intelligence
of uniformed soldiers, and yet the US felt equally obliged to avenge their
deaths. It was the worst of both worlds. Meanwhile a powerful multi-billion
dollar industry has grown up around the US capital with a vested interest in
stretching out the conflict.

Abu Ghraib is another urgent warning of the costs of turning war into a
business. It is too early to say to what extent the role of hired
interrogators contributed to the descent into depravity over the past few
months of 2003, but it is clear that their murky status will make it harder
to administer justice.

I find it odd (sad) how closely such debates hold to
various nationalisms, patriotisms, continentisms,
civilizationisms, & ceteraisms.

Did the internationalism  (bourgeois, privileged, and
orientalist, yes I know) of modernism really leave the
post-it with no alternate legacy than this kind of USA
vs. Europe and Demo Republic vs. Constitutional
Monarch crap?

Some anarcho-libertarian MIT prof - name escapes me  -
when asked about whether “nationalism” could ever be
conceived as good/beneficial/justifiable, suggested
that if by “nationalism” it is meant the
governments,‘power-elites,’ and paranoid bodies known
as states, then NO, nationalism will never be a decent
platform for the organization of social realities. As
for a decent organization of poetic possibilities. . .


The fact that members, even of this list, **appear**
to buy into the laughably false concord (as in
pleasing sound)of “We the People” and its shadow
cabinet, American (and GLOBAL) social reality, is, I
think, fucked up.

That said, I'm certain that everyone on this list
would like to see a more just, equitable world. And I
don't think I or most others have any moral upperhand
in these sweepstakes.

But what of poetics? Local, national, international,
continental, translated, hyphenated - millions of
unique voices but LIKE IT OR NOT (?), it's a pack of
rich old white fuckers that seem to hold court.

**As a side note, I’ve been thinking that capitalism,
particularly American capitalism, has been GREAT for
poetry. There’s just so much good poetry everywhere,
once you make a few connections. BOOM! BOOM! ZOWIE!
CHA-CHING!! POW!! A kazillion blooming flowers. As
every Tom, Dickette, and Silliman knows, there’s  more
exceptional post-avant poetry than can be meaningfully
read or written. I’m not so up on my Afghani, Croat,
or Indian poetry of course, but hey I’ve got so much
American English moving inside me I’ll be able to
retire from the scene at 55. Maybe take up golf or
numerology.

Raymond:

What I call sloppy think is precisely the mixture of truths, half-truths
and inaccuracies that gets reflected in your message. Nobody on this list
would disagree about the North's exploitation of the South - you are
preaching to the converted and you know it. And, yes, having taken part in
several demonstrations against Berlusconi and fascism (both in Belgium and
Italy) in the last few years, I do not consider myself as an anti-american
fanatic or a self-righteous European.

But why pretend that social security (or, for that matter, state-funded
pensions systems) is not matter of political choices and, ultimately, of
the kind of society one wishes to live in? You yourself suggest that the
money that goes into the military does not go into welfare. European
taxpeyrs pay social security taxes which are up to three or four times
higher than in the US (with up to 27 percent of the salaries of Dutch
workers going for such programs). From the perspective of European and US
workers, the question sometimes becomes what you do with your money and not
just where it comes from. And the fact that we are aware of the North's
exploitation of the South does not dispense from the need to defend the
rights of workers in our own countries.

I did not ignore your main point but objected to the examples you use to
illustrate your point. Where does Prodi state that Europe holds "the
monopoly on the traditions of Christianity, Judaism, Greece, Rome, the
Enlightenment"? Prodi is a man who is barely on speaking terms with
Berlusconi and who has distinguished himself as one of the country's most
successful post-war prime ministers (I am also adopting an historical
perspective here, as you can see).  We don't need more enemies ...=20

Michel:

1) The European Welfare state was created because after World War II
American taxpayers paid for huge standing armies that allowed European
states to shift resources from the military to welfare while being defended
from the Russians. This continues the US spends many times more on European
defence than European states do and this should end why couldn't Europe stop
the genocide in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Croatia?

The European social system exists because for 500 years Europeans plundered
the world and became rich.

Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Slavery, European Colonialism in Africa these were not
America's doing it was estimated by Edoardo Galeano that 45% of all the
wealth in Europe rightfully belongs to Latin Americans.

 The wealth that made Cambridge, Oxford, The Sorbonne, Bologna, Salamanca,
and most European Educational and other institutions, museums, companies
began its life in the Americas and Africa, this is not Sloppy thinking, go
to Potosi or Mexico or the Congo and tell me it is not so.

 We Americans have been plundering for a mere 200 years do not try to tell
us that you have no role in these injustices because you do the entire
developed world is using someone else's money.

2) The fact is that you ignored my main point. Why is it that Muslim
populations in Europe are still, 40 years later not integrated and one of
the US's leading generals in Iraq is an Arab American? Why is it that an
Arab American can run for president (Ralph Nader)and no one attacks him for
being foreign? Why is it that a headscarf is a major issue in France?
The reason is because what defines a European in most of Europe is what you
were born this is more important than what you assent to.

3) Europe does not hold the monopoly on the traditions of Christianity,
Judaism, Greece, Rome, the Enlightenment there are millions of American who
are opposed to Bush and what he is doing and we will have our chance in
November to remove him from office because we have a liberal democratic
republic here which is no more flawed than a republic that has Fascists in
the Government (Italy), or a Fascist who won 15% of the presidental vote
(France, LePen)or many other anomolies.

4) Americans believe in open healthy debate but we do not define who we are
by our Religion, inspite of what Mr Bush says, we are defined by the fact
that the only royal 'we'used here is coupled with the People.

I cringe at being lectured as well we are all culpable we all need to change
the way we personally live if we want to change the world.

Sorry but this kind of sloppy thinking makes me cringe =85 May I remind you
that the Welfare State is also financed by taxes and different kinds of
compulsory social security systems? At a time when privatization of former
common goods is becoming a strong global trend, I wonder who would trade
the European social security system for America's lack thereof

Also, wouldn't it be fair to reproduce Romano Prodi's full statement before
accusing him of despising Europe's muslim populations? Here it is:

"A new Europe built on the fundamental values that have fashioned it in the
course of its history, which also have their roots in the Christian
tradition, offers benefits for everyone, whatever their philosophical or
spiritual tradition.

As we lay the foundations of a new, enlarged European Union it would not be
right to marginalise the religions and movements that have contributed, and
are still contributing, so much to the culture and humanism that Europe is
rightly so proud of.

That does not mean failing to recognise or denigrating the need for a
secular state and a secular Europe. It simply means taking account of
Europe's roots, which lie in religious and spiritual movements as well as
in humanism, the enlightenment and the Greek and Roman heritage.

Recognising these roots does not signal rejection or exclusion of others.
Europe's true strength has always lain in mingling and coalescing different
influences and cultures.

How can we put Christianity, Judaism and Islam in separate boxes in a
Europe that proclaims its pluralism and tolerance?

The separation of the public and religious spheres does not mean denying or
ignoring religions and their many believers.

I believe that an open, healthy debate between the Community institutions
and religious confessions is now both possible and necessary. In fact the
Commission's White Paper on European governance mentions the need for the
participation of religious groups and consultations with them."

    Hello all,

    Spring has finally arrived in Ottawa, and so has the Spring 2004 issue of
    National Capital Letters: Ottawa's Literary Environment
    (http://capletters.ncf.ca).

    This issue confirms that literary arts and heritage are alive and well in
    the capital, with articles on Archibald Lampman's lasting importance for
    Ottawa poets, and records of contemporary literary activities, from the Slam
    scene to the celebration of National Poetry Month.  We also have tributes to
    the Tree Reading Series, the winning essays in the Duncan Campbell Scott
    Non-Fiction Prose Contest, a report on the Ottawa Literary Awards, and much
    more!

    National Capital Letters provides a venue for the recognition of Ottawa's
    rich literary history and for the promotion of the current, vibrant scene.
    The editors welcome submissions of articles, interviews, book reviews,
    literary manifestos, and any discourse on writers or literary events related
    to Ottawa, past and present.

    You can contact National Capital Letters at capletters@ncf.ca or visit us at

Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm trying to develop a mailing list of libraries that have strong
collections in French literature, and/or French visual arts. This is for
the purpose of announcing a book by Chax Press by French writer and artist
Pierre Bettencourt. It's a handmade book, letterpress, with color prints,
hand bound with handmade paper wrappers -- so I imagine most library buyers
will be Special Collections and Rare Book libraries. The surrealist fables
in the book are printed in French and English. If you know any such
libraries that might like to know about such a book, please backchannel me
with the address and contact information.

Also, if anyone on this list might be interested in knowing more about such
a book, let me know, and I can either send you the PDF of the announcement,
or send you a copy of it.

Thank you,

Charles Alexander

As I read it, it means to say that we trust in something larger than

*(one Abrahamic version)*


The Speech Dubya Dreamed

Cut your losses you son of a bitch.

This is the sweetest love song
you ever did hear
(of Betty Crocker kids in hell).

In fact it's your land, disintegrating.
Soon the Hubble will not see you
the same and instead of the stars
you'll see the light of democracy
shine.



Stirring
Stirring
the cookie dough
one day I found an accidental ice pick
with which I chipped my heartache
20 ways 'til Tuesday, and
then I ate the melting chocolate
rich and semi-sweet.
It was that moment that the epiphany came
like sweet Jesus coming in from the rain-

none of you pigs would be here
if it weren't for the coupling of Noah.

"In God We Trust" always had a strange resonance. It made me assume that in
those early constitutional days - especially around issues of money - human
trust for one one another, as well as trust in a community or national
sense, was an unlikely combination and it was best to hand it (trust) over
to the possibly better will & trust of this outsider (God).
Somehow I don't think God is investing much trust back in our sovereign
leader, nor do we the people seem to be either. And I imagine, looking at
his poll numbers, George B. must be on the verge of withdrawing his trust in
the Almighty's trust, as well. One worries, six gun & Cheney in either hand,
what Bush will turn to. One trembles to think, and certainly not trust that
outcome.
So trust it seems is up for grabs. Be curious to see if Sen. Kerry can wake
up and grab and share a little with this occasional  trusty Republic.

God is never singular. History, and current events, prove this. As for
Buddhist, I'm didn't say this, but "Buddha Nature," which like God, is
beyond the logos, and beyond numeration.
 As for money. I once worked three days for Sutro & Co., in San Francisco,
and quit during lunch hour, sending them a telegram that I wouldn't be back,
that adding columns of monetary figures all day had made me nauseous beyond
belief.

In the case of George's dime the singular god would appear to be Roosevelt,
which he was in my family, altho in those days his head was still attached
to his body. Maybe it's something like pharaohs or caesars, except that
presidents usually aren't acknowledged as gods until after their deaths,
and never, as with the caesars, as salads.

I'm sure if you tried to argue that it meant "Allah" there would be
objections... It's a reflection of the Protestant equation of thrift and
profit with godliness.  Though I've always sort of assumed, from my long
range watching of US tv and foreign policy, that it means that Money is God.

BABYLON MINISTRY OF MISINFORMATION

It has been brought to the attention of the proto-civilians of the
region of the Tigris-Euphrates that at the event of the 21st Century AD
much of our culture's 5000 plus years of future invention & evolution
of civilization will be lost, forgotten, erased, appropriated, burned,
americanized, exploited, & trampled on. In 3000 BCE The BABYLON
MINISTRY OF MISINFORMATION had the vision to initiate a node to witness
& remember the fragments of glyphs, signs, letterforms, ledgers,
tablets, proclamations, lyrics & texts which repeated
Expansionist-Nations will seek to overthrow. We are seeking the
inventive actions of all artists & poets of the future to help remember
WhatCouldBe .

I trust this is a poem with an unreliable narrator, but I am concerned it
isn't.  If this is actual, I will have something to say, starting with
"You have plenty of company."  It is amazing to me how fragile a book
contract can be.  And I should add -- for any poetry publishers on this
list -- I am not referring to a poetry experience, but to a non-poetry
house.

Hi Martha



My guess is that Steve is making a factual statement.



Steve, if this is a factual statement, who's the musician? Is it by any
chance Thomas Chapin or Cooper-Moore?



Around 1990, Clark Coolidge wrote The Rova Improvisations, poems based on
listening to an 8-CD set of the Rova Saxophone Quartet's recordings?

I'd consider trying it myself, except that once I start writing I pretty
much shut out everything around me.

George,
I attend baseball games; I eat hotdogs; I pay with U.S. cash for both, =
the tickets and the food.  I read only one thing printed on the cash, =
the denomination. I trust no one when it comes to getting the correct =
change back at the ballpark.=20

And, while I don't care that the message "IN GOD WE TRUST" appears on =
the coin of the realm, I'm curious to know why the trust message appears =
only on the back of the bill or coin. =20

But in truth folks, remember this, the Secretary of the Treasury makes =
the design decisions and she or he does so without either approval of =
nor input from either Congressional House. =20

The message appears on the money because the first Secretary of the =
Treasury approved a design that had put it there.  Hell, as far as I =
know, the initial designer may have been a sarcastic atheist sticking =
his/her finger in the eye of the citizenry, or better yet, the designer =
may have been a Satan worshiper and may have been making reverent =
reference to his personal deity. =20

To the best of my knowledge, there is no law enacted by the Congress =
dictating that the message be printed on the money.   However, I doubt =
seriously any congressperson has the spirit it would require to sponsor =
a bill in either house demanding that the message be deleted. =20

Even dogs have their reasons for doing things...we just don't speak =
spaniel, so we don't understand those reasons. =20

Hey Gerald

If Andy Drury is a drummer, tell him I said hello. I knew him years ago when
he was a student at Wesleyan & I was writing for Coda. He might still
remember me. Taylor Ho Bynum heard me read my poetry 4 or 5 years ago with
Rich McGhee's Trytone---I actually wanted Rich to try to bring him into the
band--but we only met once, so he might not remember my name at all. Thsi
sounds like a great show.

Good luck!

Vernon

Running Through Fire: How I Survived the Holocaust
by Zosia Goldberg as Told to Hilton Obenzinger  (Mercury House, Publiahwe

Congratulations Hilton to you and your wonderful cast at Stanford last
night. Nary a dry eye in the quite full house. Among much of Zosia's
sardonic, witful and precarious tale of survival as an assimilated Pole, the
torture scenes were harrowing -  particularly in the light of recent
revelations about the ways in which our so-called "Command Structure" has
implemented similarly grotesque methods with Iraqi and Afghan prisoners of
war. "Never again", Oy!

Suspect if you recover from your birthday celebration last night - as well -
you will announce the upcoming performances in Berkeley and New York.

Leaving Tuesday, coming back around 6/25. I'm reading your "Post-Beat-Poets
(Credo # 2) as part of my presentation at the Beat Meets West conference.
We're in a packing frenzy, running down to the wire. I'll talk about it
more, but I don't know if this is going to the List or to you directly.
Backchannel me (i.e. write to me directly instead of to the List) later &
I'll fill you in.

The Ex Models – Other Mathematics
Do Make Say Think – Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret
Hymn
Matmos – The Civil war
Young People – War Prayers
Shellac – 1000 Hurts
Lightning Bolt – Beautiful Rainbow
Pretty Girls Make Graves – Good Health
Explosions in the Sky – How Strange, Innocence
Les Savy Fav – Inches
Marc Ribot/John Zorn – Masada Guitars
Modest Mouse – The Lonesome Crowded West

"I got wood legs and bow legs and no legs at all
Goddamn! Would you accept a collect call?
Oh no, I don't understand
I got sore eyes and poor eyes and no eyes at all
Goddamn! Would you like to take a fall?
No I don't like this plan
It was a staple of brass tacks and waxed backs
A memo left on the forehead of God
Sent sealed and signed by the saints who sang this
song:
"We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation
Then one day, you'll find us sitting
in your chairs with big ideas of stocks and shares."

from "Beach Side Property" by Modest Mouse

U.S. Soldier Found Guilty of Deserting Murder Squad in Iraq:
Cheney Calls His Moral Principles 'Unamerican'
by Russty Byfokal



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

All genres?  Poemcrazy and Bird by Bird. Writing Down the Bones and Wild
Mind. Robin Behn's and Chase Twichell's "The Practice of Poetry." I also
still like every now and then to read The Triggering Town by Richard Hugo.
Interesting book from a Young Adult writer ME Kerr, Blood on the Forehead
has some good stuff. I'm not sure these are hip enough but they work for my
students -- and me. Hope this helps.

Time and again the passage across the impasse, impassive,
dispassionate alignments delineate the detour around the lines of
block-housing, entire towns housed here. Once in a while the miles
contract to form trajectories, comprehensible sequences. The mute
functionalism of units stacked one above another, city blocks locked
in a spatial array of mutual removal. One at a time for the time being
motions are committed from memory, the volume on the television
increases upstairs, while downstairs inaudible toasts greet laughter.
Somewhere a radio. Across the street, a man beats rugs for a living,
and the thuds echo heavily throughout the housing blocks on warm days.

What's there to see? There was the space that could be stepped into
and which allowed for moving through it, the space itself, did you
move through that space, there were projections. Put something down
for the moment, right now, anything, like that book on its face,
or the lit switch. Neither one can be seen, brushed across the surface
of something or other. That's not what it was thought to be
and couldn't, it just couldn't be, no more than whatever it was
it might have been. There isn't anything to put there, place here,
other than the perception that the place itself is disappearing
under the pressure of other sides to the same thing, something.

Sometimes there is this search for an affirmation of anything,
though what, if that's impossible to say, and it is. Children
are laughing in the corridor again. Unbearable to be. That book
on its face tells a story in a language that refuses to move
one word from another beyond one another.

You read it until the end and then it's over.
There's got to be something else, something more, than so many names
and locations, placements, fictive equivalents of a mutual will
to ascribe to the described scene the definiteness of place.

>wow do you ever listen to music?

Um. Care to clarify? (I.e., are you familiar with the
artists listed?)

I'd have thought that a self-described "non-academic
poet" responisble for  "a batch" of poems for Cecil
Taylor would have more open ears.


Is Ornette Coleman music?

Is Steve Reich’s “It’s Gonna Rain (I & II)” music?

(For that matter, were the Four Horsemen poets?)

Anyway, I think you'd really like Matmos' second-last
album "A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure." The
entire record is built up from samples of plastic
surgery and medical technology which the bands' two
members (one is an English prof. at Berkeley actually)
recorded 'in the field.'

I think you might also enjoy Japan's Boredoms. Here’s
excerpts from an interview with the band:

In the recent Boredoms CD, Pop Tatari, there is a
picture in the booklet of you. It looks like you are
with Lee 'Scratch' Perry...Is that right? Where did
you meet him?

Yoshimi: Yeah! (laughs) I love him. I went to see him
play live in Osaka and then went after him (laughing)
...

Eye, Is that your real name?

Eye: Actually, it comes from my younger sister's name
Aiko. I took the Ai part, writing it out like the
English word 'eye.' No meaning, I just did it.

Did that happen around the time you dropped the 'i'
from the band name Hanatarashi when it became
Hanatarash.

Eye: Mmmaybe, but nothing intentional (laughs).

Hanatarash were a pretty infamous band that was known
for wild, violent live performances. There is a rumor
that you drove a bulldozer through the wall of the
club where you were performing. Is that true?

Eye: Yes. It was the dinosaur kind. With the back hoe
scooper. Just drove it into the club.

Was the club owner happy with you destroying the walls
of his club?

Eye: Hmm. We pretty much destroyed... ruined that
club. I was planning on throwing Molotov cocktails but
the bulldozer I was driving tipped over and gasoline
spilled out. If we threw the Molotov cocktails, we
would have set the whole place on fire.

Is that the same show where you had a circular saw
strapped on your back and accidentally cut your leg?

Eye: That was a different show.

Have you felt the sound has changed since you started?
Will the new album be different than Pop Tatari?

Eye: The first album was not really musical because
Yoshikawa didn't really know how to play drums.

Yoshimi: It was great, but it wasn't music.

Eye: He would always kinda play around the edges, hit
all kinds of strange parts on the drum. His sweat
would be flying all over the place because he was a
very energetic drummer.

People in the U.S. have the stereotype that women in
Japan are very subservient to men. Yoshimi, what kind
of reaction do you get being a woman drummer? Is this
stereotype even true?

Yoshimi: When playing with Boredoms I don't think
about me being a woman and them being men or anything
like that. Just being in a band.

I guess I meant more like reactions from other people
in Japan towards you.

Yoshimi: Some people may think I am kind of scary,
both men and women. They think it is hard to come up
and talk to me.

Eye, you did some duets with John Zorn during the
Noisefest Tokyo show at the Knitting Factory in New
York. Is that ever going to be released?

Eye: I don't know if they were recorded or not.

I understand you went to visit Caroliner Rainbow
today. How did you find out about them and what is it
about them that you like?

Eye: I learned about them from Steve Albini and got
one of their records from David of Public Bath. I
really like their music. I was very shocked and
impressed by what I saw at their house today.

Skeletons, mummified animals, bright fluorescent
colors...

Eye: Mmmmm yeah.

A friend wanted me to ask "Why are wild and crazy
bands like Boredoms only coming from Japan and not the
United States? Is it something about the Japanese
culture?"

(loud laughter)

Eye: I say San Francisco,... San Francisco is more
...more, More crazy!

Stephen,

Can you tell me a little about the 'terms' or formal
parameters which guide your collaboration with Chris
Sullivan? As “visual responses” I take it you had no
direct involvement in the selection of the images. Do
they change how you read your own work?

How is it to write knowing your work will be set to
images, or, rather, that images will be set to your
work.  It’s a *relatively* common form of
collaboration,  I know, but I think I’d find it
daunting.

It=B9s interesting how =AD particularly in the last 35 years of NEA and State
sponsored support =AD poetry and other creative practices have been nourished
in K =AD 12 schools in the USA. The support has been multi-angled =AD from the
joy and practical application of students becoming immersed in the creative
process, increased reading and critical skills, collaborative and
competitive respect etc., certainly all goals contributing to the communal
good. (Perhaps obviously, I used to write grant program applications for
Poetry-in-the-Schools). Yet, particularly as =B3homeland security=B2 becomes th=
e
wedge, the common good is put through the warp of another definition in
which speech, creative expression and critical skill runs the risk of
outrageous repression. Vigilance, Exposure and Resistance to these
=B3security=B2 acts are becoming increasingly urgent =AD whether or not the
repressive actions are directly or indirectly enacted by authorities =AD such
as in the story below. I can only begin to imagine the bravery of poetry an=
d
art teachers (let alone other teachers) under similar threat of these
circumstances.=20


Hard lessons from poetry class:  Speech is free unless it's critical
By BILL HILL
Last update: 15 May 2004
=20
Bill Nevins, a New Mexico high school teacher and personal friend, was fire=
d
last year and classes in poetry and the poetry club at Rio Rancho High
School were permanently terminated. It had nothing to do with obscenity, bu=
t
it had everything to do with extremist politics.
The "Slam Team" was a group of teenage poets who asked Nevins to serve as
faculty adviser to their club. The teens, mostly shy youngsters, were taugh=
t
to read their poetry aloud and before audiences. Rio Rancho High School gav=
e
the Slam Team access to the school's closed-circuit television once a week
and the poets thrived.

In March 2003, a teenage girl named Courtney presented one of her poems
before an audience at Barnes & Noble bookstore in Albuquerque, then read th=
e
poem live on the school's closed-circuit television channel.

A school military liaison and the high school principal accused the girl of
being "un-American" because she criticized the war in Iraq and the Bush
administration's failure to give substance to its "No child left behind"
education policy.

The girl's mother, also a teacher, was ordered by the principal to destroy
the child's poetry. The mother refused and may lose her job.

Bill Nevins was suspended for not censoring the poetry of his students.
Remember, there is no obscenity to be found in any of the poetry. He was
later fired by the principal.

After firing Nevins and terminating the teaching and reading of poetry in
the school, the principal and the military liaison read a poem of their own
as they raised the flag outside the school. When the principal had the flag
at full staff, he applauded the action he'd taken in concert with the
military liaison.=20

Then to all students and faculty who did not share his political opinions,
the principal shouted:! "Shut y our faces." What a wonderful lesson he gave
those 3,000 students at the largest public high school in New Mexico. In hi=
s
mind, only certain opinions are to be allowed.

But more was to come. Posters done by art students were ordered torn down,
even though none was termed obscene. Some were satirical, implicating a
national policy that had led us into war. Art teachers who refused to rip
down the posters on display in their classrooms were not given contracts to
return to the school in this current school year.

The message is plain. Critical thinking, questioning of public policies and
freedom of speech are not to be allowed to anyone who does not share the
thinking of the school principal.

The teachers union has been joined in a legal action against the school by
the National Writers Union, headquartered in New York City. NWU's at-large
representative Samantha Clark lives and works in Albuquerque. The American
Civil Liberties Union has become the legal arm of the lawsuit pending in
federal court.=20

Meanwhile, Nevins applied for a teaching post in another school and was
offered the job but he can't go to work until Rio Rancho's principal sends
the new school Nevins' credentials. The principal has refused to do so, and
that adds yet another issue to the lawsuit, which is awaiting a trial date.
While students are denied poetry readings, poetry clubs and classes in
poetry, Nevins works elsewhere and writes his own poetry.

Writers and editors who have spent years translating essays, films, poems,
scientific articles and books by Iranian, North Korean and Sudanese authors
have been warned not to do so by the U.S. Treasury Department under penalty
of fine and imprisonment. Publishers and film producers are not allowed to
edit works authored by writers in those nations. The Bush administration
contends doing so has the effect of trading with the enemy, despite a 1988
law that exempts published materials from sanction under trade rules.

Robert Bovenschulte, president o! f the Am erican Chemical Society, is
challenging the rule interpretation by violating it to edit into English
several scientific papers from Iran.

Are book burnings next?

I was alarmed by the dual use of the word "critical" in the forwarded
article.  "Critical thinking" and "being critical of the government" are
not identical pursuits.

I guess partially because I'm coming from a different place, too, with
my opinions on this matter.  While I recognize the problem of arts in
the schools and free speech, I do wonder how, for very young children,
arts in the schools programs are encouraging certain types of critical
thinking and artistic responses.

I guess I would hope that we teachers and artists are not simply, like
marketers, simply seeking and finding less and less critical "market
share" by teaching children.

The political tensions in the schools, where most children still hold
the political beliefs of their parents, and in small towns in the west
and southwest, where those political beliefs are more likely than not to
be politically conservative and/or supported by military installations,

creating a town and gown problem, or tensions between more liberal
faculty students attempt to please and more conservative parents
students also attempt to please, can hardly benefit high school and
younger students as much as "critical thinking" or "creative writing
technique" in general could.

Based on my own experience, too -- I assumed a reading series at a chain
bookstore because the previous slam-based open mike, when the curator
went off his medication, became a weekly rowdy anti-war rant.  Not all
bad, but not a poetry reading. -- I wonder at slam politics
(sloganeering, hardly nuanced poly sci) being supported in the schools
under the aegis of giving students self-confidence.  What happened to
teaching art?

All best,
Catherine Daly

recombinant production tending towards white-hole implosion

this is so simple, if it weren't for the theme of spew/emissions/symbol,
it would be close to ludicrous.

in fact it is old-fashion, _an image_ and nothing more, in relation to

I am a poet in residence in the school in the Lawndale/Little Village
neighborhood of Chicago about 80% of my kids are Mexican American the
balance African American. It has been my experience that the kids are served
best when I

1) give them the best poetry possible to read, this means, Neruda, Williams,
Pound, Lorca, Whitman, HD, Mistral, Paz. and that the poetry is not watered
down if they get 30% of it at least they get 30% of greatness and not 100%
of crap.

2) I demand excellence from them these kids;they are not lauded and they
need to be,  but by actually creating excellence spelling correctly, using
language well.

3) Making sure that the children are required to actually interact with
language and grow.

It is my experience that politics will come out of this mix as will critical
thinking. I also think that conservative and "Conservative" are different
things. Most of the kids in my school come from conservative backgrounds
their parents work hard, they are mostly Catholics they are personally
conservative but they are not "Conservative" the way Fox News is
Conservative.

I also believe that the reason that the Right can demonize the Left in the
classroom especially with little kids is because we do not believe in rigor.
There are many other poets in residence in Chicago who do not demand rigor
from their kids they want to help them "feel" or they have a political
agenda I think this is destructive for little kids lets give these kids the
best and they can sort out their opinions. Excellence is the answer not
politics, if you give kids great work to read there minds will expand, I am
sure all of us on the list had a teacher who did this for them.

Catherine, for some reason, I find myself more than a little alarmed by your
response here:
1. I assume that the process of making any poem - at least on that rises
above a prescribed rhetoric or expectation - engages critical strategies, as
simple at why to use one word rather than another. This attention to words
may naturally lead to critically examining words in text books, political
speech, etc., etc., as measured against one's perceptions or collisions with
the actual world. (Certainly anybody's reading of a range of writers - from
Pound to Zukofksy and the objectivists or Muriel Rukeyser, or Audre Lorde,
to name but a few, would certainly spur one to look and reexamine the
immediate world).  The fact that this critical collision - the critical
reading of poetry and - from there - critically examining the Government may
occur and provoke creative work and action that is in turn provocative seems
to me to be an implicit part of the history of the medium. Co-incidentally,
it's no accident that in Britain, the "new critics" of poetry  became
employed by British Intelligence for their brilliance in critically
examining and interpreting the coded documents of Germans and spies. The
fact that some became double agents for the Russians is another matter!

 Excuse me if, in my haste, I misunderstand your point here. I suspect -
certainly it occurs in my own work - that the political realities of this
particular time are going to encourage collisions between poetry and those
folks and authorities who wish to enforce other views. I think to
collaborate with a principal -such as the one portrayed in New Mexico - is
at great risk and damage to both community and students. (Any of us who grew
up during the McCarthyist years of the fifties will know this experience to
the core).

I am not sure - if I read you correctly - what you want to say about the
connection and your aversion to Poetry Slams (and I assume by connection,
"Hip hop") and how the phenomenon may or may not impact the teaching of
poetry in the schools. (I am sure your "art" versus "slam poetry" frame will
be offensive to serious practitioners of the latter).  From my own, and I am
sure others on this list who have taught in jails and City schools, hip-hop
is often a launching place to both look at the work itself, as well as
introduce other such highly formalized work into the classroom (say Theodore
Roethke's work was loved in my experience.)
In any case the language of hip-hop seems to me to be an inevitable part of
anyone working in any school, prep, ghetto or otherwise - no matter the
political or any other philosophical, religious, etc. point of view of the
student poet/writer. The creative challenge - it strikes me - is to come up
with a teaching process that engages and/or expands the many different
boundaries, vernacular and "high culture", racial, conservative, radical.
etc. and includes a process to question fixed or rhetorical views in the
poems through a critical look at the strengths or weak points in the use of
the language. There will always be hard hats among some, but I have always
found that in the nature of any class, but not a reason to give up on
students who value risk and change.

Under your comment I sense your concern that some poets - in whatever level
of school - are willfully using the occasion as a political platform to
introduce the writing of poetry with a political cut to it - and not paying
attention to all the other good basics - as well as the poet/teacher being
entirely insensitive to the political bias' of the administrations and the
communities (often conservative school boards) on whose financial and other
support the schools depend.  Common survival sense seems a good tool up to a
point - yet when the Administration is a conscious or unconscious instrument
of  repression, such as the case in New Mexico - I would be alarmed by poets
and teachers who do not figure out ways to challenge and resist.

In all of this I think it's important to realize that these are very
different and highly dangerous times -  and work from there.

WORKSHOPS

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY with Jorge Guitart
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

Andrew,

the Hafler Trio (andrew mckenzie) has just re-released a bunch of older recordings (like kill the king and how to refoem mankind) plus there's a bunch of 7"'s that andrew's been putting out 'cause he had to go to the hospital and is trying to raise money for surgery. newish stuff... the warp label in the UK is reissuing a ton of older material but the newer shit like squarepusher's "do you know squarepusher" and two lone swordsman's "faux" are phenomenal, one more minimal than the other but equally as enticing, sonically profound. lfo's "sheath" is too much for words, it's electro gone back to school, with a shirt and tie undone. check out the video for freak: go to warprecords.com, search for lfo's sheath and check out the video from the link: it's almost debilitating.

That's all I got for you if yr gonna stick to In D rock.

Hey, thanks for the Warp Records tip - I don't know
about debilitating (maybe my speakers aren't as good
as yours), but definately fun ( also - I hadn't
intended to limit choices to "in D" rock or any other
genre - just newish stuff as opposed to say classic
hard bop, the gory days of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir
and so on).

Thanks though, and Michael, if you're keen on
lightning bolt, someone put up a great movie/video
they made for a track [(23 March posting):
http://www.livejournal.com/community/ride_the_skies/].
Aren't they amazing -  the most liberating noise four
arms and  four legs are capable of - and a bass strung
with  two bass strings and a banjo string to boot.
They make McCaffreyite and Bokian sound poets sound
like choir boys. Hail minimalism! Die puny minimalism!

>Emily Pastel'ssample poem:
>
>I know that art comes first because you are a walking, talking exhibitation
>of artness.Yes, the way you dress is so aesthetic let's call it
>"postfashion"
>because you are not a trend, nor an interpretation of somebody else's
>theory...
>I know that art comes first because you draw the heart first, and the "A"
>second, and the second in between represents the time it takes to act on
>instinct
>(or something better)--I want to be an educated Id, interactions based on
>choice, not circumstance (and I choose you, artthinker, to be to)
>...and yeah, so I know fo' sho' that there is no such thing as 'boring
>art.'
>Because that's just decoration, like a bracelet--it's the X bloody and
>stinking like an infection of the palm of the cunt of the heart/ stop the
>clotting
>and let the blood flow...slowly at first, into my fist so in five years if
>I'm
>not by you you'll still flow through my fingers my feet my eyes/ so when I
>look, the world will be red--like it's Judgement Day, and all my sins will
>wash
>away 'till I'm left as naked and sacred as your voice when you say that sex

>the only holy thing...
>...I mean, I know that though you are no cut you are so cool, I'd

>my best friend about you if I had one and I'll try to have fun when
>you're not here (so there's no fear) and I'll try/I'll try/ I'll try to be
>better--'cuz why not, if I can't nothing's lost and I'll try not to
>misplace my thoughts because about you they are so good, I just
>can't get the words straight. Like, "all I create is dying"--like my
>broken bike/ like my broken verse--no meter measures up to
>conversation when you are concerned. That's too one-sided,
>and art is best when it's a dialogue/ I  know that art comes first, and
>I just want to lay it before you, like an offering for an emperor but

>Ian VanHeusen's sample poem:
>
>Buried in a beginning, the poem starts
>with every line
>
>there are one thousand names for midnight
>or rather there are as many movements
>
>as if this word was in all of those directions
>
>he is crazy moon
>breathing the deep sigh for each
>turning as it dances the night
>with a different dream
>he is drunk with an ecstasy that will never be his
>    and chants three words of longing
>     that come down like rain & though the waters rise and fall about him
>                his closed eyes remain fixed on those rythmns
>     pulsating
>
>how they spin around our lives in gestures of the absurd
>reality of distance instead of a song of bright morning
>they say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
>
>he is cloaked in passion that awakes
>his voice in the echo of the midnight fog.
>
>& then there is this one
>this one is aloud without saying a word
>in the city, the stars drown & in this one my soul
>wandered in a thousand midnight movement
>
>It found no rest in the high one,
>who stirred beneath a crazy moon,
>& the waters of life breathe up and down
>in it                       to this night a lover
>chants that cutting symbol
>which opens the shadow of an oak tree
>
>what is that? She points at the breaks in its trunk. Thats a vagina
>   and that is her arched back
>& like water
>now we turn another night
>& now the moon burns full
>
>and this is the night with a window made of rain
>it is a river with our tears
>they come down with a rhythm of patterns burned
>into the very fabric of the humid air of this hour
>
>this 1000 flower bloomed in my ear
>because when our days are filled with a waking nightmare
>our nights become like a mist to rest our eyes
>lady lend me your dance
>& with the crazy movement of our impossible joy
>light these days with fire
>& breath me fire love
>& keep that light from the storms window
>it has been running with our tears

Hello



Elaine and I are leaving tomorrow for China. We expect to return in a month,
although we don't know the exact date yet. Because of our last-minute
packing frenzy, I might not have time to reply if you write. If you have any
literary matters or other messages, you can mail me and I'll take care of
matters when I get home.



Best,



Vernon

Subject:      Queer Constellations; Subcultural Space in the Wake of the City
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Given recent discussions of Benjamin, Stephen
Vincent’s Walking Theories, etc, I thought I’d plug a
new (U of Minnesota Press) book by the prof. who first
introduced me to Benjamin, urbanism, etc (she let me
do my Honors thesis on situationist theory in practice
- walking around downtown edmonton trying to detourn
things . . . )


Queer Constellations

Subcultural Space in the Wake of the City


Dianne Chisholm



Discovers parallels between modern gay and lesbian
views of urban life and Benjamin’s Paris, “the capital
of the nineteenth century.”

Queer Constellations investigates the dreams and
catastrophes of recent urban history viewed through
new queer narratives of inner-city life. The “gay
village,” “gay mecca,” “gai Paris,” the “lesbian
flaneur,” the “lesbian bohème”—these and other urban
phantasmagoria feature paradoxically in this volume as
figures of revolutionary utopia and commodity
spectacle, as fossilized archetypes of social
transformation and ruins of haunting cultural
potential.

Dianne Chisholm introduces readers to new practices of
walking, seeing, citing, and remembering the city in
works by Neil Bartlett, Samuel Delany, Robert Glück,
Alan Hollinghurst, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, Sarah
Schulman, Gail Scott, Edmund White, and David
Wojnarowicz. Reading these authors with reference to
the history, sociology, geography, and philosophy of
space, particularly to the everyday avant-garde
production and practice of urban space, Chisholm
reveals how—and how effectively—queer narrative
documentary resembles and reassembles Walter
Benjamin’s constellations of Paris, “capital of the
nineteenth century.” Considering experimental queer
writing in critical conjunction with Benjamin’s city
writing, the book shows how a queer perspective on
inner-city reality exposes contradictions otherwise
obscured by mythic narratives of progress.

If Benjamin regards the Paris arcade as a microcosm of
high capitalism, wherein the (un)making of industrial
society is perceived retrospectively, in contemporary
queer narrative we see the sexually charged and
commodity-entranced space of the gay bathhouse as a
microcosm of late capitalism and as an exemplary site
for excavating the contradictions of mass sex. In
Chisholm’s book we discover how, looking back on the
ruins of queer mecca, queer authors return to Benjamin
to advance his “dialectics of seeing”; how they cruise
the paradoxes of market capital, blasting a queer era
out of the homogeneous course of history.

Dianne Chisholm is professor of English at the
University of Alberta and the author of H. D.’s
Freudian Poetics: Psychoanalysis in Translation.

In the spirit of "This is not a textbook" books that
are amazing as textbooks:

"Rocks on a Platter" by Barbara Guest
"How to Do Things With Words" by Joan Retallack
"The Non-conformist's Memorial" by Susan Howe
"Grapefruit" by Yoko Ono
"The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers" by Bhanu
Kapil Rider
"The Fifth Book of Peace" by Maxine Hong Kingston
"Fault Lines" by Meena Alexander

Each of these books of poetry and prose willfully
engages the process of making within the work of art
itself to greater or lesser or differing degrees. The
last two are prose. Not in terms of difficulty of text
but in terms of ease in seeing as a teaching tool the
Retallack, Guest, and Kingston books are easiest to
draw lessons and/or discussion topics from; the Howe
book is great and perhaps for students who are doing
interdisciplinary work: history, art, etc. The Ono,
Rider, and Alexander books are all from very very very
different literary aesthetic positions and might
promote dynamic discussion.

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has
taught using any of these books.

Greenery fits like a girl in a
beige dress saving the air
around herself for later when
the hours swell, pulse with

a bloody honey of dusk supper
and mantra of distant bells.
She might have a garden of windchimes
in her throat, and could breathe you

ostinato with tremulous barefoot
formals. The girls here wear
their bellies in their faces, Mom,
and you smell of them long

I also teach disadvantaged people, but not through the schools--  I lead a
workshop at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and also sometimes
teach mentally ll people online.

I agree with Hans on how people are best served.  I bring in good,
supposedly difficult poems for my students to read, and this improves their
writing, in turn.  I git this idea from Kenneth Koch, who taught his college
classes that way (making us imitate and read difficult poets), and who had
also taught kids and nursing home residents in a similar way.  He apparently
started by bringing "easy" poetry when he did poetry outreach to these kinds
of groups, but then found that the students wrote much better if they were
exposed to "real" poetry, even if they didn't understand everything about
it.

Another related lesson from Koch was that poetry isn't written to be
analyzed, it's written to be enjoyed.  And if analyzing it increases your
enjoyment, that's great, but ut's also ok to like a poem without
understanding it.  And if you are a writer, you can take apart poetry by
figuring out what the poet did to make the poem enjoyable (in terms of
craftsmanship) rather than through the eyes of academic criticism.  What's
interesting is that that down-to-earth attitude lead to me increased
interest in analyzing poetry, because once I got the idea of enjoying
poetry, I wanted to learn everything i could about it.  I had not been a
great poetry fan in high school, where poems were presented as if they
always had "hidden themes" and the object was to decipher the metaphors to
get at the themes  Koch use dto say that there are only a very limited
number of themes for poems (such as "I love you", "I am scared of dying",
"our ancestors were brave", "I believe in God", "I believe in rebelling"
etc.) and that the point of the poem is what it does woth language, not the
theme (which is always trite...

People know when they are being talked down to, and appreciate it when
people respect them and teach in a way that challenges them rather than
saying everything they do is wonderful in an uncritical way.

Hi Kyle.

I'll be starting in the Media Studies graduate program at Buffalo in August so I'm not sure if our time will overlap but I lived in the Mitte section of Berlin for a few months in 2001/2002.  I still know people there and some interesting places to
look into - mostly visual arts oriented.  Drop me a line if you want to chat more in depth.

Best,

I backchanneled a somewhat too cursory reply to this & have now lost it;

I have no access to phone or e 12 hrs/day at one of my new jobs

the jist, tho, was that I feel that you haven't understood what I am
trying to say; I am not slamming slam poets, I am slamming the pedagogy
and politics of those poetry teachers who choose not to teach reading
and writing poetry -- I know that many of my students slam really well,
but have no idea how to write a sentence, for example; I am aware this
is a formalist argument, but there it is.  Let's have more politics of
grammar.  Hardly a rousing slogan.

I still think sensitive and tolerant guardianship and teaching of people
under 18, most of whom are living in households the heads of which hold
right wing or conservative political and religious views, is not the
same as collusion with instruments of oppression, and literary criticism
is not criticism of the government is not critical thinking.

Hi, Tony, & All--

For a great source: check out Hoa Nguyen's site at Teachers and
Writers--it's way beyond wonderful:

http://www.writenet.org/virtualpoetrywrkshp.html

Also, Kristen Prevallet's book, *Scratch Sides* (Skanky Possum, 2002), is
excellent for all kinds of critical-thinking-toward-writing: I've used it in
both critical prose/essay writing, and creative writing/poetry classes here
at UTA.

And my students had some good success with a few exercises I devised to go
with a composite contemporary poetry course I taught this past spring
semester--I'd be glad to discuss the course, the exercises, and the above
texts.  Email me if you'd like.


Cheers,

Chris Murray

It's important to point out that such teachers exist in all fields and on
both the right and the left.

Not only is it hardly rousing, but there are a lot of people who identify
such sentiments with right-wing politics, educational and otherwise. It's
worth thinking about something Sam Hamill wrote in "Orthodox, Heterodox,
Paradox" from his book A Poet's Work:



"Grammar is no more than a logical organization for the presentation of
thoughts and feelings. "Structure," [Wendell] Berry says, "is
intelligibility." And, "A sentence is both the opportunity and limit of
thought-what we have to think with, and what we have to think in. It is,
moreover, a feelable thought, a thought that impresses its sense not just on
our understanding, but on our hearing, our sense of rhythm and proportion.
It is a pattern of felt sense."

To permit our schools to neglect the study of grammar is to deny our
children the opportunity to explore the limits of their own thoughts and
feelings."

>>literary criticism is not criticism of the government is not critical
thinking<<



Fair enough, but they are very, very closely related, and it is crucial, I
think, to point out that, even if Bill Nevins-the guy whose situation
originally started this conversation-is someone who teaches his own politics
rather than the "reading and writing [of] poetry," what has been done to him
is still disturbing on its face and profoundly terrifying as a potential
harbinger of things to come.

Brenda Coultas won the Norma Farber First Book Award, judged by Lyn
Hejinian.  The book?  A Handmade Museum.

A richly-deserved award, and I hope I am not pre-empting someone else's
announcement to let you know.  If other Poetics list members are on the
PSA list, my apologies.  I hope someone will announce them as well.

Hi Andrew: Somehow, your post regarding the book on Cities, Queer space et
al, got disappeared. Can you resend it. I wanted to send the notice on to
Bob Gluck, a friend here in this City. Who I don't think gives any time to
the B list.

Did I copy this private post from Taylor Brady:

Stephen,

Thinking about your query on Benjamin and color while I've been reading
Lisa Robertson's Office for Soft Architecture. There's a great poetic essay
in there titled "How to Colour" that opens with Benjamin's visit to
Goethe's house -- notable for its whiteness. Lots of great stuff thereafter
on the relation between "structural" whiteness and "decorative" color,
through which Robertson goes some distance toward transvaluing that
opposition. Also great anecdotes on the short-lived transition of the
Napoleonic armies from blue uniforms to white following an embargo on
indigo from Russia. Apparently, the white uniforms fulfilled their function
of sincerity and purity a bit too well, since the reality of battle shows
up much more clearly on a white background. In response, Napoleon issued a
state policy encouraging the growth of woad in France as an alternate
source of blue pigment.

Throughout, Robertson stays focused on the slippery boundary between
pigment and color. That is, she's concerned with color specifically as
color applied to a surface -- a juice or stain. Oddly, this corresponds
with the one moment in Benjamin I could track down (though admittedly, the
search was far from exhaustive) in which color as such is thematized. The
short essay "On Russian Toys," which is appended to the English translation
of B.'s Moscow Diary, treats the coloring of Russian peasant toys as an
index of surviving handicraft production. There's very little on a sensuous
apperception of color, but some interesting stuff on the application of
coloring.

Anyway, for what it's worth. The Robertson book is worth checking out for a
number of other reasons, not least of which, given your work lately, is the
series of seven "Walks" in Vancouver and environs with which it concludes.
I'd be happy to let you borrow it for a while after I'm finished reading.

All best,
Taylor

I thought fast. I was lucky and got an idea. These two short sentences come
toward the end of Zosia Goldbergs remarkable account of how she managed to
live through the nightmare years of the Second World War, and they
encapsulate the spirit of the entire story she tells us. Like a female
Odysseus, this beautiful and resourceful young woman needed more than
simple courage to overcome the dangers that surrounded her. Survival
demanded cunning, quick thinking under pressure, a ferocious will to adapt
to the most frightening and intolerable conditions, and sheer dumb luck....

RUNNING THROUGH FIRE is a book filled with unspeakable horrors but it is
told without a shred of self-pity. Zosia Goldberg never complains, never
bemoans her lot. She battles and endures, and in this raw, unvarnished tale
of human suffering, she has given us a manual of hope.


 From Library Journal:

An account of deep personal heroism ... as suspenseful as any novel....
This work shows how a strong, resourceful woman (with a lot of luck)
overcame the grisly odds.

Author booed for anti-Bush commencement address
May 24, 2004, 12:38 PM EDT

NEW YORK (AP) _ Unlike financier George Soros, who drew cheers at Columbia
University for a commencement speech attacking President Bush, author E.
L. Doctorow was booed loudly during a similar performance at Hofstra
University.

In a 20-minute address to graduates at the Long Island school on Sunday,
the novelist criticized Bush's tax cuts, anti-terrorism policies and the
Patriot Act, but focused mainly on what he called Bush's "untrue" stories
about the war in Iraq _ beginning with his "mission accomplished"
declaration that major combat in Iraq had ended.

"One story he told was that the country of Iraq had nuclear and biological
and chemical weapons of mass destruction and was intending shortly to use
them on us ... but it was not true," Doctorow said.

"Another story was that the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was in league
with the terrorists of al-Qaida, and that turned out not to be true. But
anyway we went off to war on the basis of those stories."

According to Newsday, that led to a torrent of boos and catcalls that
forced Doctorow to stop talking. Hofstra President Stuart Rabinowitz
stepped to the podium and asked the audience to let him finish. "We value
open discussion and debate," he said.

This prompted applause from faculty members and some students, along with
scattered boos from others, witnesses said. Doctorow was able to continue,
further criticizing Bush for his tax cuts, "doing a very poor job of
combatting terrorism" and allowing the government to subpoena libraries
"to see what books you have taken out."

Justice Department officials have said no library records have been
subpoenaed under the Patriot Act.

The main commencement in Hofstra's football stadium drew nearly 10,000
people including 1,300 undergraduates and their families and friends.

Doctorow, perhaps best known for his novel "Ragtime," received an honorary
doctorate in humane letters. He left soon after his speech, explaining
that he had another engagement.

The reaction to his comments contrasted sharply with the response given
Soros at Columbia last week, where an audience of several hundred cheered
the billionaire philanthropist's attack on Bush's Iraq policy as
"unsustainable" following revelations about U.S. troops abusing Iraqi
detainees.

A Hofstra spokeswoman said on Monday that e-mail and other reaction to
Doctorow's remarks had been "all over the map," but on balance, "more
angry comments than positive."

"We feel that first and foremost, the commencement is a celebration of our
graduates and their accomplishments," said Melissa Connolly, assistant
vice president for university relations.

"We regret that the contents of his speech diminished the day for some of
our graduates and their families."

She said Hofstra does not screen the content of commencement speeches
ahead of time.

"To ruin my daughter's graduation with politics is pathetic," Bill
Schmidt, a retired New York City police captain, told Newsday. Sociology
professor Cynthia Bogard called the speech "totally appropriate... because
that's the world our students are entering."

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I had a cancellation for my summer workshop, so there's one opening.
So, anybody who's been on the fence about signing up, do contact me.
Here's the info again:

I will be leading a summer prose workshop, which will meet 10 Monday
evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to 10.  The dates:
June 7 through August 30 (no class June 21, August 9,  and August 16).

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

My latest book, Pink Steam, a collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, will be published this June by San Francisco's
Suspect Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker
will be reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press this fall.  I'm
the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State
and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles. I've also taught at
CalArts, Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF
Art Institute.  I'm the winner of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for
Literature and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.
Or--if you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this
email along to them.  Past classes have filled up quickly, so if
you're interested do contact me promptly.

Best,
Dodie

Thanks, Kevin. Later in the day I learned the whole thing. An

middle-brow middleclass... so to be expected.

What people are saying:

"Mark DuCharme puts language together in a way that happily resembles the
music of Harry Partch’s thoughtful brother, or the artworks of Robert
Rauschenberg’s Blue Period. That is, they’re thoroughly surreal, yet not
bumptiously so. There's dignity in his `madness' and thereby a composition
of new sense. One senses that the new sense, while playful, is also keenly
expressive of a social view.... DuCharme's poetry, with its pioneering
juxtapositions, grows on you in humor, sense and poetic beauty. Featured
amidship is a wild, 26-page alphabet zoo. And then there are the *other*
poems: realistic, even deadly, like `Provisional Kiwi,' so that we wind up
with a tough-mindedness that ranges, cinematically, from Brakhage to Bogart
and back. Love of language's dynamics dominates all"
            --JACK COLLOM

"We might say these poems pose a question: what is sincerity?  what is it,
and language, in the midst of our 'makeshift cultural capital'?  DuCharme's
poems occur at an angle where language is emptied out of all its uses, and
we find ourselves in the clearing."
            --ELENI SIKELIANOS

PROVISIONAL KIWI


Thanks, Sweetie. I would’ve nailed the heart-to-heart
But it rained, & I was cramped.
How about Friday? You look
Like you suddenly discovered
The doorbell is _not_ your voice. Which is a line that you can use
Whenever the Girl in Black appears.

Shifting modes of a disinfection
We’d latched on to scrupulously
In order to fake the next brain-teaser.
But I wanted to tell you I got used it,
It’s like sincerity, only more goring.

Let’s trash the rondo. Vivacious guest stars
Blur the luxury of a cool apartment.
Johnny get down from there!
You’ll hurt your toes. But the mood grows
Obstinate as plastic spasms
We have the electric bulb to thank for.

Now, let’s talk about us:
You have become one of my very favorite pests.
I’ve been wondering a lot about this idea of gnashing.
Some days, I’m a fruit peddler.
I can’t bother myself.

Subject: FBI ADBDUCTS ARTIST, SEIZES ART - HELP URGENTLY NEEDED

May 25, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FBI ABDUCTS ARTIST, SEIZES ART
Feds Unable to Distinguish Art from Bioterrorism
Grieving Artist Denied Access to Deceased Wife's Body

          DEFENSE  FUND ESTABLISHED - HELP URGENTLY NEEDED

Steve Kurtz was already suffering from one tragedy when he called 911
early in the morning to tell them his wife had suffered a cardiac arrest
and died in her sleep.  The police arrived and, cranked up on the
rhetoric
of the "War on Terror," decided Kurtz's art supplies were actually
bioterrorism weapons.

Thus began an Orwellian stream of events in which FBI agents abducted
Kurtz without charges, sealed off his entire block, and confiscated his
computers, manuscripts, art supplies... and even his wife's body.

Like the case of Brandon Mayfield, the Muslim lawyer from Portland
imprisoned for two weeks on the flimsiest of false evidence, Kurtz's
case
amply demonstrates the dangers posed by the USA PATRIOT Act coupled with
government-nurtured terrorism hysteria.

Kurtz's case is ongoing, and, on top of everything else, Kurtz is
facing a
mountain of legal fees. Donations to his legal defense can be made at
http://www.rtmark.com/CAEdefense/

FEAR RUN AMOK

Steve Kurtz is Associate Professor in the Department of Art at the State
University of New York's University at Buffalo, and a member of the
internationally-acclaimed Critical Art Ensemble.

Kurtz's wife, Hope Kurtz, died in her sleep of cardiac arrest in the
early
morning hours of May 11. Police arrived, became suspicious of Kurtz's
art
supplies and called the FBI.

Within hours, FBI agents had "detained" Kurtz as a suspected
bioterrorist
and cordoned off the entire block around his house. (Kurtz walked away
the
next day on the advice of a lawyer, his "detention" having proved to be
illegal.) Over the next few days, dozens of agents in hazmat suits,
from a
number of law enforcement agencies, sifted through Kurtz's work,
analyzing
it on-site and impounding computers, manuscripts, books, equipment, and
even his wife's body for further analysis. Meanwhile, the Buffalo Health
Department condemned his house as a health risk.

Kurtz, a member of the Critical Art Ensemble, makes art which addresses
the politics of biotechnology. "Free Range Grains," CAE's latest
project,
included a mobile DNA extraction laboratory for testing food products
for
possible transgenic contamination. It was this equipment which triggered
the Kafkaesque chain of events.

FBI field and laboratory tests have shown that Kurtz's equipment was not
used for any illegal purpose. In fact, it is not even _possible_ to use
this equipment for the production or weaponization of dangerous germs.
Furthermore, any person in the US may legally obtain and possess such
equipment.

"Today, there is no legal way to stop huge corporations from putting
genetically altered material in our food," said Defense Fund spokeswoman
Carla Mendes. "Yet owning the equipment required to test for the
presence
of 'Frankenfood' will get you accused of 'terrorism.' You can be
illegally
detained by shadowy government agents, lose access to your home, work,
and
belongings, and find that your recently deceased spouse's body has been
taken away for 'analysis.'"

Though Kurtz has finally been able to return to his home and recover his
wife's body, the FBI has still not returned any of his equipment,
computers or manuscripts, nor given any indication of when they will.
The
case remains open.

HELP URGENTLY NEEDED

A small fortune has already been spent on lawyers for Kurtz and other
Critical Art Ensemble members. A defense fund has been established at
http://www.rtmark.com/CAEdefense/ to help defray the legal costs which
will continue to mount so long as the investigation continues. Donations
go directly to the legal defense of Kurtz and other Critical Art
Ensemble
members. Should the funds raised exceed the cost of the legal defense,
any
remaining money will be used to help other artists in need.

Camilo Mejia Goes to Prison for His Stance Against the War in Iraq, While a
Campaign to Free Camilo Begins

by Medea Benjamin

"Where is the justice?" cried Maritza Castillo, whose 28-year-old son Camilo
Mejia was found guilty of desertion on May 21 for refusing to return to
Iraq. "The American soldier who tortured Iraqi prisoners was sentenced to
one year in prison and my son, who denounced these abuses and followed his
conscience, was also sentenced to one year in prison. Is that fair? Is that
just?"

At a court martial trial in Ft. Stewart, Georgia on May 19-21, Staff
Sergeant Camilo Mejia Castillo, known by friends and supporters simply as
Camilo, was sentenced to the maximum penalty of one year in prison,
reduction in rank to private, and a bad-conduct discharge for refusing to
return to Iraq.

"What an incredible irony that we're prosecuting soldiers in Iraq for
violations of international law and we're prosecuting a soldier here because
he refused to do the same things," said former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, a member of Camilo's defense team.

Camilo's stellar team of lawyers and experts, including West Point graduate
and Vietnam conscientious objector Louis Font and international law
professors Francis Boyle and Jules Lobel, threatened to make the trial an
explosive indictment of the entire war. And given the global outrage against
the torture of Iraqi prisoners, the defense planned to show that months
before the abuses became public, Camilo had already spoken out against the
cruel treatment of prisoners, as well as the slaughter of civilians and the
needless deaths of American GIs.

But military judge Col. Gary Smith quickly squelched those plans, ruling out
issues related to the legality of the war, the abuse of prisoners, and
Camilo's conscientious objector claim. By denying all the defense motions,
the judge denied Camilo the possibility of a fair trial. The defense was
forced to argue the case on the narrow technical grounds that Camilo thought
he was not under military jurisdiction because he had already fulfilled his
8-year commitment and because as a Costa Rican citizen, he could not be
forced to involuntarily remain in the US military. The 8-person military
jury saw no merit to these claims and ruled that Camilo had illegally
abandoned his platoon.

The military was determined to make an example of Camilo to stop other
soldiers from refusing to fight. His commander in Iraq, Capt. Tad Warfel, a
man Camilo accused of unnecessarily endangering the lives of his soldiers to
further his career, gloated after the trial. He said the guilty verdict
would send a message that "deserters are punished, regardless of their
excuses."

Camilo Mejia's journey from obedient soldier to fierce opponent of the war
was an 8-year ordeal. He spent three years in the Army before joining the
Florida National Guard, and was deployed to Iraq in April 2003. During his
six-month deployment, Camilo received a promotion to squad leader and
commendations for his courage and commitment. He was, according to his
commanding officers and the men under him who testified at his trial, an
exemplary and popular soldier.

But unbeknownst to the other soldiers, Camilo was changing as he experienced
the horror of war-the firefights, the ambushes, the excessive use of force,
commanders who put glory over good strategy, soldiers who were untrained and
underequipped. He watched the Iraqis quickly turn from welcoming to hostile,
"At first they were happy to see us. Then we started setting up roadblocks,
raiding their homes, killing civilians, and their attitude changed," he
recalled. "The people didn't want us there any more, and we didn't want to
be there."

He was also deeply disturbed by the abuse of Iraqi prisoners he witnessed.
In fact, months before the appearance of the Abu Graib photos, Camilo
complained to his superiors about conditions at a makeshift detention camp
near the Baghdad airport where Iraqis were arbitrarily arrested and
detained, and where he and his men were directed by three unidentified
interrogators to "soften up" prisoners for questioning. They were taught to
stage mock executions, clicking pistols near the ears of hooded prisoners,
or to bang on metal walls with sledgehammers to keep prisoners awake for up
to 48 hours.

In October 2003 Camilo went home on a two-week leave to deal with his
immigration status. It was during that leave that he had a chance to reflect
on all he had seen and done in Iraq. He realized that the war was based on
lies about weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al Qaeda, and that the
subsequent claims of saving Iraqis from a brutal dictator were a cover up
for the real aim of this war: controlling the country's oil and other
resources, and gaining a permanent military foothold in a strategic part of
the world. He decided he could not, in good conscience, continue to
participate in an "immoral, oil-driven war".

On March 15, 2004, surrounded by his family and supporters from the anti-war
movement, Camilo surrendered to military authorities and filed for discharge
as a conscientious objector. He became the first veteran from Iraq to
publicly challenge the morality of the war and refuse to fight. "Acting upon
my principles became incompatible with my role in the military," Camilo
declared as he turned himself in. "By putting my weapon down I chose to
reassert myself as a human being,"

Camilo maintained that stance of courageous resistance throughout his court
martial trial. Both his testimony and his statement before sentencing were
riveting. Poised, articulate and charismatic, he talked about how innocent
Iraqis were killed "as if they had no names, no family, no feelings." He
spoke about the unacceptable loss of US lives by commanders who put their
troops at risk for medals and promotions. He claimed that he was responding
to a higher authority, his conscience. "I will sit behind bars a free man,
knowing that I did the right thing," he declared. "I have no regrets."

In the coming weeks, Camilo will get a hearing on his application for
conscientious objector. The outcome of that hearing, however, does not
directly affect his prison sentence, although an approval might enhance his
appeal prospects.

While Camilo's case did not get the kind of press attention it deserved, he
has put a public face on the widespread disillusionment among the soldiers
in Iraq and among many in the military leadership. According to the
Pentagon's own survey, morale among the troops in Iraq is perilously low,
and some 600 troops have failed to return from their furloughs. Since the
start of the war, thousands of soldiers have called the GI hot-line that
gives soldiers legal advice about military discharges and conscientious
objector status.

"Camilo will be remembered in the history books as the first in a long line
of soldiers who rose up and helped bring an end to the occupation of Iraq.
He will not be remembered as a deserter, but as a hero," said Gael Murphy of
Code Pink, a women's peace group that has been supporting Camilo and his
family. Code Pink held vigils outside the base during the trial, and even
protested on the base itself when the guilty verdict was delivered.

Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers' fame agreed that Camilo is a hero.
"Sergeant Mejia served his country bravely and well in Iraq; but he is
serving his country better, and just as bravely, in his refusal to
participate further in what he correctly identifies as an illegal war using
illegal means."

Meanwhile, Martiza Castillo-a woman of tremendous strength and resolve
despite the fact that she barely speaks English and is desperately short of
funds-is spearheading a campaign on her son's behalf. She is asking Amnesty
International to consider him a Prisoner of Conscience, she is raising money
for his appeal, she is pushing the Costa Rican government to advocate for
his release, and she plans to speak out to the press and the public. "I will
not rest until my son is free and the US troops are out of the Iraq," said
Maritza defiantly. "This is not the end of my son's case; this is just the
first battle."

. . . . .

Medea Benjamin is co-founder of Code Pink and the human rights group Global
Exchange.

raising funds, translating to and from Spanish, contacting the press, and

Exit Strategy
How to leave Iraq in three simple steps.
By George Saunders
Posted Monday, May 24, 2004, at 8:29 AM PT


It is clear we are at a crossroads in Iraq. Naysayers are claiming the
situation there is chaotic and confusing. Nonsense. It is not confusing.
It is quite simple.

Allow me to explain.

There are, at present, two major constituencies in Iraq: those who want to
kill us, and those who do not. Success will require minimizing membership
in the former group. Complications along this path may include the
following:

1) In the process of killing the ones who want to kill us, we sometimes
kill some who are not trying to kill us. This has been observed to cause a
sudden increase in the number who want to kill us, which means a longer
stay for us, since we then must kill, not only the ones who originally
wanted to kill us, but also the ones who just started wanting to kill us.

2) In order to identify the ones who want to kill us, it is necessary,
once we have caught someone who wants to kill us, to encourage him/her to
help us identify others who want to kill us. Sometimes we mistake ones who
don't want to kill us for ones who do, and catch them, and encourage them.
Upon their release, there occurs a sudden increase in the number of those
who want to kill us.

3) Given the large number of us over there, it should come as no surprise
that some of us are bad. Certain abuses have occurred. However, it is only
fair to note that many more abuses were occurring before we arrived. Plus,
if our abusers are abusing over there, they are not abusing over here. So
really, it is a win/win: The Iraqis have fewer abuses than they were
having, and we have fewer abuses than we would have had had our abusers
stayed at home. Everyone is happy, except, it has been observed, those who
were abused and those who hear of the abuse and suddenly join the group of
those wanting to kill us.

Since it is clear that we cannot leave until they stop killing us, and
equally clear that they will not stop killing us until we leave, I propose
the following exit strategy:

1) Kill all the ones who are trying to kill us, in such a way that none of
those who presently do not want to kill us suddenly start wanting to kill
us.

2) At the moment of the death of the last person who wanted to kill us,
race quickly out of the country before some additional person suddenly
decides he/she wants to kill us, thus necessitating our continued presence
in Iraq, in order to kill him/her.

3) Having left Iraq quickly, do not look back, so as not to witness
individuals claiming they would have liked to kill us, which would then
necessitate a return to Iraq, in order to etc., etc. (See No. 2, above.)

To implement this exit strategy, we will have to practice running quickly.
It is further recommended that, while running, the eyes be cast down, to
avoid witnessing any last-minute people trying to kill us. We will have to
establish excellent communications so that the moment that final person
begins dying, we can all begin running quickly at the same time, eyes cast
down, quickly, to our vehicles, to get to the airport and get out of the
country.

This exit strategy will demand a high level of coordination, dedication,
and planning.

But our leaders have already shown the way by showing that, if one has a
vision, and refuses to betray that vision by modifying it, or becoming
distracted by small details, such as, for example, the confusing data
emanating from the non-theoretical world, filled with actual people, pets,
clothes on clotheslines, nuanced loyalties, etc., mountains can be moved,
nations can be changed, great things can be accomplished.

It is clear that the fate of Iraq now rests in the hands of Iraqis.

People of Iraq, I say to you:

Stop trying to kill us, so we can leave. But also, do not fear. We are in
it for the long haul, although we cannot stay with you indefinitely. No,
as soon as you stop trying to kill us, believe us, you will never see us
again. Therefore, trust us, people of Iraq, have faith, we assure you: As
long as you continue trying to kill us, we will never abandon you.

Creek renamed in Burroughs' honor
By Richard Gintowt, lawrence.com writer
Wednesday, May 26, 2004
To some it's a ditch, a tributary or a concrete tunnel.
        =A0=A0
But the East Lawrence stream officially is now Burroughs Creek, in=20
honor of famed Beat author William S. Burroughs, who once lived nearby.

The U.S. Geological Survey Board on Geographic Names has approved, 7-0,=20=

the proposed name change submitted last fall by the Lawrence City=20
Commission on behalf of the Brook Creek Neighborhood Assn.

Formerly named the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Tributary, the new=20
Burroughs Creek will appear on the USGS National Map within a couple of=20=

weeks.

Roger Payne, executive secretary for the USGS Board on Geographic=20
Names, said the unanimous approval came after "surprisingly little"=20
debate.

"I suspect that because of the nature of Mr. Burroughs and the=20
high-profile nature of the case, the board members probably had thought=20=

about it many times well before the meeting," Payne said.

The request received special attention, he said, because of Burroughs'=20=

controversial reputation. In addition to his literary accomplishments,=20=

Burroughs was a drug addict, a bisexual, and in his younger years shot=20=

and killed his wife during a party stunt.

The name change had some opposition in Lawrence, most notably from=20
Douglas County Commissioner Jere McElhaney, who said Burroughs promoted=20=

a "revolutionary lifestyle." McElhaney contacted Payne prior to the=20
board's vote.
=A0=A0=09
Burroughs "had a certain group of followers ... which is fine; that's=20
their choice," McElhaney said. "But not everybody liked his books and=20
not everybody liked his writing and not everybody liked his lifestyle.

To me, somebody's trying to put Burroughs up on a pedestal that he=20
should not be on."
Such views failed to sway the board.

"Apparently there was no need to have much in the way of discussion=20
regarding his character," Payne said.

Honoring the writer
The vote marked a victory for the Brook Creek Neighborhood Assn., which=20=

had been pushing the name change in conjunction with a $3.9 million=20
city project to rebuild the stream to alleviate flooding problems. That=20=

stretch of creek is being converted from drainage pipe to a natural=20
open stream in a project scheduled to be complete by January.
        =A0=A0
Though the name change drew support from the Lawrence City Commission=20
and Lawrence Parks and Recreation Department, the Douglas County=20
Commission did not endorse the proposal, instead choosing to remain=20
silent on the matter.

For longtime Burroughs friend and estate executor James Grauerholz, the=20=

re-naming of the creek was not so much about celebrating Burroughs'=20
lifestyle as it was about his literary contributions and importance to=20=

Lawrence's history.

"This doesn't mean like, =91The victory of the hippies' or something,"=20=

said Grauerholz, who wrote a letter to the City Commission in support=20
of the proposal. "Burroughs is not actually famous for accidentally=20
killing his wife or being a narcotics addict or being homosexual ...=20
he's famous for being a great writer, and because of that we know about=20=

these other things."

Kirsten Roussel, former president of the Brook Creek Neighborhood=20
Assn., has been following the proposal's progress from its inception=20
two years ago.

"I'm very glad," she said. "I do recognize that Mr. Burroughs was a=20
colorful character, to say the least, but he is part of the history of=20=

Lawrence, and this seemed a fitting way to memorialize that."
Burroughs, author of "Naked Lunch," lived out his last years in=20
Lawrence. Other cities he called home included New York, New Orleans,=20
Morocco and Mexico.

He died in Lawrence of a heart attack on Aug. 2, 1997. He was 83.

Hello unto you,

Enjoy the following...

******************************
MEL CHILIANIS: PUNK-ARSE FLUTE
http://www.sleepybrain.net/melos.html
******************************
"At university, it was always the most prissy, boring people who played the
flute. So I made it my business to play it in the most crazy and aggressive
way I could. Now, I am getting back into its naturally resonant sound, and
quite unapologetically, too." MELANIE CHILIANIS, 2004

Melanie Chilianis, a Melbourne flautist, presents a sample of her latest
output in MP3 format: a successful union between the instrument she made her
name with, the flute, and technological mixes, patches and crunchy
electronic treatments. Also features an exclusive interview.

Four downloads, as follows:

Flute 1 (128kbps; 1'11"; 1MB)
"Very flutey, undulating with a kind of yearning (my girlfriend calls it the
Whale Conversation Pit)."

Flute 2 (128kbps; 0'22"; 364KB)
"Pulse driven, using sounds in the raw derived from pencils and rulers."

Flute 3 (128kbps; 0'56"; 884KB)
"Vocal sounds that stretch and mutate."

Flute 4 (128kbps; 0'58"; 912KB)
"Made as an interlude for a Neopoetry piece to accompany a transitional
moment. The only one that uses a synth sound."

******************************
24 HOURS IN 24 DAYS
http://www.sleepybrain.net/24.html
******************************
A Behavioural Modification Program (BMP) commissioned by the Ballard
Institute for the Study of Eroto-Responsive Kinetics, Canberra in the
interests of conditioning Sleepy Brain editor Simon Sellars against
utilising excessive instances of the pronoun "I" in his fiction and non
fiction writing.

The exercise is this: Sellars takes one photo of his immediate environment,
daily, at incremental hours, starting at 1pm the first day; 2pm the next and
so on until 24 hours and 24 days are used up. Short commentaries of exactly
24 words will accompany each photo, recording his thoughts at that point. An
alarm worn on his person will alert him to the appropriate time.

Sellars will refrain from using the pronoun "I" in any of the commentaries.
If he slips up and lets even one "I" go through to the keeper, then an alarm
of a different pitch will sound. At that point, he will take a straight
razor and carve a notch into his forearm for each "I" used, until he has
learnt the lesson of selfless denial.

The end result will be 24 photos, 576 words of commentary, a less
self-indulgent, more dynamic writing style and, hopefully, no self-inflicted
wounds.

I would strongly recommend the front web pages of both the NY Times and
Washington Post today.
The NY Times delivers a particularly strong expose of the top-down direction
of the torture in Iraq, as well as in Afghanistan. It's a disgusting
portrayal of both the conscious intent to violate the Geneva accords, and
the execution of such in the so-called "interrogation" of prisoners. An
accompanying article on the Contract workers (enforcers and so-called
translators) is blood curdling (that one is either in the Times or the
Post).

 I find this all totally disturbing and frightening to read. From the
President and Rumsfeld down the chain of command, these are clearly folks
who early on in both Afghanistan pursued a criminal course of behavior.
(Right, George, we know exactly what you mean when you say, "Stay the
course." )Or the memory bells now go off about the Administration's refusal
to sign an agreement or withdraw from an agreement for the US to be under
the jurisdiction of the World Court. At that time foresight for this gang -
to save their skins from international judgment at the Hague - I am sure
they now consider good hindsight.

The fright comes from a more and more growing awareness that the country was
subjected to a coup in the last election. Indeed we are being led by crooks.
The very man who developed the criminal interrogation techniques in
Quantanamo (sp?) and brought them (unmuzzled dogs, shackles, deprivation,
race and sex humiliation, asphyxiation, actions that led to murder) to Abu
Ghraib is - in response to the photos - appointed by Rumsfeld & Co. to be
the reform head of the same prison! It seems to me clearly an attempt -
clearly now now not working - to cover their own arses from criminal
accusations.

It's no wonder that we are getting high level "terror threats" from this
Administration which can be easily interpreted as entirely cynical means of
taking the eye off these crimes. No terrorist acts - as much as these
creatures have stimulated the greater likelihood of another Twin Tower type
civil disaster - means that Bush folks can say how could they are protecting
the country from such attacks.

Is it too much to imagine or ask that the Senate demand that our own
internal Occupation forces (Rumsfeld & Company) be removed by June 30 - the
same date sovereign power is due to replace the Occupation government in
Iraq? Let's hope there are enough of us to push Congress to go beyond the
language of "incompetent" - which they are - but call 'criminals criminals."
Such should be the same for Cheney and Bush - tho I suspect we will have to
wait for the election to the make their removal democratic.

Then let the World Court do its job on these folks - it's perhaps one of the
few ways that the that the perhaps now "quaint" image of the USA as a
democracy will get a start on some much needed international and domestic
cleansing. These folks have definitely - it appears to me, anyway -
converted a "War on terror" - however that may be defined - into what many
of the world now interpret, ironically, as an American war dedicated to the
principles "of and for terror."  Not in our name, indeed!

Meanwhile the NY Times is having to confess that it, too - including its
prize reporter, Judith Miller -  fell hook line & sinker and did not
rigorously investigate the stories of WMD and biological weapons fabricated
by Challabi - which the Bush folks used to foment the War - for whatever
crazy, now disastrous reason - they so much wanted.

*Public News Network by Jack Stenner*
A computer-based artwork giving viewers "the power to
interrogate corporate broadcast media." Using a 3-D
navigable space, with Internet-transmitted objects
representing news broadcasts, to synthesize ideas from
multiple disciplines the work encourages the audience to
question their preconceived understanding, providing the
"opportunity for a new
understanding via chance juxtapositions and a re-
sampling of existing content."


*Toward the Glass Bead Game by Joshua Fost*
A realization of writer Herman Hesse's "Glass Bead
Game.” The piece associates small images with ideas in
ordinary prose developing a new vocabulary of glyphs,
which are later "assembled in special ways, such that
their spatial arrangement asserts symbolic relationships
between the corresponding ideas."

This from an astounding blog kept by a Palestinian student, Mohammed, who
lives in Rafah.  I am lately struck by how many times I have read appeals
for witness: outside Abu Ghraib, in Rafah, in Falluja: a primary desire by
human beings who suffer these kinds of injustices seems to be that others
simply recognise and understand the injustice. Inside that plea is a belief
in the basic decency of other human beings.

26  May 04=20

Still  up till now no one knows the exact number of people who were
killed in this last massacre. Streets are completely damaged,
trees uprooted, a very large number of houses have been demolished,
and all vehicles, taxis and cars, are lying damaged in the
street.=20

At about 7 a.m., the news spread among people that the Israeli Occupation
Forces have withdrawn from Tal Al Sultan. People rushed to
the damaged areas to see what had happened, and everyone wanted
to know what happened to their homes and that of their neighbours.
It looked an earthquake had struck. Israel  called this incursion "
Operation Rainbow." Israeli  sources say in the Israeli media that the
operation has not ended, and that Israeli troops might get back anytime whe=
n
they feel it necessary.

The ending of that incursion comes with a very sad beginning of homeless
families in every corner of Rafah. Tents have sprung up. One
of the homeless children, a 15 years old girl, spoke to journalists
and lead them to her room where her books and bedroom had
been completely burnt by the Israelis..

It is the first time that one of the attacks and incursions in Rafah
takes such full media coverage throughout the world, but still
the question remains: does the message of the Rafah homeless
families really reach the world?!
...=20

Tens of people were killed and over 300 were injured and nearly 1785
Palestinians became homeless, in addition to total damage
of the Rafah infrastructure. all streets have been damaged.

I was  asked to deliver this urgent appeal: the farmers of Tal Al
Sultan area are appealing to the whole world to find a solution
for them. They have lost their land and there will be no chance
to bring food for their families.. One of those left homeless was 40 years
old Abdurrahman Dahleez who has 13 members in his family,
most of whom are children. Only five minutes after his house
was demolished he began talking to me saying: "They demolished
my house, they demolished my land, and they took away the
future of my family." His wife began collecting some of whatever remained
from the rubble  of her house, and she asked: "I don=B9t know where
I should go with my children."

Dahleez family were only family out of many homeless families since
the beginning of the Intifada, and their lives have rapidly
changed. After living in dignity in their humble house that
consisted of three rooms and his small land from which he
brought food for his family, to nothing now.

Dahleez doesn=B9t have any kind of political activity. He is a
simple man with a simple life. all he wanted was for his children
to grow up happy.=20

Dave Dellinger: The Life of a Nonviolent Warrior

by Greg Guma ; May 26, 2004

Dave Dellinger's journey began in Wakefield, Massachusetts, a suburb of
Boston. His dad was a well-connected Republican lawyer and a friend of
the state's governor, Calvin Coolidge - a native Vermonter, by the way,
who went on to become president. One of his grandmothers was a member of
the Daughters of the American Revolution. His father's ancestors can be
traced back to North Carolina, before the American Revolution. In fact,
Benjamin Franklin was a direct ancestor, by way of one of Franklin's
grand nephews and a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. Quite a pedigree for
an American radical!

By the mid-1930s, it looked like Dave was on the fast track to a career
in law or government. But he already saw a different direction. He had
been picking up ideas - and you know how dangerous they can be! Ideas
from philosophy and economics, from radical Christians and college
friends like Walt Rostow. Rostow was advocating communism at the time,
but Dave questioned its approach and lack of a spiritual dimension. He
wasn't very surprised when Rostow changed sides later, backing war in
Southeast Asia, in his words "to save them from Communism." Dave also
drew inspiration from his love of nature and the campaigns of Gandhi in
India, and by getting to know his fellow workers during a summer job in
a Maine factory.

In his autobiography, From Yale to Jail, Dave recounted an incident at
Yale that changed his life. It happened after a football game between
Yale and Georgia. Tensions between the Yale students and "townies" were
high. Imagine Dave and his friends taking home a section of the goal
posts as a trophy of victory. In any case, they were set upon by some
local toughs. In the ensuing fight, Dave decked one of them - and then
experienced revulsion at what he'd done. Here's how he explains what
happened:

"The lesson I learned was as simple, direct and unarguable as the lesson
a child learns the first time it puts its hand on a red-hot stove: Don't
ever do it again! But the pain I felt was a spiritual pain, as if I had
suddenly emerged from a fit of anger and realized that I had pressed a
child's hand onto the stove. I knew that I would never be able to strike
another human being again."

That moment also showed him something else: how sadness and shame can
lead to love and change. He stayed with the young man he had hit,
apologized, and walked him home. As they parted, Dave felt what he
called "the power of our unexpected and unusual bonding." The impact of
the encounter stayed with him.

ON THE ROAD

The world eventually came to know Dave Dellinger as an activist
dedicated to nonviolence. But the path he took had many turns, and at
one point, as a student, he was tempted to pick up a gun. The year was
1936, and he was on his way to Oxford University on a fellowship to get
a doctorate. As he recalled it later, during the sea voyage the ship's
radio announced that Francisco Franco had launched a military attack on
the Popular Front, which had come to power the previous February.

Arriving in Spain, he saw the non-hierarchical communal settlements
established by the Front and stayed at the People's University in
Madrid. As Franco's soldiers advanced toward the city, he even
considered joining the resistance. If his friends were going to die, he
thought, he was ready, too. He also believed that the help of the
Communists, who had mostly come from other countries, might lead to
victory. But in the end, he couldn't ignore the grim reality: Communists
were shooting Trotskyists and both were shooting anarchists. In fact,
while he was in Barcelona, some anarchists even fired at his car.

He didn't choose the gun. Instead, he came to a conclusion that has
informed his activism for the 65 years since then. He puts it this way:
"Whoever won in an armed struggle, it wouldn't be the people."

A year later, back in the States, he hit the road. Rejecting the
comfortable path before him, Dave walked out of Yale. Wearing his oldest
clothes and without any cash, he traveled around the country, riding
freight trains, sleeping at missions, standing in bread lines, even
begging for money. Off and on, this journey continued for the next three
years, following a path inspired by Francis of Assisi. In his
autobiography, Dave described that experience:

"In a way, my whole trip was a first experimental step down the road
Francis had traveled, rejected his heritage as the son of a rich
Florentine merchant, living the life of the poor, even kissing the
leper. Now as I felt a wonderful new sense of freedom, it was Francis
who filled my thoughts.

"Oddly, the image that came to mind was not of Francis doing what I was
doing and what the poor often have to do, asking for help from those who
consider themselves superior. Rather it was the image of Francis kissing
the leper. I didn't kiss anyone and no one kissed me, but I couldn't get
the image out of my mind. Finally I concluded.that I had become the
leper. By unashamedly approaching the healthy and asking for food, I was
affirming the rights of society's lepers. And I was asking the people I
approached for more than money or food. I was asking them to come a
little closer to being Saint Francis."

LOVE, WAR, AND PRISON

The 1940s were not easy times to oppose war and promote nonviolence.
Pacifists found themselves alone as most liberals and leftists in the
anti-war movement supported "preparedness," collective security, and,
once Germany attacked Russia, entry into the conflict. Eerily enough,
some of the same terminology and arguments are being used today.

Back in 1940, Dave was living and working in Harlem, while studying at
the Union Theological Seminary. He wasn't planning to become a minister,
but did hope to deepen his radical insights. However, when the
conscription law was passed in 1940, he opted not to accept an exemption
because of his status as a seminarian. Instead, he and several others
refused to register for the draft.

His reasons for opposing the unfolding "world war" were complicated. He
knew about corporate support for Hitler and the Nazis. He had also
visited Germany, and concluded that there was potential for internal
opposition. In general, he saw the war as a geopolitical chess game
rather than a fight against tyranny and racism. Beyond that, he couldn't
stomach having an exemption when so many others, especially Blacks,
didn't want to kill but were given no choice.

His decision not to register soon led to two of the most important
events in his life: meeting the love of his life, the woman with whom he
would spend the next 60 years -- Elizabeth Peterson, and going to jail
for the first time.

But not in that order. First, he was sentenced to a year in the Danbury
federal prison. Early on, because he sat in the Black section during a
Saturday movie, he was put in solitary confinement. And then, when he
refused to answer to a number or submit to harassment by a guard, he was
thrown into the notorious Hole.

Some prisoners were broken by the experience. But for Dave, it led to
another breakthrough. He explained:

"For no reason I can explain, I began to discover how little it mattered
where you are or what anyone does to you. I was sure that what I had
done to get there was right and somehow the longer I was there the
better I felt. Maybe that wasn't it at all, but anyway I never felt
better in my life, even if I was shivering and wished I had something to
eat, or a cigarette.

"I felt warm inside and filled all over with love for everyone, everyone
I knew and everyone I didn't know, for plants, fish, animals, even
bankers, generals, prison guards and lying politicians.Why did I feel so
good? Was it God? Or approaching death? Or just the way life is supposed
to be if we weren't so busy trying to make it something else?

"It didn't matter why. The only thing that mattered was that it was
happening."

After getting out of the Hole, Dave was targeted as a troublemaker. But
his commitment to ending racial segregation in the prison brought him
new allies, especially among the Black prisoners. There were more
threats and more days in solitary. Dave didn't wavered, even when
Communist prisoners -- who at first considered him a hero - then decided
he was a "fascist coward" once Germany invaded the Soviet Union.

Shortly after getting out of prison, Dave was invited to speak at a
National Conference of the Student Christian Movement in Ohio. But
before that happened, Pearl Harbor was attacked and World War II was
fully underway. It was hard to know what would happen next. He might
even be arrested in the middle of his anti-war talk! Instead, he got an
enthusiastic response, and several requests for interviews. One of the
students interviewers was a Betty Peterson, from Pacific College in
Newburgh, Oregon.

She also opposed the draft, had worked with Mexican migrant workers, and
was interested in Dave's commune experience. While their first meeting
lasted only minutes, it was obviously enough to make a big impression.
Dave immediately called a woman who wanted to marry him and called it
off. On February 4, 1942, only a month after they had met, Dave and
Elizabeth were married.


BUILDING A MOVEMENT

Throughout the war years, Dave, Elizabeth, and their comrades in the
peace movement resisted repression -- and risked arrest -- as they
continued to struggle against the tide. A demonstration at the Capitol
in 1943 led to another prison term for Dave, this time two years at the
prison farm just outside the walls of the Lewisburg penitentiary. During
that sentence, he joined a strike to end segregation and fasted for
weeks to stop prison censorship and the use of the Hole. The protesters
won a small victory that time, ending the censorship of mail and reading
material.

By the time Dave was released in 1945, Elizabeth had given birth to
their first child, Evan Patchen, and was living at a Pennsylvania apple
farm. Before long, between picking apples and working on a nearby dairy
farm, Dave had teamed up with Bill Kuenning and Ralph DiGia to launch
Direct Action, a magazine reflecting their militant opposition to war
and faith in the power on nonviolent action. Dave's first editorial
looked at the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He wrote:

"Hiroshima and Nagasaki were atomized at a time when the Japanese were
suing desperately for peace. The American leaders were acting with
almost inconceivable treachery by denying that they had received
requests for peace.The bombs were exploded on congested cities filled
with civilians. There was not even the slightest military justification,
because the military outcome of the war had been decided months earlier.


"The war for total brotherhood must be a nonviolent war carried on by
methods worthy of the ideals we seek to serve. The acts we perform must
be the responsible acts of free men, not the irresponsible acts of
conscripts under orders. We must fight against institutions but not
against people.

"There must be strikes, sabotage and seizure of public property now
being held by private owners. There must be civil disobedience of laws
which are contrary to human welfare. But there must be also an
uncompromising practice of treating everyone, including the worst of our
opponents, with all the respect and decency that he merits as a fellow
human being. We can expect to face tear gas, clubs and bullets. But we
must refuse to hate, punish or kill in return."

TOWARD LIBERATION

It's common to hear that the 50s, and even the early 60s, were times of
conformity and repression. The Korean War, McCarthy Era, and the Cold
War, plus the deadening banality of mainstream society. Father "knew"
best, and the "American dream" was in full regalia. But there were
storms brewing beneath illusion of calm, and Dave was part of that shift
in the winds of change. Here's just a taste of what he was up to:

Direct Action was succeeded by Alternative, Individual Action, and
finally Liberation, a venerable magazine which lasted for 20 years.
Countless writers, some unknown and others prominent from the 60s
onward, contributed to this groundswell of radical thought. Their names
include A. J. Muste, Bayard Rustin, Sid Lens, Barbara Deming, Paul
Goodman, Staughton Lynd, Kay Boyle, David McReynolds, Tom Hayden, Tod
Gitlin, Dorothy Day, Daniel Berrigan, E.F. Schumacher, Robin Morgan,,
Thomas Merton, Howard Zinn, Art Kinoy, Murray Bookchin, Allen Ginsberg,
Noam Chomsky, and many more.

And despite how that time is depicted, there were antinuclear
demonstrations and civil disobedience actions, like a 44 person,
two-week fast in Washington in April 1950 against the Hydrogen bomb.
There were marches and Freedom Rides in the south, solidarity actions to
bridge the people-to-people gap between Cuba and US after 1959, protests
with Martin Luther King in the civil rights movement, and a series of
nonviolent committees and organizations - Peacemakers, the Committee for
Nonviolent Revolution, the Fellowship of Intentional Communities, and,
of course, the War Resisters League.

Through this period, Dave and Elizabeth lived and worked in an
intentional community, as well as with the Libertarian Press. They were
also working internationally, with campaigns of liberation in Europe and
the colonized world. It was called the Third World, but we know what
that really meant.

FROM THE PENTAGON TO CHICAGO

Here's how Dave described the tumultuous period leading up to the March
on the Pentagon in 1967, the historic protests at the Democratic
National Convention in 1968, and the show trial of the Chicago Eight in
1969:

"The anti-Vietnam War movement did not start in a vacuum. It was the
offspring of previous movements for justice and peace. And like a lot of
children it had to fight its way against the efforts of its parents to
prevent it from straying too far outside the compromises they themselves
had made with conventional society. In some ways, I was cast in the role
of being an older brother in these conflicts, someone who was old enough
to be importuned to side with the parents but was more frequently drawn
to stand with the rebellious kids."

Everyone should have that kind of older brother! Going up against the
national "peace leaders" of his day, Dave, along with Ralph DiGia, Dave
McReynolds, Joan Baez and a handful of others, often sided with the SDS
- Students for a Democratic Society, which came on strong beginning in
1965 with a call for a national antiwar demonstration. After that
demonstration, Dave was jailed again -- and threatened with charges of
treason. But when some of his fellow prisoners heard about that, they
refused bail unless the threats were dropped. Faced with true
solidarity, the government backed off.

The next year Dave visited Vietnam for the first time, personally
witnessing the ruthless conduct of the war, visiting with US POWs, and
getting the Vietnamese side of the story from Ho Chi Minh. Dave says Ho
never spoke harshly on Americans, although he did criticize the US
preoccupation with money and materialism. They talked about Harlem - Ho
had worked for a Brooklyn family after World War I - the poverty of
Black people, and how anti-Communist paranoia had led the US into a
series of arrogant mistakes. Before they parted, Ho Chi Minh offered a
final message:

"We do not want to humiliate the Americans or make it difficult for them
to return home. If they finally decide to let us live in peace and to
take their soldiers home where they can lead safe and honorable lives,
we will have celebrations for them. Our girls will bring flowers to the
boats as they get ready to sail away and our musicians will pay songs
for them.

Dave didn't completely buy that, but he was captivated and impressed by
the revolutionary leader. And the visit did lead to a series of other
visits Dave helped organize until the war ended.

By 1967, the death toll in Vietnam was rising, and the antiwar movement
was gaining incredible momentum. People were burning draft cards, and a
link was finally being forged between antiwar activists and leaders
within the civil rights movement. Dave also played a crucial role in
that alliance. As the slogan for the October, 1967 protests, march, and
civil disobedience in Washington urged, it was time to move "From
Protest to Resistance." And that included a dramatic plan to shut down
the Pentagon.

The impacts of those events, and others like them around the world, are
still being felt today. By 1968 -- From Berkeley to Prague, in Mexico
City and in Paris -- a hunger for change filled the air. Even the media
and some US leaders couldn't deny what was happening. Senator William
Fullbright called it a "spiritual rebellion" of the young against a
betrayal of national values. Returning from Vietnam, Walter Cronkite
said the only "rational way out" was to negotiate a settlement. But the
FBI and the Nixon administration had other plans - namely, to disrupt
and neutralize the antiwar movement through a covert
counter-intelligence program.

In March, Eugene McCarthy, an opponent on the war, won 42 percent of the
primary vote in New Hampshire. Soon afterward, Robert Kennedy entered
the race and President Lyndon Johnson decided not to seek another term.
On April 4, a rifle shot range out in Memphis, ending the life of Martin
Luther King. Rebellions erupted in 125 cities, leading to 20,000
arrests, and the mobilization of federal troops. In June, Kennedy was
assassinated. By July, there had been over 220 major demonstrations on
campuses across the country. On the other side of the world, in Vietnam,
10,000 US soldiers had died since the beginning of the year, more than
in all of 1967.

And then, the Democrats held their national convention. According to
Mayor Richard Daley, it was protesters and activists like Dave, Tom
Hayden, John Froines, and the others who became known as the Chicago
Eight who incited the riots that erupted in Chicago. But Daniel Walker,
who produced the official report afterward, concluded that it was
clearly a police riot. He described in detail the indiscriminate
violence of the cops, often inflicted on people who had disobeyed no
order and made no threats. Millions of people needed no convincing.
They'd seen it on TV.

Over the next year, a climate of repression blanketed the nation.
Attorney General Richard Kleindeinst called antiwar activists
"ideological criminals," and the FBI's COINTELPRO was taking hold. Both
the War - and the resistance to it -- were still escalating. Nixon was
in the White House, and the establishment was desperate for scapegoats.

Eight activists were indicted -- Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, John
Froines, Lee Weiner, Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis, Bobby Seale, and Dave
Dellinger. The basic charges were:

a) traveling across state lines "with the intent to incite, organize,
promote, encourage, participate in, and carry on a riot"

b) to teach and demonstrate the use, application, and making of
incendiary devices to further civil disorder, and

c) a conspiracy between the eight to do these things.

There was no conspiracy - except the one the government was cooking up.
In fact, some of the defendants didn't even know one another, and, as
Abbie Hoffman used to say, "We couldn't agree on lunch." But they knew
the charges were really a distraction -- persecution in disguise. So
they decided to put the government and its court on trial - rather than
win on a technicality - and to use any means at hand. They were about to
make history.

The trial ran five months, from September 26, 1969 to the following
February. There was no Court TV then, so we don't have a visual record.
But we do have transcripts, and many of the key moments made news across
the country. Some were absurdly funny, like Jerry Rubin and Abbie
Hoffman showing up for court in judges robes or the day the defendants
rolled in a cake to celebrate Bobby Seale's birthday. When Judge Hoffman
ruled the cake out of order, Bobby replied: "You can arrest a cake, but
you can't arrest the revolution."

At other times, the trial took on the character of an inquisition. And
perhaps never so clearly as on October 29, when Bobby Seale was carried
into the court, bound and gagged, his ankles and wrists chained to the
legs of his chair, for demanding his right to defend himself.

Many years later, John Tucker, a lawyer who was involved in the case,
recalled one of the most dramatic moments. "As the trial ended," he
explained, "and everyone knew Judge Hoffman was going to hold the
defendants and their lawyers in contempt of court and send them to
prison, we were asked to represent them in seeking bail pending appeal.
My first assignment was to attend court while the contempt citations
were being issued in order to make the appropriate objections and
motions to protect the record in case Bill Kunstler and Len Weinglass
were imprisoned before they could do so. Thus, I was in the courtroom on
Saturday, February 14, 1970 when the judge began the contempt
proceedings by reciting his charges against the first named defendant,
David Dellinger. 'What occurred next was the most extraordinary and
emotionally draining event I experienced in a courtroom in 30 years as a
trial lawyer."

By law, the judge was required to allow David to address the court
before passing sentence. He began be asking, "I hope you will do me the
courtesy not to interrupt me while I am talking."

"I won't interrupt you as long as you are respectful," Judge Julius
Hoffman replied.

"Well, I will talk about the facts and the facts don't always encourage
false respect. Now I want to point out first of all that the first two
contempts cited against me concerned ...the war against Vietnam, and
racism in this country, the two issues this country refuses to solve,
refuses to take seriously."

Hoffman ordered him to stop, but Dave was on a roll. "You see," he said,
"that's one of the reasons I have needed to stand up and speak anyway,
because you have tried to keep what you call politics, which means the
truth, out of this courtroom, just as the prosecution has."

Ignoring the judge's command that he sit down and shut up, Dave
continued. "You want us to be like good Germans supporting the evils of
our decade and then when we refused to be good Germans and came to
Chicago and demonstrated, now you want us to be like good Jews, going
quietly and politely to the concentration camps while you and this court
suppress freedom and the truth. And the fact is that I am not prepared
to do that.


You want us to stay in our place like black people were supposed to stay
in their place, like poor people were supposed to stay in their place,
like people with formal education are supposed to stay in their place,
like women are supposed to stay in their place, like children are
supposed to stay in their place, like lawyers are supposed to stay in
their places. It is a travesty on justice and if you had any sense at
all you would know that the record that you read condemns you and not
us. And it will be one of thousands and thousands of rallying points for
a new generation of Americans who will not put up with tyranny, will not
put up with a facade of democracy without the reality.

"I sat here and heard that man Mr. Foran say evil, terrible, dishonest
things that even he could not believe in. I heard him say that and you
expect me to be quiet and accept that without speaking up. People no
longer will be quiet. People are going to speak up. I am an old man and
I am just speaking feebly and not too well, but I reflect the spirit
that will echo throughout the world.

At this point, according to the transcript, there was applause and
"complete disorder in the courtroom." It was no exaggeration. Tucker
recalled. "As two marshals tried to hustle David out of the courtroom,
his daughter Michelle, who was 13 at the time, stood up and screamed
something like 'Leave my dad alone.' Her sister Natasha also stood and
screamed, and several marshals, there must have been at least 20 in the
courtroom, plowed into the audience and jumped on the two girls. David
yelled, 'leave my daughters alone,' shucked off the marshals like they
were a couple of annoying mosquitoes and rushed to his daughters aid,
joined by Abbie Hoffman and a spectator who leapt over two rows of
benches onto the back of one of the marshals. An army of marshals
grabbed Dave to drag him away, and the courtroom erupted. Everyone --
the audience, the press, the defendants and their lawyers -- was
screaming or shouting or sobbing. No one who was there will ever forget
it."

A NONVIOLENT WARRIOR

It's been more than three decades since the riots during the 1968
Democratic Convention and trial of the Chicago eight, and almost as long
since the end of the Vietnam War. Dave kept busy during all that time,
right up until the recent US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's hard to
even catalogue all the work, all the causes. Work with Native Americans
and in international solidarity movements from Nicaragua to Japan.
Joining in countless protests and hunger strikes. Civil disobedience
like the Winooski 44 sit-in to stop war in Central America. Meetings
with prisoners and working for prison justice. Helping to build support
for independent politics. Standing with new generations of activists in
affinity groups, opposing the nuclear arms race, war and atrocities in
Central America, the Persian Gulf, and Yugoslavia, and calling a halt to
corporate globalization.

For over 60 years, whenever US racism and imperialism raised their ugly
heads, Dave was there -- the "energizer bunny" of the global movement
for justice and freedom. His efforts were all the more heroic for being
nonviolent. Repeatedly putting himself is harm's way, he often managed,
almost miraculously, to turn antagonists into allies with the moral
force of his convictions.

As the US again went to war in October, 2001, hundreds of activists and
artists gathered in Burlington, Vermont, for a celebration of his life
and nonviolent work. It was a long overdue tribute to this remarkable
nonviolent warrior. True to form, Dave requested that the event focus
not just on him, but also on the many struggles for peace and social
justice to which he so completely committed himself. Nevertheless, the
stories told that night underlined the hopes, passions and fierce
commitments that had shaped his life. Members of his family were on
hand, as well as old friends like Howard Zinn, Dennis Brutus, Cora
Weiss, Art Kinoy, John Froines, Staughton Lynd, Ralph DiGia, Norma
Becker, and many more. At the end, Dave rose to speak, urging us to act
with love and value community.

Near the end of his life, struggling with hearing problems and advancing
Alzheimer's, Dave composed a touching poem that described his approach
to life:

I love everyone,

even those who disagree with me.

I love everyone,

even those who agree with me.

I love everyone,

rich and poor,

and I love everyone of different races,

including people who are indigenous,

wherever they live, in this country or elsewhere.

I love everyone,

whatever religion they are, and atheists too.

People who contemplate, wherever it leads them.

I love everyone,

both in my heart and in my daily life.




Greg Guma is the editor of Toward Freedom (TF), a world affairs magazine
whose board of directors Dave co-chaired for more than a decade, and
worked closely with him over the last 20 years.



As a tribute to Dave and Elizabeth Peterson, TF has produced the audio
documentary, Nonviolent Warriors, including testimonials, dramatic
scenes, and Dave's own words. To learn more, visit.

      Vancouver - An American soldier who deserted his Iraq-bound unit =
and sought asylum in Canada said the war in Iraq was illegal and accused =
the United States of committing war crimes.

      Pfc. Jeremy Hinzman, 25, defended his decision to leave his unit =
with the 82nd Airborne Division on Jan. 2, about two weeks after he =
learned his unit would be deployed to Iraq. He fled to Toronto with his =
wife and child.

      He is believed to be the first U.S. soldier to apply for refugee =
status in Canada after refusing combat duty in Iraq.

      "The Iraqi war is illegal according to international standards. It =
was condemned by most the international community," Pfc. Hinzman said =
Tuesday in a speech sponsored by an anti-war group and an Arab advocacy =
group. "If I had participated in the Iraq occupation, I would have =
participated in a criminal enterprise."

      A spokeswoman for the Fort Bragg, N.C.-based 82nd Airborne =
Division has said Hinzman could be arrested, but that the Army would not =
pursue him.

      Pfc. Hinzman served three years in the Army prior to January. He =
had applied for conscientious objector status before his unit was sent =
to Afghanistan in 2002, but the Army told him it had lost his =
application.

      The Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board is to start hearings in =
July on Pfc. Hinzman's case.

      Last week, a U.S. soldier who refused to return to his Florida =
National Guard unit after a two-week furlough last October was sentenced =
to a year in prison for deserting his unit in Iraq.

      Staff Sgt. Camilo Mejia had said that he disobeyed orders to =
return to his unit because his war experiences in Iraq made him decide =
to seek status as a conscientious objector. He later turned himself over =
to the Army.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.

                       -----------------------------

  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

Dear Friends,

I am forwarding a letter from my friend Redas Dirzys. He is an artist =
and
the head of an art school for 12 to 18 year olds in Lithuania. The =
school is
now under threat of closure under the false pretence of reorganization.

In April of 2003 Steven Eastwood and I visited the school for 5 days. It =
was
an amazing experience and resulted in a 27 minute film called Different
Systems of Chaos. I have made a website where people can download the =
film
(its in 3 parts but you still need a fast connection) in case you are
interested in getting more of a feeling for the school. The address is
http://www.yesandnu.com/Alytus.html.

Sincerely,
anya

Here is the letter from Redas:

Dear People of the World,

My name is Redas Dirzys and I am an artist, and the head of the Art =
School
in the small town of Alytus of the small country Lithuania. First, I =
want to
announce worldwide more than just the fact of attempts of the local
authorities to close the art school. The major thing I want to call your
attention to is the license, arrogance and cynicism of the =
functionaries,
that you=B9re noticing around yourself too, and the mechanisms they are =
using
to highlight their power. This is not a fear of losing my job; please =
don=B9t
treat it as a desperate attempt to ask for a support of the school.

The story is very simple: local authorities decided to close perfectly
functioning schools for visual arts and for musical education and to =
join
them to the training school for folk crafts. The whole unit they decided =
to
call the Artistic Training Center. The basic thing of the whole
reorganization is the appearance of the classical bureaucratic pyramid,  =
all
under this mechanically made unit, with the main task properly to =
properly
administrate these bastard artists.

The official motivations for this step is: better coordination of the =
joint
events of these three former institutions (common participation in city =
or
the state or international celebrations and projects) and better =
opportunity
to get bigger money from European foundations. The step is warranted on =
the
thesis that there is not such kind of infrastructure of the State Art
Schools in the countries of EU, even they are trying to prove that the =
EU
officials are insisting not to support this kind of schools from the =
state
money and the mostly funny argument is: there is not such a kind of =
schools
in Denmark (Danish educational system is the standard for the Lithuanian
educational system to be turned into. 10 years ago Danish experts were =
the
first to came to Lithuania with the money of European foundations to =
ensure
the way of Danish educational system to be taken as an example).

The methods: the chief of city educational department issued the order =
for
the heads of the schools to prepare the documentation for the =
reorganization
of their institutions to look as they are asking for those themselves. I
gave everything to the press what already means in this former soviet
country that I have no chance to win that fight (anyway I=B9ve already =
refused
from the same amount of salary in a new planned Artistic Training =
Center).
So, I am turning all that activity to a biggest social performance I =
ever
did =AD to play the game till the end with the full spread of =
imagination.

I am inviting everybody to react to the fact in the way they find out
convenient for themselves by writing the letters from abroad =AD to let =
the
authorities of the small city of the small country to be seen from a =
wider
prospective, or to propose them some much spectacular way to deal with =
the
artistic education. Anyway they are asking now for another alternative =
ways
what to do with the artistic education?

Please use the following email addresses to send the letters: =
info@ana.lt
and saule@ana.lt . The addresses are from the local main daily of Alytus
city and for a whole south Lithuanian region Alytaus Naujienos (Alytus =
News)
=AD the most influential for the region who have also kindly agreed to =
work
for that.

Sincerely,
Redas Dirzys=20

Whoah. What are other people’s feelings on this piece?
I’m willing to take Kent Johnson’s agit-prop
indictment of the poetry-world to heart (however it
may be constructed in the piece – academic,
experimental, web-based, whatever); but it’s only a
mirror-image of what I, and I’d suspect others, are
already up to viz. an awareness of one’s complicity,
not doing enough, etc – and I’m not American (or
British).

I know Johnson’s a provocative figure in American
poetry (and in this list’s history), and no-doubt he’s
the most outspoken critic (from the left) of the
collusion of resistant/critical poetries and academic
institutions and, well, modes of authorship which
remain largely unchanged after L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, and
I’d like to see a full-blown discussion of the
strengths, failings, etc, of his argument.

Does the centripetal movement of poetic energies
(around the individual author/name) which smacks of
hypocrisy and acquiescence to some (including me at
times – but then, I’ve got little at stake compared to
many) need redress? I’m sure I’m not the only one
who’s long been struck by the irony that many of the
de-centered works one encounters (at least by what I
would consider the canonical experimentalists --
Bernstein, Andrews, Silliman, Jarnot, to name a few I
know of) tend to be instantly recognizable or bear the
stamp, trace, and hell, whynotsayit, poetic VOICE of
their author.

Part of me thinks Johnson’s critique  (as I continue
to deploy ‘him’ as my critical shield) merely wants
the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E crew to come out from behind the
curtains, stand in a neat row, and read some sort of
statement to the tune of “He, he, sorry folks, turns
previous calls for the death of the author were
exaggerated by some of us. Actually, we like our name
recognition and quite enjoy the privileges, symbolic
and otherwise, of being muckity-mucks. Thank you.”

It’s kind of an old saw.

Even in prose, zero degree writing shifts voicing away
from a body onto the text or language, as such, but
this shift doesn’t alter the material reality of
production and distribution, or does it? This is a
serious matter for anyone on the left who expects or
would like poetry to do some serious work re: the
social, no? (Come on you Marxists and Benjaminites!)

Ron Silliman, has stated previously on his blog, that
a poem is only fully meaningful, at least for him,
when attached to (under) its maker’s name (and this
against discussions of New Critical tendencies in his
comments box of late; see also the little ‘contest’ he
ran a few months ago on the subject). While at the
same time he’s stated on his blog to the effect that
he dislikes titles because they pre- or overdetermine
the work’s possibilities for surprise, newness, and
heterogeny (and, I think, all, or almost all of
Silliman’s longer works bear this idiosyncratic stamp
in the fact of their one-word titles).

Anyway, I know almost zilch about theories of
heteronymity (if that’s the word).

Anyone want to jump in here? (and thanks for sticking
it out for my whole post)

At least 2,000 killed in Haiti, Dominica floods
www.chinaview.cn 2004-05-28 10:36:35

††††HAVANA, May 27 (Xinhuanet) -- The floods caused by
rainstorms in the Dominican Republic and Haiti have
killed at least 2,000 people,government institutions
and humanitarian organizations revealed Thursday.

††††Last week, a fierce tropical storm lashed the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola shared by the Dominican
Republic and Haiti. The Soleil river originating from
Haiti overflowed after days of heavyrains.

††††Rescuers have recovered 233 bodies in the town of
Jimani, 280 km southeast of the Dominican capital of
Santo Domingo. In addition, 122 people were taken to
hospital, but about 375 people remained missing, the
Emergency Operations Center (COE) said.

††††Dominican President Hipolito Mejia visited the
area Thursday and declared it a disaster area and
territory of public calamity. He ordered an official
mourning day for the victims.

††††The Catholic Church, Dominican aid institutions
and non-governmental organizations began to distribute
clothes, food and medicines from the United States,
the European Union, Canada and several South American
nations.

††††The rainstorm also caused many deaths and damage
in Haiti. Humanitarian and aid groups said it claimed
1,666 lives, and the number of the missing was still
unknown.

††††The interim government and international agencies
stepped up efforts to provide aid for several towns
hit by floods and large-scale mudslides. International
assistance has began to arrive in the country.

††††Haiti suffered much more serious damage. About 8
million peopleare in poverty, and only a quarter of
them have drinking water.

Calif. court considers whether violent poetry is criminal
- DAVID KRAVETS, Associated Press Writer
Friday, May 28, 2004


(05-28) 03:16 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --

The California Supreme Court is deciding whether to throw out the
conviction of a 15-year-old boy who served 100 days in juvenile hall for
writing a poem that included a threat to kill his fellow students.

The case weighs free speech rights against the government's
responsibility to provide safety in schools after campus shootings
nationwide.

Attorneys for the San Jose boy, identified as George T. in court
records, described the poem Thursday as youthful artistic expression.
One passage says: "For I can be the next kid to bring guns to kill
students at school." Another reads: "For I am Dark, Destructive &
Dangerous."

"This is a classic case of a person expressing himself and trying to
communicate his feelings through a poem," attorney Michael Kresser told
the court, which gave no clear indication what it would do. A ruling is
expected within 90 days.

Chief Justice Ronald George and other justices wondered aloud whether
George T.'s statements were protected speech because they were presented
as verses in a poem.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Laurence replied: "The First Amendment
doesn't protect against criminal conduct."

The law in question, usually invoked in domestic violence cases, carries
a maximum one-year term for criminal threats that convey an "immediate
prospect of execution." The lower courts found that this threat met that
definition, a decision the boy's attorney argued was unfounded.

Civil rights and free-speech groups were closely following the dispute.

"At the heart of this case is the First Amendment right of any young
person to explore the whole range of his emotions and experiences, and
write about disturbing subject matter without fear that he will be
punished should his work be misinterpreted," said Ann Brick, an American
Civil Liberties Union attorney.

A student frightened by the poem notified a teacher, who called police.
The boy, now 18, was arrested the next day and expelled from Santa
Teresa High in San Jose.

Justice Marvin Baxter was unsure whether the justices could second-guess
the lower courts. "How can we conclude that the threat was unequivocal?"


Justice Joyce Kennard suggested there was no immediacy to the threat and
therefore no crime was committed. "The poem doesn't say 'I will be the
next kid to bring guns to school.' It says, 'I can."'

Justice Janice Rogers Brown said the First Amendment doesn't shield
works of art with unlawful intentions. She asked whether a bank robber
could be immune from charges for giving a bank teller this note:

"Roses are red. Violets are blue. Give me the money or I'll shoot you."

Speaking for the state, Laurence said the boy's poem cannot be analyzed
in a vacuum. The boy passed the poem to a girl in his English class 11
days after a student killed two classmates and wounded 13 others at
Santana High School in Santee on March 5, 2001.

"You have to look at it all in context," Laurence said.

Kresser said after the hour-long hearing that the boy's prosecution was
an exaggerated response to Santee as well as the 1999 Columbine High
student shooting that left 15 dead, and other student attacks.

Outside of court, Laurence said the case might have been harder to prove
if the poem was written in a poetry class, or the events at Santee had
not just occurred.

In one of California's first attempts to prosecute a schoolchild under
the criminal threats statute in 2002, a Sacramento-based appeals court
overturned a boy's conviction for drawing a picture of a police officer
being shot in the head. That boy was previously arrested by the officer
on drug-related charges, and he submitted the work to his art class. An
appeals court ultimately reversed that conviction, saying there was no
immediate threat of harm.

Prosecutions of students under the statute are rare, but continue: on
Wednesday, a 14-year-old boy was arrested at a middle school in the San
Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek after posting a cartoon on the Internet
with a caption that referred to a teacher, reading: "Maybe I should kill
him and urinate on his remains."

========================

Beat Thing is David Meltzer's truly epic poem - an engagement with history &
his own participatory & witnessing presence. If the title at first suggests
a nostalgic romp through a 1950s-style beat scene, it doesn't take long
before mid-twentieth-century America's urban pastoralism comes apart in all
its phases & merges with the final solutions of death camps & death bombs
from the preceding decade. This is collage raised to a higher power - a
tough-grained & meticulously detailed poetry - "without check with original
energy," as Whitman wrote - & very much what's needed now.
- Jerome Rothenberg

The Beat Thing sizzles as close as yesterday-with landmarks, names,
occasions-as Poet Meltzer writes us back into the beat. Everyone's still
There. As fresh as ever.
- Joanne Kyger

David Meltzer has gifted us with his beautifully written kabalistic and
unique look at the Beat Generation. He also turns his eye to the American
infrastructure of Bebop. This book comes out of his mature consciousness
like energy spray bursting from the brow of a dolphin.
- Michael McClure

David Meltzer's most important lyri-political work. A profound juxtaposition
in which the Beat Movement's meaning is resonated with the haunting of the
Holocaust and the American years of McCarthyism and Jim Crowism. Like all
great works, this entire book is single simultaneous moment in progress,
written by a poet who - in terms of the rhythms, verbal inventiveness and
the naming of figures of popular culture - is without equal anywhere.
- Jack Hirschman

David Meltzer is one of the secret treasures on our planet. Great poet,
musician, comic; mystic unsurpassed, performer with few peers. His "ear"
like we used to say and his erudition are fine-tuned and precise. A kind of
bop-perfection pervades this work.
-Diane di Prima


"how easily narrative falls into place, realizes itself through a
story-telling historian who sets out to frame a tangled constantly
permutating chaos into a familiar & repeatable story w/out shadows or
dead-ends; how impulsively memory organizes into a choir to tell a story of
what it remembers symphonically, i.e., formally; even experimentalists
practice w/in or against forms that have formed their relationship to
writing & telling stories; history is the story of writing"

-Epilogue from Beat Thing


David Meltzer is the author of many volumes of poetry, including The Clown
(Semina, 1960), The Process (Oyez, l965), Yesod (Trigram, l969), Arrows:
Selected Poetry, 1957-1992 (Black Sparrow Press, 1994), and No Eyes: Lester
Young (Black Sparrow, 2000). He has also published fiction, including The

(Rhinoceros Books, 1997), and book-length essays, including Two-Way Mirror:
A Poetry Notebook (Oyez, 1977). He has edited numerous anthologies and

=================================

Unhurried Vision by Michael Rothenberg--Underneath the art of poetry exists
the tradition of the journal-the attempt to capture and reveal the world as
it passes by. Observations, reflections, and ideas accumulate to form
connections and reveal process, content and story. Unhurried Vision is a
record of the year 1999, and continues Michael Rothenberg's experiment with
the journal. This is the year Philip Whalen became terminally ill and
Rothenberg began taking care of him, pulled together Whalen's archives and
library and edited his book of selected poems, Overtime. Political,
personal, and romantic, Unhurried Vision works to savor the impermanent,
looking at the moments in a poet's life, contemplating the body of
experience. It is the mind on a quiet stroll through longing, loss and
beauty.

Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael, is really a deeply loving
celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet, roshi, & all around
confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic odyssey through routes &
roots of living & dying; a gastronome's pleasure dome, but above all a
deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's centrality in realizing
mundane & profound instances in the everyday extraordinary. Rothenberg's raw
footage is disarming; sly, self-effacing, proclaiming, doubting, affirming.
You can read it in one sitting, say blurboligists, but it takes at least a
lifetime. & then what?

-David Meltzer

Title: Drawing Masculinities in Latino Caribbean Literature
The literary representations of Caribbean masculinities within the
grounds
of social class, race, and sexuality bring forth an interesting forum of
discussion. Experiences of displacement, immigration, exile,
transculturation, family divisions, as well as linguistic and cultural
uprooted-ness determine the representation of the Cuban, Dominican, and
Puerto Rican man. The masculine ideology that Caribbean peoples bring to
their new home in the U.S. appears either destabilized or reinforced in
the
new socio-cultural system. It is commonplace among writers of Hispanic
Caribbean origin to question masculinity as an essentialist
construction,
offering an ample variety of situations and spaces where the masculine
identity is defined. This panel will explore how traditional
constructions
of masculinity are represented, subverted, and politically contested in
Latino Caribbean texts.
Suggested topics:
o       Ethnic hyper-masculinity
o       Male archetypes and stereotypes
o       Masculinity and race
o       The figure of " el pinguero"
o       The figure of "el flaneur"
o       Masculinity and the abusive father/husband
o       Homoeroticism
o       Lies and deception
o       Masculinity and Cuban patriotism
o       Subversion of gender constructions
o       Masculinity and marriage
o       Masculine self-denial
o       Santer=EDa and Vodoo
o       Depression and suicide
o       Illness
o       Homophobia
o       Mothers fostering masculine ideologies
o       The masculine identity in domestic and social spheres
o       The ritual of dressing and grooming
o       Courting and seducing

Title: North American Avant-Garde Poetry Anthologies: Challenging
masculinities and femininities
The central purpose of this panel is to discuss the methodological and
conceptual issues developed by men and women poets in the edition of
innovative and avant-garde North American poetry and poetics anthologies
in
the last three decades of the 20th century. These issues engaged men and
women poets in a larger poetic discourse and progressive language
practices. They were connected by a linguistically innovative work,
offering an unusual perspective on otherness, objectification -relating
words to objects, discursive practice of poetry, absence of final
signification, textual resistance of the signifier, death of the author,
and ideology. In formal terms, the lack of narrative structures,
experimentation with the line and the sentence, as well as the frequent
use
of parataxis, created a strong sensation of emptiness, omissions and
obscurities, and surrounding language. Sources for inspiration were
found
through other disciplines such as social theory, philosophy,
linguistics,
and art generated at both sides of the Atlantic. In this sense,
anthologies
published by women poets like Leslie Scalapino, Lisa Jarnot, Juliana
Spahr,
or Kristin Prevallet, and men poets like Edward Foster, Leonard
Schwarts,
Dennis Barone, or Christopher Beach invite reflections on their literary
and intellectual correspondences. Were there limits to what one editor
could include in her/his anthology? Were avant-garde poetry and poetics
anthologies fundamentally different or were they simply limit cases of
other poetic modes generated by men and women? The panel is designed to
bring various scholars into conversation, and will attempt to reveal
that
anthologies were not only used as a cheap means of attracting a wider
readership but also as a means to refine and enhance various joint
poetic
enterprises. The emphasis on the role of these anthologies will
hopefully
allow for a more fine-grained analysis of the transition from challenge
to
acceptance in both women's and men's innovative poetry.
Suggested topics include but are not limited to:
o       Issues of the status of language.
o       Ways in which anthologizing mediates intention, notation and
instruction.
o       The female and male "otherness" of the poetic work.
o       The relevance of particular choices in their reference to
chronology,
selected topics, and publication media (books, magazines, or electronic
editions).

Title: "Masculinities and Gender Relations in Contemporary US Women's
Literature"
In her seminal work Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory: New
Directions
(2002), Judith Kegan Gardiner refers to what she sees as the main
features
of a feminist approach to masculinity studies. First, she argues that
men,
like women, are gendered beings. Gardiner also contends that both
masculinity and femininity are social constructions that vary culturally
and historically, that is, they are culture-specific and context-bound.
At
the same time, she acknowledges that masculinity is not a monolithic,
static entity, but varies according to the particularities of race,
ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, age, etc. Finally, she rejects
essentialist approaches to gender whereby masculinity is seen as fixed
by
nature, and psychological or sociological laws.
According to Gardiner, one of the central tenets of a feminist approach
to
masculinity studies is that both masculinity and femininity are mutually
dependent and interrelated, rather than separate entities. In light of
her
comments, then, this panel will use a feminist perspective to explore
the
representations of masculinities and gender relations in contemporary
women's literature. Special emphasis will be placed on women's
literature
which provides insightful critiques of traditional patriarchal values.
More
specifically, the session will explore the different ways in which
contemporary American women's fiction re-presents both men's
relationships
with women and with each other. Finally, the panel will also discuss how
masculinities and gender relations are determined by the specificities
of
race and ethnicity, sexualities, class, age, etc., and how fiction by
women
re-writes these interrelations.

Title: "Gender Issues in American Life-writing"
Given that Life-writing is now a privileged site for thinking about
issues
of writing at the intersection of feminist, postcolonial, ethnic,
identity,
disability, masculinity, queer, and postmodern critical theories, among
others, this panel will explore the presentation and the negotiation of
sexual and gender identities and its rhetorical strategies in all kinds
of
life-writing (autobiography, biography, diaries, journals, letters, etc,
but also all forms of personal representation in art and photography=85)
in
the American literary traditions of all times.
Suggested specific topics include (but are not limited to):
"       The Poetics of Difference
"       "Autogynography"
"       Feminist Theory and Personal Narratives
"       Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Self-Portraiture
"       "Biomythography"
"       Private and Public Selves
"       Postmodern Geographies of Identity
"       Group Identity Politics

T=EDtulo: "Gender and/in Colonial America: Visions and Constructions of
Gender in the Early Days of the Nation"
This panel session would try to explore how gender was viewed,
constructed
or reflected in colonial North America. Among the questions which can
specifically be addressed or explored are the following:
1. What patterns of masculinity and femininity did colonial writers
(literary or otherwise) propose, attack, uphold, question or challenge?
2. How have modern times approached the colonial period of North America
as
far as gender was concerned (in films for instance)?
3. How have Gender Studies approached the period and what has their
contribution been to unearthing the way gender images were articulated
in
the period?
4. What is the relationship between gender and the colonial mentality
and
how specific is the view/treatment of gender in a colonial society just
on
account of its being "colonial"?
Contributions from many different fields can be accommodated in this
panel
session. I believe that the session would be greatly enriched by the
coexistence of diverse approaches, from purely theoretical undertakings
to
more traditional explorations of social, literary, artistic or other
aspects.

Title: Discursive and Physical Limits of Identity. Cyborgs and Gender
Construction in US Culture.
Before Michel Foucault theorized on the relationship existing between
power
and knowledge, it would have been at least awkward to think of our own
epistemological and ontological identity as a power construct. Nowadays,
recent research on biotechnology proves that Foucault's theories on the
construction of identity have transcended the limits of mere
consciousness
to get comfortably installed in the physical body itself. The epitome of
such installation is what we commonly know as cyborg; a hybrid of
machine
and organism that offers a postmodern alternative to modern essentialism
and representationalism. The trope of the cyborg represents a physical
and
epistemological break signaling a "differential consciousness" that
exists
in a dynamic state of flux and development. It can stand for a kind of
oppositional consciousness and practice that Chela Sandoval terms a
"methodology of the oppressed" and which has characterized the political
standpoint of various marginalized groups in the US. Donna Haraway has
specially related cyborgs to the construction of female politics and
identity on the basis of a multiple and contradictory perspective. The
cyborg questions any identity built on the distinction between human
being
and machine, self and Other, or male and female, and theoretically
should
abolish any oppressive relation based on such dualistic distinctions.
This
panel will be dedicated to exploring the relevance of cyborgs in the
construction of identity and gender relations in the US.
Suggested topics:
-Cyber-Eroticism
-Cyborg Feminist Politics
-Transgender Identity
-Cyborgs and Postmodern Identity Construction
-Textual Cyborgs
-Cyborgs and Power
-Cyborg Dystopias
-Cyborg Democracy

Title: "Out of the Closet: Black Lesbians and Gays in African American
Literature."
Historically, literary criticism has paid little attention to black
lesbians and gay men authors and/or characters in fiction. For the most
part, and partially due to an overall homophobic attitude of the black
community itself, they have been ignored, misrepresented, excluded,
trivialized, and, at times, perceived as marginal, perverted, or sick.
In
the early Eighties, Ann A. Schokeley complained that "almost nothing
[had
been] written by or about the Black Lesbian in American Literature".
However, in the late Seventies, Barbara Smith's groundbreaking work in
claiming black feminism and/or black lesbianism for black women paved
the
way for serious studies on black queer theories. Most recently,
canonized
writers such as Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor, or Gayl Jones have dealt
with
black lesbian characters. In the same thread of thought, the biographies
of
blues women such as Billy Holiday or Bessie Smith openly show these
women's
sexual preferences. Black gay writers seem to have been more vocal than
black lesbian women. Starting with writers from the Harlem Renaissance
such
as Langston Hughes, or McKay (among others), followed by James Baldwin,
and
contemporary writers such as E. Lynn Harris who continue that tradition,
black gay writers seem to have focused on the four major themes that,
according to Emmanuel Nelson, preoccupy the black gay writer: 1) the
individual gay self, and the larger African-American community; 2) the
devastating consequences of racism; 3) the pain and the possibilities of
interracial love; and 4) the tragedy of AIDS.
The aim of this panel is to examine, analyze, and discuss texts written
by
or about African American lesbians and gay men, in view of queer theory,
as
well as to examine critical studies on the co-existence of the two
communities. Contributors are invited to reflect on and explore the
following topics (among others):
- Queer theory applied to texts written by or about black lesbians and
gay
writers.
- Queer theory applied to auto/biographies of black lesbians and gay
writers.
-  Critical response to queer texts, characters and/or writers.
-  Homophobic African-American community, black lesbians and gay men.
-  Definitions of masculinity/femininity within gay and lesbians couples
-  Coming out of the closet
-  Relationships with same sex whites- women or men.

TITLE: Lesbian Representation and Cultural Tropes
This panel would address and contrast dominant and less dominant
discourses
dealing with the portrayal of lesbian women in contemporary US culture.
It
is envisioned as a multi-genre panel, including both critical and
creative
original contributions on the theme, as a display of, and reflection on,
the cultural figure of the "lesbian woman" in the US.
Suggested specific topics include (but are not limited to):
o       Postmodern forms of representation and conceptualization of the
lesbian
in literature, film, media, political discourse.
o       Mass culture assumptions on masculinity, femininity,
homosexuality,
lesbianism and motherhood applied and the figuration of lesbian women.
o       Texts and language-informed contexts through which the depiction
of
lesbian women has contributed to popular perceptions and the creation of
dominant imaginaries on the lesbian.
o       Lesbian representation and consumer culture.
o       Lesbian women rhetoric(s) of self-representation.
o       Language, literature and imagery produced by lesbian women.
o       Texts dealing with stereotyping, lesbian women contesting
dominant
cultural tropes.
o       Possibilities of lesbian "narrative unity" (as described by
Seyla
Behabib) and for lesbian communities.
o       Possible specific lesbian attempts to rewrite US, and women's,
cultural
history.

Title: "Women, men, and two-spirit peoples: the construction and
re/vision
of Native American gendered ethnicity"
The purpose of this panel is twofold. On the one hand, it seeks to
explore
the various ways in which gender and ethnicity interact in the
construction
of images of Native American women and men. On the other hand, it
intends
to examine the contemporary subversion and re/vision of those images by
means of the berdache or two-spirit figure.
Conventional definitions of gender and ethnicity have been constructed
by
means of borders-or rhetorical markers of difference-that radically
differentiate and separate men from women, white from indian. These
dichotomies originate in and reproduce certain structures of power that
find a means of expression in prevailing conceptions of masculinity and
femininity in combination with indian-ness. Thus, indian masculinity is
ruled by the warrior image, whereas Native women are measured against
the
indian princess ideal, Tecumseh and Pocahontas serving as respective
models
for those images. After more than five centuries of cultural interaction
in
America, these fictions still help to construct reality by determining
authenticity as defined by patriarchal and colonizing power.
Together with this tendency, of utmost importance for the interpretation
of
Native American and US identity, in the past few decades we have been in
the presence of a radical re/vision of gender by means of the recovery
of
the Native traditional berdache figure. The berdache refers to people of
non-ambiguous biological sex who used to adopt occupations and demeanor
akin to the gender most commonly associated with the opposite sex, and
who
acquired a different status from both men and women in their traditional
societies. Not only has the berdache been recovered as a significant
element of difference in relation to Western gender conventions and
values
by Native writers and scholars; it has also helped theorists from both
Gender Studies and Gay and Lesbian studies prove that traditional
definitions of gender as supported by the equivalence
man=3Dmasculine/woman=3Dfeminine are simply inadequate.
Contributors are invited to examine the different implications of these
related tendencies in criticism, literature, film and popular culture.
Issues to be dealt with include but are not limited to the following
general headings: images of indian men, women and berdaches or
two-spirit
people; the ethics of Native American gender representation; the
presence
of the Native trickster's ambiguity, in-betweenness, and humor as a
means
of establishing or subverting gender and ethnic boundaries; the dialogue
between gender representations of and by Native Americans.

10) Panel Chair: =C1ngel Mateos-Aparicio Mart=EDn-Albo
Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha
E-mail: Angel.Mateos@uclm.es
Title: "Hybrid Gender in Science Fiction"
In its postmodern condition, science fiction has become increasingly
aware
of many of the most persistent obsessions of the current postmodernist
cultural context. Its characteristic presentation of "other worlds" has
been adapted to explore reality beyond previously existent boundaries,
set
classifications, clear-cut distinctions and, in general, all kinds of
cultural preconceptions. In this context, women writing science fiction
have used this imaginative impulse to create fictional hybrid-gender
characters, thus bringing up the question of gender from this
postmodernist, non-settled perspective. Moreover, the activity of women
writers in a genre traditionally considered masculine can be seen as
highly
subversive both inside and outside the frontiers of the genre. In this
sense, some contributions have been particularly interesting, such as
Ursula LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness, Octavia Butler's Dawn and
Joanna
Russ's The Female Man. The main objectives of this panel could thus be:

1. To analyze in full the hybrid gender characters in relation to
current
theoretical descriptions/constructions of gender, in these writers or in
other related science-fictional narratives.
2. To explore the culturally subversive implications of presenting
characters whose gender is not clearly defined.
3. To illustrate how the presence of hybrid gender characters is
bringing
up the question of the construction of gender is Western culture.
4. To look into other fictional characters' and readers' reactions to
the
undefined gender roles and construction.
5. To explore the erotic and sexual implications of the confrontation
with
the hybrid gender characters.

E-Mail: ozieblo@uma.es
Title: Strategies of Identity in US Theater
Issues of both gender and race have been vital in creating and
re-creating
the concept of the American, that "new man," who is "free as he ought to
be." In the twenty-first century, we can no longer speak as easily of
gender, freedom and race as could Cr=E8vecoeur. Thus, this panel will
examine
the ways in which theatrical representation has contributed to the
creation, deconstruction and re-creation of a recognizable [?] American
identity in the twentieth century, focusing on dramatists who have
struggled to subvert established dichotomies and who have courageously
brought new topics and theatrical devices onto the stage.
Suggested topics:
"       Does twentieth-century American theater present recognizable
types? How
are these used?
"       Subversion of the masculine/feminine stereotype on the Off and
Off-Off-Broadway stage as compared to on Broadway.
"       The adoption of theatrical devices used to highlight such
subversion
(e.g. Vogel's use of the "Choir" in How I Learned to Drive . . . ) by
playwright and/or director.
"       Performance and perversion of accepted codes of representation.
"       Revisions and re-assessments of traditional identities (e.g.
Hester in
Suzan-Lori Parks' Fucking A or Vivian in Margaret Edson's Wit . . .).
"       Reliance on others for one's sense of masculinity/femininity
(e.g.
Manuel's heartfelt confession: "She made me feel like I was nothing," in
Cherrie Moraga's Shadow of a Man or Arthur Miller's Willie Loman . . .
).

Title: The I and the Other in the North American Short Story
This panel will reexamine psychological and literary issues of identity
in
the North American Short Story. Papers are invited on all aspects that
explore the encounter between the I and the other, the archetypal images
of
the "double", the "shade", the confrontation of otherness, the
dialogical
relations of selfhood, fe(male) constructions of identity, and the
projections of fragmented identities and fragmented selves.
Other possible topics also include, but are not limited to:
o       The poetics of the real and the fantastic.
o       Reality and hyper-reality, the hybridity of literary forms.
o       The transgression of literary conventions of the short story.

E-mail: rockland@rci.rutgers.edu
Title: Gendering America
This panel will look at ways in which the USA is seen, shaped, and
formed
through gender. My own presentation will be: "False Gendering of
Domestic
Violence in the United States." Domestic violence is exclusively seen in
the US as an issue in which men are perpetrators, women victims, when
actual statistics indicate a 60%-40% ratio of men to women as
perpetrators/victims and vice versa. Both sexes are diminished by this
false conventional wisdom. I plan to present clips from a recent Oprah
television show on the topic as part of my presentation.
Members of the panel will want to discuss other examples of gendering in
North American life. For example: aesthetics. Henry James spoke in The
American Scene of how American men were all "downtown" (business),
American
women all "uptown" (culture), and George Santayana wrote that the arts
in
the United States struggle between vernacular (male and American) and
genteel (female and European) considerations.
Other examples of gendering are: how domestic tasks are gendered; how
public life is gendered; how fashion and beauty and the diet industry
are
gendered and, yet, with the advent of the new "Metro-sexual man," are
becoming un-gendered; how American nationalism and public monuments are
gendered. But these are just my own ideas. Any presentation which looks
at
how gendering affects culture in the United States, or even some
comparison
of gendering in the United States and in Europe, especially in Spain,
would
be welcome and would, I think, fit nicely into the general theme of the
conference.

University of Valladolid
guerrero@fyl.uva.es
Title: Male, Female and Hybrid Bodies
The body has been seen as an extremely cultural artifact and as a site
for
cultural challenge as well. It has been approached variously since the
Renaissance. Either viewed as a machine by scientists or as a model for
social organization, the body has been understood as existing
simultaneously in the natural and the cultural worlds. It has been
theorized as a body-machine, or as artificial or fantastic creatures
such
as werewolves, golems, and vampires among others. From the scholar's
point
of view this raises two questions: How has the body been configured
historically? What does it mean for bodies to be treated in this
fashion?
The panel invites proposals that study how the human body has been
represented in Literature, Arts, Cinema, and Culture. Possible topics,
though not restricted to, are: male and female identity as inscribed in
bodies, representations of new creatures that challenge traditional
concepts of masculinity and femininity, the gendered grotesque,
representations of male and/or female non-human creatures, "The New
Flesh"
in Cinema and/or Literature, representations of freaks and other
marginal
creatures.

of
America.
We want to focus our attention on the key role they have played on the
founding and development of the US nation and even, we would like to
underline the projection that most of them have had not only in the USA
but
also all over the world.
Searching for an increasingly interdisciplinary academic world should be
a
challenging task for anyone who tries to offer a deeper and more
complete
view of US culture.
We would like to be joined in this panel by contributors who deal with
relevant aspects of those women and men who have been building this
modern
nation, the United States of America. Therefore, this panel will accept
proposals which analyze any political, religious, labor or social
protagonism in the history of the American nation.

Title: "Ethnic and Gender Hybridities in Contemporary US Literatures"
The threshold or borderland in between the second and third millennia
has
been heralded by the consolidation of postmodernism and postcolonialism,
while we have also witnessed the emergence of two other controversial
post-
phenomena: post-feminism and post-nationalism/post-ethnic theory. It is
these last two -isms that the proposed panel intends to address. The aim
of
the panel is four-fold:
1st- to explore the negotiations within gender studies and ethnic
studies,
with particular attention to gender and ethnic crossings that inhere in
a
"hybrid" society
2nd- to look at the ways gender and ethnicity categories intersect,
overlap, intertwine and interface each other
3rd- to provide illustrations of these "gender and ethnic crossings", on
the one hand, and of the intersection of gender and ethnicity, on the
other, in Asian American literary production
4th- last, but not least, to negotiate and delve into the import of
these
multiple (gender/ethnic) crossings as regards the concept of hybridity.

Title: "The Dialectics of Diasporic Identification": Hybridity, Gender
and
Affiliation
Paul Gilroy's phrase (Third Text 13 [winter 1991]) reminds us of the
multiple ways in which
the term 'diaspora' currently signifies. From its historical etymology
derived from the Greek diasperien, from dia-, meaning 'across', and
sperien, meaning 'to sow or scatter seeds', the term has over the
centuries
performed its own meaning, attaching itself now to Jews forced to live
beyond the borders of Palestine, now to Africans forcibly displaced to
the
New World, and in today's global world scenario, speaking simultaneously
to
all displaced, migrant peoples of our planet, from Mexicans to Sri
Lankans,
Pakistanis to Romanians, Hondurans to North Africans.
'Diaspora', further, involves a process-or 'dialectics'-of
interpellation:
the individual is hailed, or summoned through location. This is
geography
in the service of subject formation. The contingency and provisionality
of
the arrangement is intensified by multiple variables such as history,
unstable or decentered affiliations, ideology and gender. Hybridity,
especially in its Bhabhian conception of "shifting forces and fixities"
and
its interrogation "of the images and presences of authority" (The
Location
of Culture), acquires heightened valence in our present context. This
panel
seeks contributions that engage with current formulations of the term
'diaspora' from within a theoretical context of ethnic, cultural and
transatlantic studies. We welcome also enquiries into how the term
productively intersects with constructions of sexuality and gender in US
culture.

Title: Alternative Femininities in Nineteenth-Century American Theatre
Nineteenth-century American theatre is usually dismissed by critics and
scholars as second rate to that produced during the following century.
However, it offers-from the point of view of Gender Studies-an
interesting
environment for the study of feminine stereotypes, from the upper class
theater-goer to the reviled prostitute of the infamous third tier. Much
has
been written about these passive connections of woman with theatre, but
women's relationship with the theater was not limited to spectatorship;
many women-challenging societal prejudices-made a career in show
business
at a time in which the mere notion of women earning their living outside
their home was shocking enough. Exposing themselves to the public, these
women challenged the notions of piety, purity, submissiveness and
domesticity that defined so-called True Womanhood, thus jeopardizing
their
chances of becoming socially acceptable. Whether working as managers,
critics, dramatists or actresses, many women forged a career for
themselves
while, at the same time, they set the foundations for the theatre that
women such as Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, and Rachel Crothers
would
work in during the following century.
Although all the women working in nineteenth-century theatre shared some
common features-they challenged conventions, they needed to earn a
living-they should not be labeled as a homogeneous group. For example,
novelist and amateur actress Louisa May Alcott made a point of changing
social attitudes toward actresses and women working in show business in
general, while dramatist Louisa Medina focused on society's prejudices
against women and, although she suffered social rejection she never
wrote
about it. Actress-manager Nellie Boyd toured the American Southwest in
an
attempt to take theatre to the most remote areas of the country;
meanwhile,
actress Anna Cora Mowatt spent all her career acting in big cities and
she
gained a reputation as a dramatist writing about the urban upper middle
class.
Proposed topics:
"       Women's involvement in nineteenth-century theater: as actresses,
dramatists, producers, directors, theater-managers.
"       Stereotypes of femininity: representation, presentation and
subversion of
the female image and identity.
"       Social prejudice against women in the theater.

What about George W. Bush threatening to kill someone, which he often does?
Is he immune from prosecution because he's inarticulate? This case leaves
much to the imagination.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Some thoughts on Andrew Loewen's thoughts on Kent Johnson:

Johnson's piece worked insofar as it emphasized the pathology of "American" (read: US) normality in the torturers' cheerful talk-show monologues.  Then, by bringing in the "poet"'s voice, it raised the nasty issue of class, through which so many nice, good-liberal university-educated and employed citizens distance themselves from the "trailer trash" who perpetrate such crimes.

Interesting to see that Loewen considers the LangPoets as "canonical experimentalists."  Revealing word, "experimentalist," especially as in their own ways, the post-Auschwitz, post-modern torturers at Abu Ghraib were "experimentalists" of inflicting pain and sensory deprivation (or would the average post-structuralist say, "bodily abjection"?).  Johnson's poem is a fine warning against complacent indulgence in the kind of antiseptic, tedious, monolingual and mono-tonal Anglo-American (another way to conceptualize "the coalition" in poetic terms) gibberish that often surfaces on this list in the name of "innovative language."

Regarding "modes of authorship," this is also part of the Abu Ghraib matter, where the "zero degree of writing (on the body)" translates into a "zero degree of responsibility" for the atrocities, from Bush and Rumsfeld to Karpinski and Sanchez to England and Sivits.  No one wants to claim authorship, here, so the whole thing becomes a kind of "collective text," as decentered and, yes, experimental as the perpetrators wanna be.  There are authors here, and if they may not necessarily be "dead," they're certainly in hiding.

As for "theories of heteronymity," my advice is: read Fernando Pessoa, it's all there in practice.

 From the Introduction by Paul Auster:

I thought fast. I was lucky and got an idea. These two short sentences come
toward the end of Zosia Goldbergs remarkable account of how she managed to
live through the nightmare years of the Second World War, and they
encapsulate the spirit of the entire story she tells us. Like a female
Odysseus, this beautiful and resourceful young woman needed more than
simple courage to overcome the dangers that surrounded her. Survival
demanded cunning, quick thinking under pressure, a ferocious will to adapt
to the most frightening and intolerable conditions, and sheer dumb luck....

RUNNING THROUGH FIRE is a book filled with unspeakable horrors but it is
told without a shred of self-pity. Zosia Goldberg never complains, never
bemoans her lot. She battles and endures, and in this raw, unvarnished tale
of human suffering, she has given us a manual of hope.


 From Library Journal:

An account of deep personal heroism ... as suspenseful as any novel....
This work shows how a strong, resourceful woman (with a lot of luck)
overcame the grisly odds.

This is a response from Ethan Paquin


Hi Kent,

Yes, I saw it once it came out -- I really like it quite a bit, and think
you've authored what is by far the most relevant poem for/in/about
this War.

Thanks for thinking of me.

I strongly disagree with some of the sentiments -- Croggon's, I think,
for example? -- e.g. the poem is "too easy."  It is, to me, simply a
poem that needed to be written to catalog this atrocity for future
Americans/American Consumerists Around the Globe.  "Easiness"
is beside the point.  And if it was so "easy," where have similar poems
been for the past two months?

I was thinking about issues like these (yes, I thought about the poem
all day yesterday) as I drove home from work yesterday, equally
excited that you'd written it and that Ted Pelton's site would get
more hits from Geoffrey's temp posting of the poem there. The poem
just struck me as the right thing to say, said in the right way.  No
lefty posturing;  we're all guilty together. Again, it is a poem for our
time.

You may disseminate my reply if you'd like, but I thought you'd
want to know -- not everyone out here is dissecting the thing, trying
to fit it into some "tradition," playing academic, ad inf., etc etc......
I appreciate and admire the thing, is all.

Yours,

Ethan

Subject:      Memorial Day Weekend & Iraq/ Thoughts
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Events in the prisons by our soldiers in Iraq (see article below on torture
of Iraqi women prisoners) have certainly given a unique twist - at least in
my memory - as to the significance of Memorial Day.

In fact, courtesy of the poly-cylindrical character of the Internet, we can
receive information from so many different global, geographic nodes, each
carrying materials and views that either conflict, corroborate or put up a
whole new angle on 'our' view  on whatever the provocative circumstances.

In light of example such as the new revelations of Iraqi women imprisoned,
raped and subjected to other torture by our soldiers, I am wondering if the
globe will evolve to a point where war Memorials will incorporate the
memories of all sides of a conflict. Much, for example, today is made of the
fact that the new WWII Memorial in Washington includes the acknowledgement
of the contribution of the 50 States and six territories. In my perhaps
innocent optimism, I wonder if the eventual memorial for this Iraq War will
include the acknowledgement of the torture of these men and women Iraqi
prisoners whose abused conditions once globally exposed became the turning
point in the which the American people turned on the President and demanded
an exit of its troops from an obvious disaster.

My larger question is whether an eventual Iraq War Memorial will evolve to a
point where such site will acknowledge all victims - both our own misled
soldiers and those of the Iraqi resistance. The knowledge of what has
happened in Iraq is so globally shared, it would seem entirely narrow minded
or blind to not make the site be a healing one for those we have tortured
and killed, and what all else we have contributed to destroy in heritage,
cultural and otherwise of Iraq.

If the America's refusal to acknowledge the gratuitous bombing at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki is any guide,for example, I am not about to be optimistic.
However, I do think the Internet is changing global consciousness in such a
way - let alone the shift to an interdependent global economy - that these
nationally self-serving Memorials will begin, indeed, to seem quaint.
("Quaint" in a much different sense than the President's lawyer use of the
term to unilaterally disown the Geneva War Conventions on the use of torture
on prisoners as a crime).

Fundamentally here is a wish to collectively apologize and offer reparations
for this killing, torture, and abuse. I wish there was one leader in this
Government who could offer that. It's something I would certainly support
-otherwise this nation is going to be festering and, I suspect, go badly in
the world for a long time.

Ah, with those dark thoughts, do have a good, as much as possible, weekend.

Hi Ethan and Kent:

Maybe I've been reading too much Orwell lately, and the sentiment was too
familiar: the issue of class, of bourgeois "progressives" who distance
themselves from the trailer trash whom they find in fact disgusting, seems
as relevant now as when Orwell spoke in the 1930s of English middle class
socialists who on encountering actual working class persons found their
class prejudices more embedded than they realised, and retreated straight
into the charms of Fascism.   And yes, anyone who is protesting this kind of
stuff in the Western world has to acknowledge that the clothes one wears,
the energy one consumes, the computer one writes on, the economy one lives
in, is dependent on the exploitation of the poor, especially in countries
far far away where desperate people slave in Nike factories in conditions
that aren't very far from caricatures of 19C capitalist wickedness.  One's
complicity is inescapable. I was also thinking this morning that some things
need to be said crudely because they are in fact crude.

Still: I'll stick by my wondering (like the boy in Keats' poem).  I am quite
happy to wonder. I think, with Kent, that is a good thing; I should make
clear that I am not attacking the poem. I meant "easy" not because I
necessarily disagree with the thrust of the poem, but because a logical
conclusion to draw from the poem is that any response to the outrages of
one's government, as an intellectual, as a writer, is inevitably
hypocritical.  And this is so close to the kind of things that right wing
commentators say about "chardonnay socialists" and wanker intellectuals in
this country (Australia) that it gave me pause.  Words and what one does
with them, the exposure of murderous lies, matters very much: why would our
governments spend so much ink and hot air justifying the credibility of
their actions otherwise?  And also: is a poem, even a "self righteous" poem,
really equivalent to these acts of torture? (Though I can think of certain
readings...)  And also: does Kent's response of self disgust (for so I read
it) stymie in some ways the possible humane and decent reaction to things
like torture at Abu Ghraib?  Because the humane and decent reaction stemming
from a humane empathy is the only response that has the faintest chance of
changing these things; that is, if it leads to action, which is not
historically unprecedented.

There's another point, which is the way the huge dissemination of those Abu
Ghraib photographs made us all voyeurs, participants in the act of torture,
simply by the act of looking: for by so looking, we extended the original
act of torture, which was crucially about public humiliation, about being
seen.  That was one of the taintings which I found most difficult to
negotiate about the whole business.  In that sense, I would totally agree
with Kent, but here the poem, not the act of looking, is an instrument of
torture.

Allison---

thanks for this---
a great line of thinking....

I'm very interested in exploring these questions you raise
(which for me are relevant beyond considerations of the specific poem
which I've not as of yet read---so for that reason what I have to say
here will not be referencing the specific poem except in terms of
the characterization of its position, which to me is a familiar one.
So familiar in fact that it seems to characterize in many ways the
impasse of much USA oppositional left writing/thought/speech, etc...)

Certainly it's an issue I deal with in my writing---
The impulse being the humane empathy and/or the righteous or self-righteous
poem.....or the way the humane empathy may move toward self-righteousness...
Is this something to be avoided? Perhaps, ideally....
But CAN it be avoided, is another question.
And if it CAN'T be avoided, should it be EDITED OUT?
Those three questions, in succession, I think are at the heart of your post.
I think for some people, people I admire immensely, it can be avoided--
or at least they are able to edit out in such a way that it seems
it (the self-doubts, the self-consciousness, the "when you point the finger
at someone else, you got 4 more pointing back at you," the fact or feeling
of "complicity" you also mention in your post) never occured to the person.
Yet for other people, or at other times, and for me personally,
I have tremendous difficulty editing out the self-doubts,
or what Blake might call THE IDIOT QUESTIONER, that (or who),
makes me AT LEAST CONSIDER THE POSSIBLE analogy that I, or anyone,
who speaks out of humane empathy, may in fact turn into his or her
own enemy.
Of course, ULTIMATELY, to say that writing a poem in protest of
the US invation/occupation of Iraq is just as bad as torturing Iraqis
is a futile, self-defeating gesture.
BUT, as an example of SHOWING ONE'S WORK, as going through the changes
on the issue and CONSCIENTIOUSLY considering one of the strongest OBJECTIONS
that could be RAISED by the right-wing, etc., isn't it possible that
it may actually STRENGTHEN the VALIDITY of one's position, and help ground
that human empathy?
It is not necessarily becoming a "native informer" to question the
possibility, to temper the potentially dangerous lapse into dogma that
could result from not questioning one's own position. In fact, I'd argue
that perhaps the potential liability (in a world of sound bites and
simple binaries) of self-doubting the strength of our own opposition
to bush, etc., can be made into a great strength precisely because we can
then say---UNLIKE BUSH ETC WE ACTUALLY CAN QUESTION OUR BELIEFS, AND MAKE
THAT QUESTIONING PUBLIC, AND THEY STILL STAND UP UNDER SCRUTINY.
I don't know, and don't even particularly care, if the poem in question
is able to do that. I'm not trying to defend the poem, just trying
to weigh in here with my own thoughts, and my own positions, on the
questions you raise.

thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris

I hope I wasn't coming across as arguing that one should throw away
self-doubt, or that it is wrong to rehearse these contradictions, which are
real and troubling.  I agree completely with what you're saying above.  And
yes, it's impossible to use words like "humane" and "decency" without being
aware of their impeccable right wing lineage and usage - still, I think we
have to hijack those words and use them for ourselves, most especially if we
wish to speak beyond the circle of the already converted.  It's a tactic
Michael Moore uses with great effect, I think.  And I think also that by
keeping focus on the issues of injustice which underlie our instinctive
protest at such crimes, we might be able to short-circuit the impasse which
you point out.  Ie, we should make ourselves free of intellectual
embarrassment at the possibility of sounding naive.

Yes, and Michael Moore’s medium is documentary film of
course, not poetry. And I think Moore makes great even
necessary films but he does not make great Film. So be
it, these days we need him more than most other
directors.


I think for many, poetry is too precious to be
‘deployed’ for agit-prop usage or in the service of
any old-fashioned bearing witness. Anti-poetics are
fine as long as they’re the sort read (and written) by
people who appreciate good poetry.



For another perspective on modes of political art,
there’s a remarkable interview with Gillian Slovo on
BBC 3’s Nightwaves (link below to listen) who, with
former Guardian News foreign correspondent Victoria
Brittain, has written the play “GUANTANAMO 'Honor
Bound to Defend Freedom'” being presented by The
Tricycle Theatre in London. The play’s dialogue is
pulled from transcripts, letters, interviews with
families of detainees, press conferences (by Rumsfeld
et al) in lieu of interview refusals, and so on.  It’s
well worth giving the interview a listen (it’s the
first item on Monday’s program and is available until
next Monday’s program replaces it).

click on ‘Monday’ under ‘Listen to Broadcasts’ and
then double click on the desktop file, you need a Real
One Player]


Finally:

“Perhaps what we need to do, as poets, is plug our
deepest recesses into that great and encompassing
uncertainty, fear, paradox, and, yes, dark comedy of
the current conjuncture and just see what happens.
Allow our selves to be shocked and lit up by the
horror. To be transformers, as it were. Needless to
say, there are as many cords and plugs as there are
snakes in Medusa's head; and there are as many open
outlets as there are orifices in Hades. So while we
must be bold, we need also, I suppose, to be careful
and have the polished shield handy!”

-- K. Johnson

I wasn't talking of poetry, but of the more general responsiveness to such
questions such as torture.  I realise this is a small point, but it
nevertheless seems fairly important, since from what I said you seem to dra=
w
some fairly interesting conclusions about my own poetics.  (Who are, btw,
"people who appreciate good poetry" and what happens if anti-poetics gets
into the hands of people who don't appreciate good poetry?  Should readers
who don't appreciate good poetry be forbidden from accessing such stuff?)

Agitprop - like Brecht's lehrerstuck - has its place.  But if you were
familiar with my own work, you might understand that I do not generally
write that kind of poem myself.  I'll paste my own response to the Abu Grai=
b
torture pics, written when they first appeared in late April, below.   I
should say it's not typical of my own work, and the response I chose was du=
e
to a lot of doubts I have about the unintentionally exploitative nature of
much poetry about atrocity.

Also, the documentary plays now fashionable in Britain - the Hutton Inquiry
show as well as the one you mention - do in fact do quite a lot of that "ol=
d
fashioned bearing witness".

Dear Kent, o think what terror might plague us if all the torn and
privileged and then the literati, too, keep thinking out loud: our
bathwater's going lukewarm or chaos: people might say what is really on
their minds.  Are you willing to be responsible if something crashes, shifts
and changes enough to move outward from the capital of episteme?

Dear Kent, o isn't it so much better if poetry just keeps some foaming
status-quo afloat?--something that doesn't require fuck-words, fireworks,
green, and/or greed, more or less "shock and awe," to measure, name and tame
what is continually paradoxical in western humanistic thought?

Dear Kent, o isn't the body so much better ignored?

Dear Kent, o when will you fill the silences, the silences, the histories
with more crakker-jacks?

I didn’t nor have I ever drawn any inclusions about
your specific poetics. I was noting that lots of
people think what Moore does is great, yet scoff at
more directly political poetics. Which is fine, maybe
even not of much interest – film and poetry are very
different media – but I wasn’t implying that you are
one such scoffer.

I don’t know, probably lots of interesting things, but
when I wrote “Anti-poetics are
 fine as long as they're the sort read (and written)
by people who appreciate good poetry” I was being
FACETIOUS, and, I suppose, implying that such a
sentiment is at times buried in poetics which attack
'mainstream' avenues of resistence such as the 'poets
against the war' homepage, or whatever.

Yes, aren’t they quaint?

Some things should be "fashionable" right? I hear
protests and marches have come back into style.
Satire, too, seems rather trendy. I'm okay with such
fashions.

I thought "Bowling for Columbine" was a mediocre
documentary at best, and "Stupid White Men"  can be
read in 40 minutes w/o missing much, but I still
praise Moore for both works.


Sorry, I just realized maybe it was the title of the
thread that has you thinking I was talking about your
poetics - that makes sense! Whoops.



best,

Andrew.

Isn't the idea that poetry is "precious" also rather quaint? Or was that
humour too?  Perhaps irony marks should make a triumphant return.

Debate seems to be following, perhaps inevitably, several polarisations and
simplifications.  I have no interest in attacking Kent's poem, it is what i=
t
is.  Nor am I interested in attacking Kent.  I am interested in some of the
issues the poem (consciously) provokes and sought some untangling more
interesting than this for/against kind of model which seems t be unfolding.
I am deeply interested in the politics of poetry, and often find the
question troubling.  If you take it that I am sneering at directly politica=
l
poems or other works of art, you are mistaken.  But I am wary of the many
traps such art can fall into.

Not uncoincidentally, I am listening to Eisler's "An Anti-Fascist Cantata",
condemned by the Nazis as "degenerate" art.  Lyrics are by Brecht.  It seem=
s
to me a very successful political work of art.  Brecht of course is
bracingly free from self-flagellating doubt (whether that was wholly a good
thing is another question), and doesn't mistake artistic angst for other
kinds of suffering.  Some excerpts from the libretto:

- How's the war going?
- Yesterday they bombed another hospital.
- Who?
- The ones who want to take civilisation there.
- When do the rains start again?
- In May.
- Not until May?
- The generals say that they want to defend civilisation!
- What sort of civilisation?
- The generals' one.

Epilogue:
See our children.  Stunned and bloody-faced
freed from a frozen tank, see them come.
Even the vicious wolf must have a place to hide in.
Warm them, they are going numb.  See our children.

Stephen:

I hear that to an Iraqi, a woman in prison is assumed to have been raped.
Even if her headscarf is removed, it is a form of disgrace tantamount to
rape. This is not to say that rapes didn't occur, just that rumors may
pollute the facts, which are condemning enough.

As for war memorials honoring both sides, I fully agree. The problem with
war memorials is that they are not enough against war, except, maybe, the
Vietnam War Memorial, which seems, because it is just a overwhelming amount
of names, no heroic man on a horse, no flag being planted, to have an
anti-war, meaningless-of-it-all, effect on people. Yet most Americans
learned nothing from that war. Nothing! And this seems to include John
Kerry, who's caught up in the spirit of comradeship instead of in the
insanity of war.

Bush Doctrine ; BBC Interview ; by Noam Chomsky and Jeremy Paxman ; May
21, 2004

If George Bush were to be judged by the standards of the Nuremberg
Tribunals, he'd be hanged. So too, mind you, would every single American
President since the end of the second world war, including Jimmy Carter.

The suggestion comes from the American linguist Noam Chomsky. His latest
attack on the way his country behaves in the world is called Hegemony or
Survival, America's Quest for Global Dominance.

Jeremy Paxman met him at the British Museum, where they talked in the
Assyrian Galleries. He asked him whether he was suggesting there was
nothing new in the so-called Bush Doctrine.

NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, it depends. It is recognised to be revolutionary.
Henry Kissinger for example described it as a revolutionary new doctrine
which tears to shreds the Westphalian System, the 17th century system of
International Order and of course the UN Charter. But nevertheless, and
has been very widely criticised within the foreign policy elite. But on
narrow ground the doctrine is not really new, it's extreme.

JEREMY PAXMAN: What was the United States supposed to do after 9/11? It
had been the victim of a grotesque, intentional attack, what was it
supposed to do but try...?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Why pick 9/11? Why not pick 1993. Actually the fact that
the terrorist act succeeded in September 11th did not alter the risk
analysis. In 1993, similar groups, US trained Jihadi's came very close
to blowing up the World Trade Center, with better planning, they
probably would have killed tens of thousands of people. Since then it
was known that this is very likely. In fact right through the 90's there
was technical literature predicting it, and we know what to do. What you
do is police work. Police work is the way to stop terrorist acts and it
succeeded.

JEREMY PAXMAN: But you are suggesting the United States in that sense is
the author of Its own Nemesis.

NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, first of all this is not my opinion. It's the
opinion of just about every specialist on terrorism. Take a look, say at
Jason Burke's recent book on Al-Qaeda which is just the best book there
is. He runs through the record of how each act of violence has increased
recruitment financing mobilisation, what he says is, I'm quoting him,
that each act of violence is a small victory for Bin Laden.

JEREMY PAXMAN: But why do you imagine George Bush behaves like this?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Because I don't think they care that much about terror, in
fact we know that. Take say the invasion of Iraq, it was predicted by
just about every specialist in intelligence agencies that the invasion
of Iraq would increase the threat of Al-Qaeda style terror which is
exactly what happened. The point is that...

JEREMY PAXMAN: Then why would he do it?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Because invading Iraq has value in itself, I mean
establishing...

JEREMY PAXMAN: Well what value?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Establishing the first secure military base in a dependant
client state at the heart of the energy producing region of the world.

JEREMY PAXMAN: Don't you even think that the people of Iraq are better
off having got rid of a dictator?

NOAM CHOMSKY: They got rid of two brutal regimes, one that we are
supposed to talk about, the other one we are not suppose to talk about.
The two brutal regimes were Saddam Hussein's and the US-British
sanctions, which were devastating society, had killed hundreds of
thousands of people, were forcing people to be reliant on Saddam
Hussein. Now the sanctions could obviously have been turned to weapons
rather than destroying society without an invasion. If that had happened
it is not at all impossible that the people of Iraq would have sent
Saddam Hussein the same way to the same fate as other monsters supported
by the US and Britain. Ceausescu, Suharto, Duvalier, Marcos, there's a
long list of them. In fact the westerners who know Iraq best were
predicting this all along.

JEREMY PAXMAN: You seem to be suggesting or implying, perhaps I'm being
unfair to you, but you seem to be implying there is some equivalence
between democratically elected heads of state like George Bush or Prime
Ministers like Tony Blair and regimes in places like Iraq.

NOAM CHOMSKY: The term moral equivalence is an interesting one, it was
invented I think by Jeane Kirkpatrick as a method of trying to prevent
criticism of foreign policy and state decisions. It is a meaningless
notion, there is no moral equivalence what so ever.

JEREMY PAXMAN: If it is preferable for an individual to live in a
liberal democracy, is there benefit to be gained by spreading the values
of that democracy however you can?

NOAM CHOMSKY: That reminds me of the question that Ghandi was once asked
about western civilisation, what did he think of it. He said yeah, it
would be a good idea. In fact it would be a good idea to spread the
values of liberal democracy. But that's not what the US and Britain are
trying to do. It's not what they've done in the past. Take a look at the
regions under their domination. They don't spread liberal democracy.
What they spread is dependence and subordination. Furthermore it's
well-known that this is a large part of the reason for the great
opposition to US policy within the Middle East. In fact this was known
in the 1950's.

JEREMY PAXMAN: But there is a whole slur of countries in eastern Europe
right now that would say we are better off now than we were when we were
living under the Soviet Empire. As a consequence of how the west behaved.

NOAM CHOMSKY: And there is a lot of countries in US domains, like
Central America, the Caribbean who wish that they could be free of
American domination. We don't pay much attention to what happens there
but they do. In the 1980s when the current incumbents were in their
Reganite phase. Hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered in
Central America. The US carried out a massive terrorist attack against
Nicaragua, mainly as a war on the church. They assassinated an
Archbishop and murdered six leading Jesuit intellectuals. This is in El
Salvador. It was a monstrous period. What did they impose? Was it
liberal democracies? No.

JEREMY PAXMAN: You've mentioned on two or three occasions this
relationship between the United States and Britain. Do you understand
why Tony Blair behaved as he did over Afghanistan and Iraq?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, if you look at the British diplomatic history, back
in the 1940s, Britain had to make a decision. Britain had been the major
world power, the United States though by far the richest country in the
world was not a major actor in the global scene, except regionally. By
the Second World War it was obvious the US was going to be the dominant
power, everyone knew that. Britain had to make a choice. Was it going to
be part of what would ultimately be a Europe that might move towards
independence, or would it be what the Foreign Office called a junior
partner to the United States? Well it essentially made that choice to be
a junior partner to the United States.

So during the Cuban missile crisis for example, you look at the
declassified record, they treated Britain with total contempt. Harold
McMillan wasn't even informed of what was going on and Britain's
existence was at stake. It was dangerous. One high official, probably
Dean Atchers and he's not identified, described Britain as in his words
"Our lieutenant, the fashionable word is partner". Well the British
would like to hear the fashionable word, but the masters use the actual
word. Those are choices Britain has to make. I mean why Blair decided, I
couldn't say.

JEREMY PAXMAN: Noam Chomsky, thank you.

For those tempted to vote Conservative to get back at the Liberals, take
a look at the statements from conservative leader  Stephen Harper: In
his own words...

And oh by the way, he was very disappointed that Canada did not send
troops to Iraq despite that fact that the vast majority of Canadians
were opposed to doing that.

MMN

Compiled by Mark M. Persaud

Human Rights Commissions:

"Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our
fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society...It
is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff." (BC Report
Newsmagazine, January 11, 1999)

On being 'libertarian'

"But I'm very libertarian in the sense that I believe in small
government and, as a general rule, I don't believe in imposing values
upon people." (National Post, March 6, 2004)

Economic conservatism, Harper says during an interview in his Calgary
office, is libertarian in nature, emphasizing markets and choice.
Libertarian conservatives work to dismantle the remaining elements of
the interventionist state and move towards "a market society for the
21st century." (Toronto Star, April 6, 1997)

Child Poverty:

In 1997, Harper bragged that he was opposed to government programs to
eliminate child poverty:

"These proposals included cries for billions of new money for social
assistance in the name of "child poverty" and for more business
subsidies in the name of "cultural identity".  In both cases I was
sought out as a rare public figure to oppose such projects."  (The
Bulldog, National Citizens Coalition, February 1997)

Universal Social Programs:

"Universality has been severely reduced: it is virtually dead as a
concept in most areas of public policy...These achievements are due in
part to the Reform Party..." (Speech to the Colin Brown Memorial Dinner,
National Citizens Coalition, 1994)

Bilingualism:

"After all, enforced national bilingualism in this country isn't mere
policy. It has attained the status of a religion. It's a dogma which one
is supposed to accept without question. ... [M]ake no mistake.  Canada is
not a bilingual country.  In fact it is less bilingual today than it has
ever been...As a religion, bilingualism is the god that failed.  It has
led to no fairness, produced no unity, and cost Canadian taxpayers
untold millions." (Calgary Sun, May 6, 2001)

Federalism:

"It is imperative to take the initiative, to build firewalls around
Alberta, to limit the extent to which an aggressive and hostile federal
government can encroach upon legitimate provincial jurisdiction."
(National Post, January 24, 2001, "Open Letter to Ralph Klein")

"If Ottawa giveth, then Ottawa can taketh away... This is one more reason
why Westerners, but Albertans in particular, need to think hard about
their future in this country.  After sober reflection, Albertans should
decide that it is time to seek a new relationship with Canada. ...Having
hit a wall, the next logical step is not to bang our heads against it.
It is to take the bricks and begin building another home - a stronger
and much more autonomous Alberta.  It is time to look at Quebec and to
learn.  What Albertans should take from this example is to become
"maitres chez nous". (National Post, December 8, 2000)

"[T]he Liberals still insist on meddling in provincial jurisdiction in
areas such as health care, education, and municipalities ....The federal
government should refocus on its core areas of responsibility, and allow
provinces to define their own priorities for their own societies. ...
Stephen Harper would seek to recognize, through federal-provincial
agreements, that areas of jurisdiction such as labour market
development, forestry, mining, housing, recreation, and municipal and
urban affairs are exclusive areas of provincial jurisdiction, and to
adequately compensate the provinces for withdrawing federal spending in
these areas." (Federalism for All Canadians, Stephen Harper Policy
Paper, oneconservativevoice.ca, March 2004)

"Whether Canada ends up as one national government or two national
governments or several national governments, or some other kind of
arrangement is, quite frankly, secondary in my opinion... And whether
Canada ends up with one national government or two governments or ten
governments, the Canadian people will require less government no matter
what the constitutional status or arrangement of any future country may
be." (Speech to the Colin Brown Memorial Dinner, National Citizens
Coalition, 1994)

On Atlantic Canada:

"There is a dependence in the region that breeds a culture of
defeatism," (CBC News, May 30, 2002)

"I think in Atlantic Canada, because of what happened in the decades
following Confederation, there is a culture of defeat that we have to
overcome. ...Atlantic Canada's culture of defeat will be hard to overcome
as long as Atlantic Canada is actually physically trailing the rest of
the country." (New Brunswick Telegraph Journal, May 29, 2002)

"There's unfortunately a view of too many people in Atlantic Canada that
it's only through government favours that there's going to be economic
progress, or that's what you look to ...That kind of can't-do attitude is
a problem in this country but it's obviously more serious in regions
that have had have-not status for a long time."   (Toronto Sun, May 31,
2002)

"I've taken my position and frankly it's the same position that I took
all through the [Alliance] leadership race. I delivered [speeches]
everywhere I went, including in the Maritime provinces on several
occasions, about the spirit of defeatism in the country and what drives
it and how we have to address it." (National Post, May 31, 2002)

On Canadians:

"I think there is a dangerous rise in defeatist sentiment in this
country. ...I have said that repeatedly, and I mean it and I believe it."
(Ottawa Citizen, June 3, 2002)

"Canada appears content to become a second-tier socialistic country,
boasting ever more loudly about its economy and social services to mask
its second-rate status..." (National Post, Dec. 8 2000 p. A18)

"Well I just want to assure you that those kinds of security concerns
are widely shared here. Certainly the problems in our porous borders,
our immigration system, there are things that we've been raising in the
Parliament...Make no mistake, Canada, you know, with its limited
resources, our soldiers made an adeq...admirable participation in
Afghanistan..."  (Interview with Sheppard Smith, Fox TV, September 13, 2002)

"...there is a continental culture. There is a Canadian culture that is in
some ways unique to Canada, but I don't think Canadian culture coincides
neatly with borders."  (Report Newsmagazine January 7, 2002)

"We've just become increasingly irrelevant to a country [U.S.] that has
a lot of priorities..." (CBC Newsworld, July 11, 2003)

"I think in parts of the Prairies we are increasingly seeing similar
views that there is no hope, there is no way forward, all we can do is
negotiate with the party in power. So I think in any region where you
have sustained under-development or lack of growth for a long period of
time, this starts to develop... I'd say frankly, generally the kind of
can't-do attitude is a problem in this country but it's obviously more
serious in regions that have had have-not status for a long time."
(Toronto Star, May 30, 2002)

On Western Canadian society:

"You've got to remember that west of Winnipeg the ridings the Liberals
hold are dominated by people who are either recent Asian immigrants or
recent migrants from eastern Canada: people who live in ghettoes and who
are not integrated into western Canadian society." (Stephen Harper,
Report Newsmagazine, January 22, 2001)

Regional Development:

"We have in this country a federal government that increasingly is
engaged in trying to determine which business, which regions, which
industries will succeed, which will not through a whole range of
economic development, regional development corporate subsidization
programs.  I believe that in the next election we got to propose a
radical departure from this."  (Global News, February 24, 2002)

Betty Granger:

Betty Granger was one of three Harper leadership organizers in Manitoba.
  She is a past candidate from the 2000 election whose remarks about an
"Asian invasion" created controversy:

"I'm not doing witch-hunts on people's pasts... If someone does something
wrong, there will be action taken.  But if somebody doesn't do anything
wrong, we're not going to take any action... I don't make volunteer field
decisions... but Betty Granger is a riding president, a member in good
standing.  She's somebody that other members I've talked to think very
highly of, and quite frankly, she was the victim of an unfair slur story
in the last election campaign." (Calgary Herald, January 15, 2002)

"Betty Granger is party president in the Winnipeg area and one of a
large number of party presidents that are supporting this campaign. So,
I think this kind of thing is just kind of a low-level form of
McCarthyism." (CTV "Question Period", February 10, 2002)

Spending Cuts:

Harper incorrectly predicted that the annual cuts of up to $19-20
billion to federal expenditures proposed by the Reform Party would not
be sufficient to eliminate the federal deficit:

"The proposals we made during the election which many people considered
drastic, are probably not now adequate to deal with this problem."
(Montreal Gazette, November 30, 1993)

"I do not intend to dispute in any way the need for defence cuts and the
need for government spending cuts in general. ...I do not share a not in
my backyard approach to government spending reductions." (Hansard, May
23, 1995)

On the Iraq War:

"I don't know all the facts on Iraq, but I think we should work closely
with the Americans." (Report Newsmagazine, March 25 2002)

"We should have been there shoulder to shoulder with our allies. Our
concern is the instability of our government as an ally. We are playing
again with national and global security matters.''  (Canadian Press
Newswire, April 11, 2003)

"On the justification for the war, it wasn't related to finding any
particular weapon of mass destruction. In our judgment, it was much more
fundamental. It was the removing of a regime that was hostile, that
clearly had the intention of constructing weapons systems. ... I think,
frankly, that everybody knew the post-war situation was probably going
to be more difficult than the war itself. Canada remains alienated from
its allies, shut out of the reconstruction process to some degree,
unable to influence events. There is no upside to the position Canada
took." (Maclean's, August, 25, 2003)

"The world is now unipolar and contains only one superpower.  Canada
shares a continent with that superpower.  In this context, given our
common values and the political, economic and security interests that we
share with the United States, there is now no more important foreign
policy interest for Canada than maintaining the ability to exercise
effective influence in Washington so as to advance unique Canadian
policy objectives." (Canadian Alliance Defence Policy Paper: The New
North Strong and Free, May 5, 2003)

"This party will not take its position based on public opinion polls.
We will not take a stand based on focus groups.  We will not take a
stand based on phone-in shows or householder surveys or any other
vagaries of pubic opinion... In my judgment Canada will eventually join
with the allied coalition if war on Iraq comes to pass. The government
will join, notwithstanding its failure to prepare, its neglect in
co-operating with its allies, or its inability to contribute. In the end
it will join out of the necessity created by a pattern of uncertainty
and indecision. It will not join as a leader but unnoticed at the back
of the parade." (Hansard, January 29, 2003)

"While there are Canadians who oppose the invasion, Harper said, they
are a minority, as are those who are anti-American. It certainly exists.
But in fairness, there's an anti-American sentiment among the American
left in the United States itself. We have some of that here. But that's
a minority sentiment.'" Only in Quebec, with its "pacifist tradition,"
are most people opposed to the war, Harper said. "Outside of Quebec, I
believe very strongly the silent majority of Canadians is strongly
supportive." (Halifax Daily News, April 4, 2003)

On Taxes

"I will strive to make this not the highest-spending country in the
world, but instead the lowest taxing one." (Speech at the Conservative
Leadership Convention, March 19, 2004)

"[W]e must aim to make [Canada] a lower tax jurisdiction than the United
States." (Vancouver Province, April 6, 2004)

"They (taxes) can be lower than the U.S. and that should be our
financial objective." (Canadian Press, April 11, 2003)

On being called a Tory:

"It's actually not a label I love. ... I am more comfortable with a more
populist tradition of conservatism. Toryism has the historical context
of hierarchy and elitism and is a different kind of political
philosophy.  It's not my favourite term, but we're probably stuck with
it." (Hamilton Spectator, January 24, 2004)

Directement de la source...

[Citations traduites de l'anglais]



Les commissions des droits de la personne humaine

« Les commissions des droits de la personne humaine, de la manière dont
elles évoluent, attentent à nos libertés fondamentales et à l'existence
même d'une société démocratique [...] C'est en fait du totalitarisme. Je
trouve cela très effrayant. » (BC Report, 11 janvier 1999)



Les soins de santé :

« Alors pourquoi le gouvernement fédéral va-t-il dépenser des millions
de dollars des contribuables aux fins d'une enquête sur le système des
soins de santé ? La réponse est probablement qu'il insiste pour trouver
une " solution nationale ", soit précisément le contraire de ce que le
système a besoin [...] Compte tenu d'un tel défi, il est clair qu'il
faudrait tenter diverses expériences, par exemple, intégrer dans le
régime public des mesures de libéralisation et la possibilité d'opter
pour des soins privés. Et en toute logique, puisqu'en vertu de notre
fédération, les provinces administrent les régimes de soins de santé et
réglementent les services privés, c'est au niveau provincial que ces
expériences devraient être tentées. » (Discours prononcé à
Charlottetown, 27 juin 2001)

« Les monopoles sont tout aussi inacceptables dans le secteur public
qu'ils le sont dans le secteur privé. Que les soins de santé soient
offerts par des institutions privées ou publiques, à but lucratif ou non
n'a aucune importance dans la mesure où les Canadiens y ont accès quels
que soient leurs moyens financiers. » (Allocution en réponse au discours
du Trône, 1er octobre 2002)

« M. Harper est également convaincu que notre système de soins de santé
va continuer de se détériorer si Ottawa ne révise pas à fond la loi
canadienne sur la santé pour permettre aux provinces d'introduire des
mesures de libéralisation et la possibilité d'opter pour des soins
privés. Il est prêt à défendre des positions hardies, comme
l'introduction de services privés dans le système public. » (Énoncé de
politique publié dans le cadre de la campagne pour la direction du parti
à l'adresse : harperforleader.com, février 2002)

GLORIA MACARENKO : Stephen Harper, que pensez&shy;vous de l'instauration
au Canada d'un système de soins de santé privé parallèle ? STEPHEN
HARPER / VICE&shy;PRÉSIDENT DE LA NATIONAL CITIZENS' COALITION : « Eh
bien, je pense que ce serait une bonne idée. Je crois d'ailleurs que le
Canada se dirige dans cette voie. Nous sommes les seuls, parmi les pays
de l'OCDE à envisager un système à deux vitesses, sauf que la seconde
vitesse fonctionnera à l'extérieur du pays, là où seuls les riches et
les puissants peuvent en bénéficier, ce qui ne présente aucun avantage
pour le régime de soins de santé du Canada. Je pense donc que ce n'est
pas la bonne façon de procéder. Et, c'est clair, en ce qui nous
concerne, nous envisageons une autre voie. »  (Émission de télévision de
la SRC, 17 août 1997, 23 h 00, HE)

La pauvreté chez les enfants :

En 1997, Harper s'est vanté d'avoir été contre les programmes proposés
par le gouvernement pour éliminer la pauvreté chez les enfants :

« On réclamait, entre autres propositions, des milliards de nouveaux
crédits pour l'aide sociale, en invoquant « la pauvreté chez les enfants
», et d'autres subventions pour les entreprises, au nom de « l'identité
culturelle ». Dans les deux cas, on s'adressait à moi parce que j'étais
l'une des rares personnes en vue qui s'opposaient à de tels projets. »
(The Bulldog, National Citizens Coalition, février 1997)

L'universalité des programmes sociaux :

« L'universalité a été strictement restreinte : ce concept a
pratiquement disparu de la plupart des domaines de la politique
gouvernementale [...] C'est une victoire qui est due en partie aux efforts
du Parti réformiste [...] » (Discours prononcé lors du Colin Brown
Memorial Dinner, National Citizens Coalition, 1994)

Le bilinguisme :

« Après tout, le bilinguisme national et obligatoire n'est pas, dans ce
pays, une simple politique. C'est devenu une religion, un dogme que nous
sommes tous censés accepter sans discuter [...] Ne vous y trompez pas. Le
Canada n'est pas un pays bilingue. En fait, il l'est moins qu'il ne l'a
jamais été [...] Le bilinguisme érigé en religion, c'est comme un dieu qui
n'a pas pu faire de miracles. Cela n'a favorisé ni la justice ni
l'unité, et cela coûte aux contribuables canadiens, à qui l'on se garde
bien de le dire, des millions. » (Calgary Sun, 6 mai 2001)

Le fédéralisme :

« Nous devons impérativement prendre l'initiative et couper l'Alberta du
reste du pays pour limiter la mesure dans laquelle un gouvernement
fédéral agressif et hostile peut empiéter sur les compétences
provinciales légitimes. »    (National Post, 24 janvier 2001, « Lettre
ouverte à Ralph Klein »)

« Si c'est Ottawa qui donne, Ottawa peut reprendre [...] Raison de plus
pour que les gens de l'Ouest, et plus particulièrement les Albertains,
réfléchissent bien à leur avenir dans ce pays. Après mûre réflexion, ils
devraient se rendre compte qu'il est temps que les relations entre
l'Alberta et le Canada changent [...] Le Canada semble se contenter d'être
devenu un pays du genre socialiste de deuxième classe, qui chante la
performance de son économie et les mérites de ses services sociaux
d'autant plus fort qu'il peut ainsi masquer la position où il a été
relégué et le fait qu'il est dirigé par un homme fort qui aspire à jouer
dans la cour des grands, tout à fait taillé pour l'emploi [...] Nous nous
sommes heurtés à un mur, certes, mais la prochaine étape logique serait
de ne pas s'y cogner la tête. Il est bien plus logique de prendre les
briques et de commencer à bâtir une nouvelle demeure, un Alberta plus
fort et plus autonome. Il est temps de prendre modèle sur le Québec. Ce
que les
Albertains devraient apprendre des Québécois se résume à ceci : devenir
« maîtres chez nous ». (National Post, 8 décembre 2000)

« Les libéraux tentent toujours de s'ingérer dans les domaines de
compétence exclusive comme la santé, l'éducation et les municipalités
[...] Le gouvernement fédéral devrait se concentrer sur ses principaux
domaines de responsabilité tout en respectant les responsabilités
propres des provinces. Stephen Harper va reconnaître, par
l'intermédiaire d'accords fédéraux-provinciaux, que les domaines comme
le développement de l'employabilité, la foresterie, les mines, le
logement, les loisirs, ainsi que les affaires municipales et urbaines
redeviennent des domaines exclusifs des provinces avec pleine
compensation. » (Un fédéralisme pour tous les Canadiens, document sur
les politiques de Stephen Harper, oneconservativevoice.ca, mars 2004)

« Que le Canada finisse par être représenté par un gouvernement
national, deux gouvernements nationaux, plusieurs gouvernements
nationaux ou même par tout autre type de structure, c'est franchement
assez secondaire, d'après moi...Que le Canada se retrouve avec un
gouvernement national, ou deux gouvernements, ou dix gouvernements, et
quelle que soit la façon de gouverner du Canada, ses habitants
demanderont une réduction de l'État, peu importe la constitution ou le
régime qu'on aura. » (Discours prononcé lors du Colin Brown Memorial
Dinner, National Citizens Coalition, 1994)

« Mais je suis très libertarien dans le sens où, en règle générale, je
crois qu'il faut « moins d'État » et qu'il ne faut pas imposer de
valeurs aux gens. Si je suis à la tête d'un gouvernement, je ne
chercherai pas à faire avancer la légalisation de l'avortement. Je crois
fermement au mariage, selon sa définition traditionnelle, mais je suis
aussi en faveur de la liberté de vote. Ce n'est pas quelque chose que
j'imposerais. » (Stephen Harper, National Post, 6 mars 2004)

« La définition du mot (libertarien) est discutable. Il a plusieurs
sens. J'ai tendance à me rapprocher d'un conservatisme favorable à «
moins d'État » [classique], dans la tradition libérale. Je ne me définit
pas du tout pour autant comme un « libertarien ». Mais, de mon point de
vue, le type de conservatisme que je défends s'inscrit tout à fait dans
la ligne du programme réformiste axé sur un important changement
démocratique. » (Harper, The Report, 7 janvier 2002)

Au cours d'une entrevue qui a eu lieu dans son bureau de Calgary,  M.
Harper a déclaré que le conservatisme économique est libertarien par
nature, l'accent étant mis sur les marchés et le choix. Les
conservateurs libertariens cherchent à démanteler ce qui reste de
l'État&shy;providence pour passer à une « économie de marché du XXIe
siècle. » Mais le conservatisme social est plus autocratique. M. Harper
appelle cela du « Buchananisme », du nom de Pat Buchanan, le républicain
américain de droite, partisan du populisme, qui a, sans succès, brigué
l'investiture de ce parti aux élections présidentielles. « C'est
l'orientation la plus dangereuse (du conservatisme) », a déclaré M.
Harper. « Un Buchananiste devient un critique non socialiste du système,
de certains aspects de l'économie de marché. » (Toronto Star, 6 avril 1997)

La région atlantique

« Il y a une dépendance dans cette région qui entretient une culture
défaitiste. » (CBC News, 30 mai 2002)

« Je crois que, en raison de ce qui s'est passé au cours des décennies
suivant la Confédération, il existe une culture défaitiste dans la
région atlantique qu'il nous faut éliminer. [...] La culture défaitiste
des provinces atlantiques sera difficile à éradiquer tant et aussi
longtemps que cette région sera à la remorque du reste du pays. » (New
Brunswick Telegraph Journal, 29 mai 2002)

« Il y a malheureusement un trop grand nombre de personnes dans la
région atlantique qui croient que ce n'est que par le biais des faveurs
du gouvernement qu'il y aura un progrès économique ou qu'on arrivera à
quelque chose [...] Cette attitude apathique est un problème pour notre
pays, mais c'est évidemment plus grave dans les régions qui sont depuis
longtemps défavorisées. » (Toronto Sun, 31 mai 2002)

« J'ai fait connaître mon opinion et, honnêtement, c'est la même que
celle que j'ai exprimée tout au long de la campagne pour la direction
(de l'Alliance). Partout où je suis allé, y compris dans les Maritimes,
à plusieurs reprises, j'ai prononcé des discours à propos de l'esprit de
défaitisme dans le pays, de ce qui l'alimente et de la manière d'y
remédier. » (National Post, 31 mai 2002)

Les Canadiens

« Je crois qu'il y a une hausse dangereuse du sentiment défaitiste dans
ce pays. [...] Je l'ai dit souvent. Et je le pense. Et j'y crois
fermement. » (Ottawa Citizen, 3 juin 2002)

« Eh bien, permettez&shy;moi de vous dire que nous partageons tout à
fait ces préoccupations à propos de la sécurité. Évidemment, les
problèmes que posent nos frontières trop ouvertes, notre système
d'immigration, sont des questions que nous avons soulevées au Parlement...
Ne vous y trompez pas, le Canada, vous savez, avec ses ressources
limitées [...] nos soldats participent de façon adéq... admirable aux
interventions en Afghanistan. » (Entrevue avec Sheppard Smith, Fox TV,
13 septembre 2002)

« ... il existe une culture à l'échelle du continent. Il y a, au Canada,
une culture qui, par certains côtés, est unique, mais je ne pense pas
que la culture et les frontières se superposent exactement. » (Report
Magazine, 7 janvier 2002)

« Nous avons simplement perdu de plus en plus d'intérêt aux yeux d'un
pays [les États&shy;Unis] qui a un grand nombre de priorités... »
(Entrevue, Newsworld, CBC, 11 juillet 2003)

« Je crois qu'il y a une hausse dangereuse du sentiment défaitiste dans
ce pays. [...] Je l'ai dit souvent. Et je le pense. Et j'y crois
fermement. » (Ottawa Citizen, 3 juin 2002)

« Je crois que dans certaines régions des Prairies, on entend de plus en
plus d'opinions semblables disant qu'il n'y a pas d'espoir, qu'il n'y a
pas d'issue, que tout ce que nous pouvons faire est de négocier avec le
parti au pouvoir. Alors je crois que dans n'importe quelle région qui
souffre de sous-développement ou d'une absence de croissance pendant une
longue période, c'est cette opinion qui se développe [...] Je dirais
franchement que ce genre d'attitude défaitiste est un problème dans ce
pays, mais c'est encore plus évident dans les régions qui ont eu un
statut de déshéritées pendant longtemps. (Toronto Star, 30 mai 2002)

À propos de la société canadienne de l'Ouest

« Il ne faut pas oublier qu'à l'ouest de Winnipeg, les circonscriptions
libérales sont dominées par des gens qui sont soit des Asiatiques
immigrés de fraîche date, soit des Canadiens originaires de l'Est : des
gens qui vivent repliés sur eux-mêmes et qui ne sont pas intégrés à la
société canadienne de l'Ouest. » (Stephen Harper, Report News Magazine,
22 janvier 2001)

Le développement régional

« Nous avons dans ce pays un gouvernement fédéral qui est de plus en
plus décidé à déterminer quelles entreprises, quelles régions, quelles
industries prospéreront, et lesquelles ne réussiront pas, en utilisant
une panoplie de programmes d'octroi de subventions en faveur du
développement économique et du développement régional. Je crois que dans
la prochaine campagne électorale, nous devons proposer de rompre
totalement avec cela. » (Global News, 24 février 2002)

Betty Granger

Betty Granger a été l'une des trois organisatrices de la campagne de M.
Harper pour la direction du parti, au Manitoba. Elle a été candidate aux
élections de 2000. Les remarques qu'elle avait alors faites sur le «
péril jaune » avaient suscité la controverse :

« Je ne fais pas de chasse aux sorcières, je ne fouille pas le passé des
gens [...] Si quelqu'un a fait quelque chose de mal, des mesures seront
prises. Mais si rien de mal n'a été fait, nous ne prendrons pas de
mesures [...] Je ne prends pas de décisions volontaires sur le terrain [...]
mais Betty Granger est présidente d'une association de circonscription,
elle est membre en règle du parti. C'est une personne que les membres à
qui j'ai parlé tiennent en haute estime et, très franchement, elle a été
la victime d'une campagne diffamatoire injuste lors de la dernière
campagne électorale. » (Calgary Herald, 15 janvier 2002)

« Betty Granger est la présidente de l'association du parti dans la
région de Winnipeg et elle compte parmi les nombreux présidents
d'associations politiques qui soutiennent la présente campagne. Je crois
donc que ce genre de chose n'est qu'une sorte de maccarthysme qui vole
très bas. » (Émission « Question Period » sur CTV, 10 février 2002)

La réduction des dépenses

M. Harper s'est trompé lorsqu'il a prédit qu'une réduction de 19 ou 20
milliards de dollars par an des dépenses fédérales, comme le proposait
le Parti réformiste, ne suffirait pas à résorber le déficit fédéral :

« Les propositions que nous avons formulées durant la campagne, et que
beaucoup de gens trouvaient draconiennes, ne conviennent probablement
pas, aujourd'hui, pour résoudre ce problème. » (Montreal Gazette, 30
novembre 1993)

« [...] je n'entends aucunement contester la nécessité de réduire les
dépenses de la défense et les dépenses publiques en général. [...]  Je ne
suis pas d'accord avec les gens qui favorisent des compressions des
dépenses publiques, mais pas dans leur cour. » (Débats à la Chambre des
communes, 23 mai 1995)

La guerre contre l'Irak

« Je ne connais pas tous les faits sur l'Irak, mais je crois que nous
devrions travailler plus étroitement avec les Américains. » (Report
Newsmagazine, 25 mars 2002)

« Nous aurions dû y être, aux côtés de nos alliés. Ce qui nous inquiète,
c'est l'instabilité de notre gouvernement en tant qu'allié. Nous jouons
encore avec des questions de sécurité nationale et mondiale. » (Service
des dépêches de la Presse canadienne, 11 avril 2003)

« Parlant des justifications de la guerre, celle-ci n'était pas reliée à
la découverte de quelconques armes de destruction massive particulières.
À mon avis, c'était beaucoup plus profond. Il s'agissait d'éliminer un
régime hostile, qui avait clairement l'intention de construire des
systèmes d'armes. C'était tout simplement une situation intolérable. Si
quiconque désire revenir au bon vieux temps de Saddam Hussein, qu'il le
dise. Je crois, sincèrement, que tout le monde savait que la situation
d'après-guerre allait probablement être encore plus difficile que la
guerre elle-même. Le Canada demeure en marge de ses alliés. Il est
écarté des mécanismes de reconstruction jusqu'à un certain point. Il est
incapable d'influencer les événements. Il n'y a pas de positif dans la
position prise par le Canada. » (Maclean's, 25 août 2003)

« Le monde a désormais un seul pôle et une seule superpuissance. Le
Canada habite le même continent que cette superpuissance. Dans ce
contexte, compte tenu de la ressemblance de nos valeurs et de nos
intérêts en matière de politique, d'économie et de sécurité avec ceux
des États-Unis, la seule utilité de la politique étrangère pour le
Canada désormais est de maintenir la possibilité d'exercer une influence
réelle à Washington afin que nous puissions faire avancer les objectifs
uniques des politiques canadiennes. » (Énoncé de politiques de défense
de l'Alliance canadienne, The New North Strong and Free [le nouveau Nord
puissant et libre], 5 mai 2003, page 5)

« Mon parti ne prendra pas position en fonction des sondages d'opinion,
a-t-il déclaré au cours d'un débat parlementaire spécial sur l'Irak.
Nous n'arrêterons pas notre position en nous inspirant de groupes de
réflexion. Nous ne prendrons pas position en fonction des tribunes
téléphoniques, des sondages maison ou des caprices de l'opinion publique
[...]  À mon avis, le Canada finira bien par joindre les rangs de la
coalition alliée, si la guerre contre l'Irak est déclarée. Le
gouvernement canadien va se rallier, en dépit de son manque de
préparation, de sa coopération défaillante avec ses alliés et de son
incapacité de contribuer. En fin de compte, il y sera contraint par
l'incertitude et l'indécision. Il ne fera pas son entrée comme un
leader, mais ni vu ni connu, en bout de file. Il ne devrait pas en être
ainsi. Cela est incompatible avec l'histoire remarquable de notre pays
et notre réputation en tant que nation. Nous devons tenir bon dans
l'épreuve et savoir prendre des décisions
difficiles. Les députés alliancistes continueront d'adopter publiquement
des positions fermes et de préconiser que les préparatifs militaires
nécessaires soient faits pour que la guerre puisse être évitée. Je ne
peux que prier instamment notre gouvernement de suivre notre exemple. »
(Débats de la Chambre des communes, 29 janvier 2003)

Alors que certains Canadiens s'opposent à l'invasion, M. Harper affirme
qu'ils ne sont qu'une minorité, comme les anti-américains. « Cela
existe, assurément. Mais en toute honnêteté, il existe un sentiment
anti-américain au sein de la gauche américaine même aux États-Unis. Nous
avons ce sentiment aussi ici, mais il n'est partagé que par une
minorité. » Avec sa « tradition pacifiste », le Québec abrite la
majorité des gens qui s'opposent à la guerre. « À l'extérieur du Québec,
je crois fermement que la majorité silencieuse des Canadiens y est très
favorable. » (Halifax Daily News, 4 avril 2003)

L'appellation de conservateur

« Ce n'est vraiment pas une étiquette qui me plaît. [...] Je suis plus à
l'aise dans une tradition plus populiste. Le conservatisme se situe dans
le contexte historique de hiérarchie et d'élitisme et c'est une
philosophie politique d'un genre différent. Ce n'est pas le terme que je
préfère, mais nous devrons probablement le garder. » (Hamilton
Spectator, 24 janvier 2004)

Here are two versions of a new "Flash Polaroid" though I think this goes a
bit beyond the concept.

They star my partner's 3-legged cat, Stump, and some crazy dude I saw in the
park.

They have sound, the first is set to the Smiths' "Death of a Disco
Dancer" -- my first rock video:

http://www.arras.net/polaroids/guy_cat_pan_disco.html

The second is a sort of minimalist sludge a la Steve Reich, but this one
using a Jeff Buckley bootleg of him doing "The Boy With a Thorn in his
Side," though you can hardly tell.

http://www.arras.net/polaroids/guy_cat_pan_growing_sound.html

Both are the same basic file, but in the second the loop is faster, 16fps I
think, while in the first it's only 12 fps.  Perhaps that hardly makes a
difference, but I wanted the Disco one to be slower.

The minimalist one sounds great really loud, lots of bass.

Fast connections only!

SF gallery owner becomes target after showcasing painting of Iraqi
prisoner abuse

- LISA LEFF, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, May 29, 2004

  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2004/05/29/state1749EDT0067.DTL&type=printable

After displaying a painting of U.S. soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners,
a San Francisco gallery owner bears a painful reminder of the nations
unresolved anguish over the incidents at Abu Ghraib -- a black eye and
bloodied brow delivered by an unknown assailant who apparently objected
to the art work.

The assault outside the Capobianco gallery in the citys North Beach
district Thursday night was the worst, but only the latest in a string
of verbal and physical attacks that have directed at owner Lori Haigh
since the painting, titled "Abuse," was installed there on May 16.

Last Wednesday, concerned for the safety of her two children, ages 14
and 4, who often accompanied her to work, Haigh decided to close the
gallery indefinitely.

Painted by Berkeley artist Guy Colwell, "Abuse," the painting at the
center of the controversy, depicts three U.S. soldiers leering at a
group of naked men in hoods with wires connected to their bodies. The
one in the foreground has a blood-spattered American flag patch on his
uniform. In the background, a soldier in sunglasses guards a blindfolded
woman.

The painting was part of a larger show of Colwell's work that mostly
featured pastel-colored abstracts.

Two days after the painting went up in a front window, someone threw
eggs and dumped trash on the doorstep. Haigh said she didnt think to
connect it to the black-and-white interpretation of the events at
Baghdads notorious prison until people started leaving nasty messages
and threats on her business answering machine.

"I think you need to get your gallery out of this neighborhood before
you get hurt." one caller said.

Even after she removed the painting from the window, the criticism
continued thanks to news coverage about the gallerys troubles. The
answering machine recorded new calls from people accusing her of being a
coward for taking the picture down. Last weekend, a man walked into the
gallery, pretended to scrutinize the art work for a moment, then marched
up to Haighs desk and spat directly in her face.

"This isnt art-politics central here at all," Haigh said. "Im not here
to make a stand. I never set out to be a crusader or a political activist."

In closing the gallery, Haigh was forced to cancel an upcoming show
featuring counterculture artist Winston Smith. She covered the windows
of the gallery with old newspapers from Sept. 11, 2003 that included
stories about the war, a statement she insists was coincidental.

For Haigh, who opened Capobianco a year-and-a-half ago, having the
chance to work with prominent artists fulfilled a lifelong dream.

"I kept thinking someday I'll have enough of a reputation where I could
bring in my heroes of the art world, people like Guy Colwell
especially," she said.

The irony of the attacks hasn't been lost on Haigh. Among the
expressions of support she's received since shuttering the gallery, her
favorite is an e-mail whose writer said, "Im sure that a few and
dangerous minds dont understand that they have only mimicked the same
perversity this painting had expressed."

The abuse also has soured her on North Beach, the Italian-American
neighborhood that spawned the Beat Generation. Long considered a bastion
of free speech, it is also home to many old-time San Franciscans. Haigh
believes "it is the locals" who first took aim at her gallery since it's
on a mostly residential street and she hadn't advertised Cowells show
when the threats started.

But others in the neighborhood have gone out of their way to offer
encouragement and sympathy, among them poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, owner
of the famed City Lights bookstore. Outside the gallery on Friday,
someone had left a bouquet of flowers along with a note reading, "The
woman who ran this gallery is a brave and honorable woman....She is a
true American and a real patriot."

San Francisco police are investigating the incidents and have stepped up
patrols around the gallery while Haigh finishes closing up shop.

Colwell stopped by on Friday and refused to discuss his work or the
reaction to it, saying only, "Im sorry if this is putting pressure on Lori."

****************************************************************************
**********************
SleepingFish, a print magazine of textual art, is now seeking works for
issue 0.5. The fuzzy theme is "dreams: the sleeping reality where anything
goes". How you interpret this is up to you, but pieces that are inspired by
or conceived during those nocturnal hours when consciousness is suspended
(without explicitly stating so) stand a better chance. Flash "fictions",
prose "poems", visual "poems", art, found objects and other form- and
genre-bending works are sought. Conventional lined poetry and short stories
are not. Pieces should be able to fit on one or two pages.

For full submission guidlines, see < http://www.sleepingfish.net/submit.htm

Apropos of this story, from the chapter on Kenneth Koch in
David Lehman's _The Last Avant-Garde_:

"Koch's escape into poetry was facilitated by his English
teacher at Walnut Hills High School [in Cincinnati],
Katherine Lappa, to whom _Wishes, Lies, and Dreams_ is
dedicated. In his junior and senior years, Koch turned in
poems that seemed to him both 'sexy and sadistic' and
expected to be rapped on the knuckles; Lappa inspired him
to a lifelong love of poetry when she told him it was okay
to allow his antisocial impluses into his poetry. In his
senior year Koch read John Dos Passos's _U.S.A._ and was
taken with the stream-of-consciousness sections. The
sensuality and violence that the boy felt he had to
repress in his daily life found their way into the
stream-of-consciousness writing he set himself to do. In
one piece he wrote of the urge to 'step on a baby's head
because it is so big and round and soft like a balloon,
and would go squash under my feet.' Katherine Lappa
remained unflappable. 'That's very good,' she said.
'That's just what you should be feeling -- part of what
you're feeling. Keep doing it.'" (p. 214)

Andalusian Dawn, poems by Nick CarbÃ³

Andalusian Dawn, Nick CarbÃ³â€™s third full-length poetry collection, is a lush, sensual collection of lyrics on interior and exterior landscapes. Many of the poems are drawn from the geographic and cultural backdrop of Spain, where the poet spent time on a writing residency; others are drawn from the more elusive well of history, biography, and literature itself. Andualusian Dawn is at once Nick CarbÃ³â€™s most ambitious collection and his most intimate, and establishes him as a major figure of his generation.

      Praise for Andalusian Dawn
â€œIn Andalusian Dawn, Nick CarbÃ³ creates a new, sweet language. This collection hums with tenderness, revelry, and pays special tribute to the importance of memory. CarbÃ³ shows his extraordinary range with this, his newest collection, that will make you want to visit Andalusia and reimagine the geography of your heartâ€™s home.â€â€”Crystal Williams

â€œThe spirits of Lorca, the gypsies who inspired him, and the great poets of al-Andalus, preside over Nick CarbÃ³â€™s Andalusian Dawn. These poems are filled with a voluble silence in which we hear the â€˜cricket-sound darkâ€™ and see â€˜millions of fireflies/ burning in rows and rows between us.â€™ CarbÃ³â€™s poems, like those of his predecessors, are conflagrations made of music and image.â€â€”Michael Collier

About the Author
Nick CarbÃ³ is the author of El Grupo McDonaldâ€™s (1995) and Secret Asian Man (2000), which won the Asian American Literary Award. He has edited two anthologies of Philippine literature: Returning a Borrowed Tongue (1996) and Babaylan (2000). He also edited an anthology, Sweet Jesus (2002), with Denise Duhamel.

How much, if any, of the anti-social in our poetry
should we allow others to see? Should it all be edited
out?

There was a bit of a flap over Sondheim's Jennifer
poems a few years back, wasn't there?

Adolescent musing on baby-head-popping is one thing,
writing through our own misogynist, racist, xenophobic
tendencies quite another.

Apropos of this story, from the chapter on Kenneth
Koch in
David Lehman's _The Last Avant-Garde_:


"Koch's escape into poetry was facilitated by his
English
teacher at Walnut Hills High School [in Cincinnati],
Katherine Lappa, to whom _Wishes, Lies, and Dreams_ is
dedicated. In his junior and senior years, Koch turned
in
poems that seemed to him both 'sexy and sadistic' and
expected to be rapped on the knuckles; Lappa inspired
him
to a lifelong love of poetry when she told him it was
okay
to allow his antisocial impluses into his poetry. In
his
senior year Koch read John Dos Passos's _U.S.A._ and
was
taken with the stream-of-consciousness sections. The
sensuality and violence that the boy felt he had to
repress in his daily life found their way into the
stream-of-consciousness writing he set himself to do.
In
one piece he wrote of the urge to 'step on a baby's
head
because it is so big and round and soft like a
balloon,
and would go squash under my feet.' Katherine Lappa
remained unflappable. 'That's very good,' she said.
'That's just what you should be feeling -- part of
what
you're feeling. Keep doing it.'" (p. 214)

Kanesatake is Quebec's own Iraq sur Le Lac
by The Gazette .
<http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/?author=The+Gazette&comments=yes>
Sunday May 30, 2004 at 07:22 PM

    The situation in Kanesatake is no laughing matter.

Kanesatake is Quebec's own Iraq sur Le Lac

Don Macpherson
The Gazette
Saturday, May 29, 2004

The situation in Kanesatake is no laughing matter. Still, it took steely
discipline for the members of the Parti Quebecois official opposition in
the National Assembly yesterday morning not to burst into incredulous
laughter at the assurance by Public Security Minister Jacques Chagnon
that everything is under control in that Mohawk community.

As Chagnon spoke, three police cars and a truck belonging to the Mohawk
Peacekeepers sat smouldering in the parking lot of the Kanesatake police
station, where they had been set on fire during the night.

But there is law and order in Kanesatake, the minister said. The proof
is that it was a patrolling Surete du Quebec officer who noticed the
vehicles were on fire.

Think about all this for a minute:

The police are unable to protect their own vehicles parked at their own
station, let alone the public - especially now that they're on foot.

The grand chief, an avowed foe of drug dealers, hasn't dared set foot
there since his house was burned to the ground four months ago, an act
for which no arrests have been made.

Local residents say parents are afraid to send their children to school,
and property owners have trouble getting insurance.

And Chagnon himself has been on the defensive all week for portraying
Kanesatake as a place where you need to hit the ground at the caw of a
crow because the trigger-happy locals respond to such annoyances by
reaching for their ever-handy 12-gauge shotguns.

In the most surreal development of the week, Gabriel responded to
Chagnon by hotly defending the reputation of his community - from exile
in Laval, since it is not safe for him to enter Kanesatake.

This is the minister's idea of law and order?

Violence, lawlessness, factionalism, powerless local officials with
little visible local support - why, we have something like our own
little Iraq on the shores of the Lake of Two Mountains, a half-hour
drive from Montreal.

And in Quebec City, we have our own Bushies, assuring us that everything
is going according to plan.

In their case, the plan, as outlined yesterday by Benoit Pelletier,
consists mainly of investing the government's hopes in Gabriel, whom it
has tried to rehabilitate after Chagnon undermined his authority by
criticizing his handling of the policing problem. The government hopes
for elections in July in which Gabriel will be re-elected and the
faction loyal to him will take control of the band council.

This is a rather flimsy basket in which to place the government's eggs.
If an election could solve Kanesatake's problem, there would be no
problem in the first place, since Gabriel is already, as the media
emphasize, the duly elected grand chief.

For democracy to work, everybody has to accept to be bound by the rules,
and by the results of an election (or a referendum). That is, everybody
has to be a good loser.

But in Kanesatake, people don't even agree on who should be allowed to
vote - only residents, or nonresident band members as well. Some Mohawks
refuse to recognize the legitimacy of decisions made under the white
man's rules, which helps explain why usually only a minority of eligible
voters bother to turn out. And others are sore losers who either
challenge in the courts or simply ignore decisions that don't go their way.

Besides, as PQ leader Bernard Landry pointed out yesterday, it would
hardly be a fair election if Gabriel was unable to campaign among his
constituents.

Pelletier pointed out at least the government has avoided bloodshed. And
he said if anybody has any better ideas, the government is willing to
listen. But the only other idea anyone seems to have is to demand
Chagnon's resignation.

Premier Jean Charest has defended Chagnon, but only when forced to do
so, and he may keep Chagnon in his present portfolio only until the
cabinet shuffle everybody around the Assembly expects after the spring
sitting.

It's true Chagnon has got into more than his share of political trouble
over Kanesatake. But nobody has explained how changing the minister
would solve the problem in our little Iraq by the lake.

Police Brutality Activist Dies in Police Custody


     Outraged community residents threw down the gauntlet against
business as usual in Thursday's police board meeting, leaving their
seats to surround board members and command level police brass and
demand meaningful steps in the investigation of the death in police

Police Brutality Activist Dies in Police Custody


Outraged community residents threw down the gauntlet against business as
usual in Thursday's police board meeting, leaving their seats to
surround board members and command level police brass and demand
meaningful steps in the investigation of the death in police custody of
May Molina. Police say they found Molina dead or near death in a police
cell at Belmont and Western Wednesday morning. Her supporters have
accused police of being responsible for her death.


Outraged community residents threw down the gauntlet against business as
usual in Thursday's police board meeting, leaving their seats to
surround board members and command level police brass and demand
meaningful steps in the investigation of the death in police custody of
May Molina. Police say they found Molina dead or near death in a police
cell at Belmont and Western Wednesday morning. Her supporters have
accused police of being responsible for her death.

The protesters' action at Thursday's police board meeting prompted
police officials to offer the protesters an unprecedented Friday morning
meeting with the head of the Chicago Police Department's Office of
Professional Standards. The meeting is scheduled for 9AM on Friday, May
28 with Lori Lightfoot, chief administrator of the Office of
Professional Standards, at her 12th floor office, at 10 W. 35th St., at
35th and State Street. Molina's supporters are urging members of the
public to attend the meeting.

More than 150 of Molina's friends, supporters and family members
attended the Thursday police board meeting, including her two small
grandchildren and two of her nieces.

Her nieces, both of whom are studying to be lawyers, said the death of
their aunt in police custody early Wednesday morning had seriously
shaken their faith in the criminal justice system. "If you knew my aunt,
you know these things [the police are] saying don't make sense," said
her niece Maritza Perez. Many speakers at the police board meeting
demanded an independent investigation and autopsy in the case, charging
that it was impossible to trust the police to conduct an honest
investigation.

Molina was arrested Monday night at her home near Addison and Halsted on
allegations of heroin possession, a charge those who know her find
highly suspicious. She was taken to the notorious Town Hall police
district, and later transferred to area headquarters at Belmont and
Western. Family members went repeatedly to both stations to plead with
police to allow her to take her medicine. The wheelchair bound
55-year-old activist had a range of health problems, including diabetes.
Her attorney, Jerry Bischoff, visited her Tuesday afternoon in jail and
said he told police she was very ill, needed her medication and needed
to be taken to the hospital. Police deny that Molina, her relatives or
her attorney asked that she be allowed to take her medication or be
taken to a hospital.

Wednesday night, the County coroner's office leaked a report to police
that Molina had been found to have six packs of heroin in her esophagus.
Family and supporters scoffed at that allegation, wondering if it was
plausible to believe that Molina had not swallowed over the course of
more than 28 hours in police custody, leaving the heroin lodged in her
throat.

"We want answers," Rev. Walter Coleman told police board members
Thursday night. "This woman was deeply loved and respected in the
community. It is unprofessional - it is wrong -- for the police or the
coroner to leak unsubstantiated information and engage in a smear
campaign against this woman when we already know there has been serious
police wrongdoing in this case. The police have no credibility in the
community."

"My mother died twenty years ago, and May Molina was the only mother
I've ever known," said Maribel Shattini. "We demand an independent
investigation into her death, because frankly, we don't trust the police."

Molina was widely respected for her work on behalf of the wrongfully
convicted, including her son Salvatore Ortiz, who she and supporters
charge was wrongfully convicted of a homicide by west side cops and the
Cook County State's Attorney's Office. Ortiz has served ten years of a
47 year sentence, and the family was hopeful that recent legal progress
in the case might push forward efforts to win his freedom. She had
opened an office on the west side recently along with other police
accountability activists as part of a broad campaign to step up the
campaign to draw public attention to police misconduct and wrongful
convictions.

After people in the meeting engulfed board members and top brass,
chanting "the people, united, will never be defeated," police officials
hastily offered to set up a meeting with the Office of Professional
Standards Friday morning. The crowd surrounded board members and police
brass as former death row inmate Aaron Patterson rose to speak, saying
part of the problem was the lack of closeness between board members and
the public. "These meetings are too informal," said Patterson, who then
asked Molina's supporters to join him in moving closer to the board
members and top police brass, who were seated at a long table at the
head of the room. Molina's advocates and relatives rose to their feet
and joined Patterson in surrounding the board members, police
superintendent Phil Cline and police department corporation counsel
Sheri Mecklenburg.

Police staff stood between the protesters and police officials, and
several minutes later police spokesperson Pat Camden stepped forward
with the offer to schedule a meeting between Molina's advocates and the
OPS chief Friday morning.

Molina's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday at 2PM.

Joel: If you plug in "Iraqi women rape" into any search engine, I think it's
possible to get further beyond your sense of hearsay as to what constitutes
rape & circumstance for women in Iraq.
*
I did - as I suspect many - listened/saw some of the events around the
opening of the new WWII Memorial. I found many of testimonials to be very
moving. Four of my uncles were in the South Pacific during WWII - one of
whom died of conflict related disease -  and another one fought in Europe &
North Africa. In the forties, when I was very young, none of the uncles
never spoke in any detail about their experiences - I don't if that was a
taboo - in that young kids should not be exposed to the down & dirty details
of battle. I sensed it was something larger, a forbidden area - self-imposed
or otherwise.
So I found it quite moving to hear people - men who resembled my uncles -
finally talk about the details of what they did and suffered, stories of
captivity, escape and all. A silence broken, a much wanted healing. I sensed
many others in the audiences on camera opened themselves similarly.

As to whether this experience will cross boundaries - former enemy to enemy
- I know it happens on a personal & group level. Vietnam Vets going back to
Vietnam, for example. As to taking place on a cross-national Government
level, I am not holding my breath - MacMcmara (SP?) as a US Principal in the
War, for example, returning in a formal US capacity to lay flowers on the
graves of Viet Cong soldiers - as much as such may promise in the way of a
larger healing.

>>>> prisoners across Iraq "within 45 days". Some 2,000 are likely to remain
>>>> behind bars, he says. Iraqi lawyers and officials aredemanding that the
> US
>>>> military hands the prisons over to Iraqi management on June 30, when
> the
>>>> coalition transfers limited powers to a UN-appointed caretaker Iraqi

>>>>
>>>> Relatives who gathered outside Abu Ghraib last Friday said it was

WHAT IS MATMOS?

Matmos is M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel, aided and
abetted by many others. In their recordings and live
performances over the last nine years, Matmos have
used the sounds of: amplified crayfish nerve tissue,
the pages of bibles turning, a bowed five string
banjo, slowed down whistles and kisses, water hitting
copper plates, the runout groove of a vinyl record, a
$5.00 electric guitar, liposuction surgery, cameras
and VCRs, chin implant surgery, contact microphones on
human hair, violins, rat cages, tanks of helium,
violas, human skulls, cellos, peck horns, tubas, cards
shuffling, field recordings of conversations in hot
tubs, frequency response tests for defective hearing
aids, a steel guitar recorded in a sewer, electrical
interference generated by laser eye surgery, whoopee
cushions and balloons, latex fetish clothing,
rhinestones on a dinner plate, Polish trains, insects,
ukelele, aspirin tablets hitting a drum kit from
across the room, dogs barking, people reading aloud,
life support systems and inflatable blankets, records
chosen by the roll of dice, an acupuncture point
detector conducting electrical current through human
skin, rock salt crunching underfoot, solid gold coins
spinning on bars of solid silver, the sound of a
frozen stream thawing in the sun, a five gallon bucket
of oatmeal.



NEW MATMOS EP! RELEASE THE RATS!

While some of you astute web searchers have already
cottoned on, we are duty bound to report to you that
Locust Records is about to plague the earth with a new
Matmos EP. Entitled "Rat Relocation Program", it's our
contribution to their ongoing MET LIFE series, which
is always a two track affair, the first an unedited
urban field recording, the second a musical response
to that recording. Our liner notes tell the tale: "A
street rat was breaking into our apartment, eating our
food and chewing holes in our clothes. Since we
already had a pet rat, the prospect of trying to kill
one rat while feeding another struck us as intolerable
hypocrisy, so we bought a non-lethal "Have-a-Heart
Trap". After several days of luring the invader closer
and closer towards and then inside the trap with
peanuts, we captured her. The first track is an
unedited recording of the rat protestingits
incarceration. The second track is our response, in
which the timing and duration of the rat screams from
the first track have been preserved. The following
morning we took the rat to a wealthy suburban
neighborhood and set it free." Think of it as our
contribution to the "talking animals" genre ("The
Incredible Journey", "The Rats of N.I.M.H.","Watership
Down", etc.). Fiction minded folks might consider
curling up with a copy of H. P. Lovecraft's "The Rats
in the Walls" or Sigmund Freud's case history of "The
Rat Man" and plugging in for a long dark night. Or
not.

WHAT IS MATMOS DOING?

The band is touring Europe.

When we're not doing all of that, we are earning our
crust by co-teaching a class called "Theory and
Practice" in the New Genres Department of the San
Francisco Art Institute. Martin teaches Technical
Tuesdays and Drew teaches Theoretical Thursdays.
Martin teaches people about electricity, about how to
make and edit sound recordings, about how to shoot and
edit video footage, and about the history of musique
concrete, structuralist film, and video art. Drew has
cooked up an eclectic introduction to "theory" (oh
god) that takes in formal and symbolic logic,
conceptual art, structural linguistics, the poetics of
Oulipo, psychoanalysis, Aktionism, "heterology", and
gender studies. Those of you who wish to enroll in our

Astride, somewhat in between but behind; love like
gnarled volume null in periodic drills of sprung rain.

I have lisps you installed like a song made of
breaths, this wide.

How tall are you, she says. She's dead. I need to
waste candles around where she lies.

Did you ever cup the light there, when standing up in
the dark is so kill you waver?

Star just done trickling off your tongue.

PUB: call for proposals--arab american literature
=======================================

Call for Proposals
Arab American Literature
Fall 2006 issue of MELUS Journal (Multi-Ethnic Literatures of the U.S.)

Since September 11th teachers and scholars of American literatures have
been trying to find ways to incorporate literature written by Arab
Americans into literature courses. Despite the evolving canon of American
literature over the past few decades, Arab American writers like Ameen
Rihani or Kahlil Gibran have been overlooked though more contemporary Arab
American writers like Nathalie Handal or Diana Abu Jaber may be granted a
token slot in a literature course. While it is important to include these
and other writers into the American literary canon, this act in isolation
does not allow students or researchers to glean the full complexity of the
historical and political circumstances that brought people from the Arab
world to North America beginning in the early twentieth century.

This issue of MELUS seeks to engage with Arab American literature through
a range of historical and political issues that have conditioned Arab
American intellectual and cultural work in the United States. Articles
should engage with representational issues of Arabs in the United States
and the contestation around Arab self-representation as well. Articles may
focus on the organizational politics of Arabs in the U.S. and their
efforts to build community-based initiatives that are social and
political. Essay may also focus on the history of Arab language
publications in the United States. The articles we seek for this special
issue may address 9/11 as it looks back upon that event, but we would also
like to see articles that attempt to assess the impact of 9/11.

For this special issue of MELUS journal, we invite articles that engage
with literature and culture, but from an interdisciplinary and theoretical
perspective. Essays should be 4000-6000 words in length (including notes
and works cited), clearly written, theoretically informed, and relevant to
the socio-political context from which the work emerged.

Please email a 500 word proposal as a Microsoft Word attachment along with
a brief curriculum vitae with complete contact information by September
30, 2004 to both:

Professor Marcy Newman, Boise State University, mnewman@boisestate.edu

and

Professor Salah Hassan, Michigan State University, hassans3@msu.edu

Note: Completed essays are due (postmarked by) January 15, 2005. No
previously published or simultaneous submissions, please. >>

I have been testing out Koch's books-- Wishes Lies and Dreams, Rose Where
Did You Get That Red, Sleeping on the Wing-- while teaching poetry to
3rd-8th graders in public schools on Buffalo's East Side (through Just
Buffalo Literary Center's writers' residencies program).  My students are
95% African-American and most of them are extremely poor: forget assigning
homework, or expecting the kids to come to class with pencil and paper.
Many of these kids have first-hand experience of physical violence, from
verbal abuse and beating to homicide.  (When I ask them to write about the
sounds of the neighborhood, for example, gunshots are a regular feature.)
It has become increasingly apparent to me that: a) Koch was working with a
vastly different demographic (and, of course, time) and/or b) the selections
of student work that make up the bulk of his teaching anthologies-- largely
all "sweetness and light"-- has been quietly edited of any "disturbing"
content.  (I don't mean to imply that class and race, or even epoch,
determine the content and tone of children's writing-- why I suspect a
certain amount of editorial censorship on Koch's part, either in the
classroom or in assembling his anthologies.)  You'd be amazed what 3rd-grade
kids will write when given permission.

Many of the kids I work with are developmentally disabled (so-called "crack
babies") and keeping these classes in order, i.e. above the threshold of
total chaos, involves (on the part of the long-term teacher) a detailed, and
consistently applied, disciplinary regimen.  At the same time, teachers who
invite me into their classes to do poetry are obviously open to experiment
and risk, and usually-- amazingly-- give me free reign.  But they also will
not hesitate to ask me to remove or silently suppress extremely offensive
lines when I read or present student work back to the class (meanness,
insults, misogynistic fantasy).  Teachers rarely take a purely suppressive
approach to such instances, however; instead, shocking material is engaged
as a therapeutic moment and usually involves some discussion of the content
with the student.  If at all possible, I will take advantage of my "visiting
artist" immunity to raise the issue of violent imagery with the class as a
whole (without singling out the author): such "discussion" rarely works
below the 7th grade level, however (where even the word "funk"-- in a poem
by Amiri Baraka-- can send the kids into a five-minute spiral of raucous
hilarity).  Needless to say, these kids can be extremely imaginative, and
endlessly inspiring.  But as any teacher in the schools knows, it's often
the most "troubled" or "bad" kids who do the best writing-- so that the
greatest poetry often comes in a mixed bag, along with the most "offensive"
or "disturbing" things.

I was interested to hear of Koch's "sexy and sadistic" high school poems.
Although the value of his contribution to poetry in the schools cannot be
underestimated, I have been disappointed to find no discussion, in any of
his pedagogical works, of the more "difficult" moments a teacher of poetry
in the public schools is likely to encounter.  Everything's just "fun,"
"joyous," "terrific," "exciting," "wonderful."  (Note how "sexy" keeps the
bright side up, in Koch's libidinal moment-- putting an innocent, and "fun,"
spin on what might otherwise, from another angle, be considered "sexist."
Would he speak as openly about his "sexist and sadistic" poems?)  In fact,
the almost universal absence, in Koch's pedagogy, of any acknowledgement/
discussion of class, racial, sexual tensions in the classroom seems odd, to
say the least.

Sleeping on the Wing-- put together with Kate Farrell-- does take a step in
this direction, with inclusion of poems by (sic) "Leroi Jones" (including
"Cold Term" and "A Poem for Black Hearts," with the lines, "For Great Malcom
a prince of the earth, let nothing in us rest/ until we avenge ourselves for
his death, stupid animals/ that killed him, let us never breathe a pure
breath if/ we fail and white men call us faggots till the end of the
earth.")  Koch's ensuing commentary, directed to the student writer, is that
"To be a political poet, a poet with a cause, is in one way wonderful and
inspiring.  You have a theme you believe in, strong feelings, a reason to
write.  In another way it is difficult if you want to be a good poet.
Attitudes, convictions, beliefs, however right they are, do not necessarily
make good poetry."  Further on, Koch notes that Jones's (Baraka's) "cause,
his theme, is obviously his main inspiration.  But the poem isn't limited to
that: he looks at different things; he feels different things; he is filled
with longing, anger, excitement, sadness, doubt, love."  Interpret Koch's
commentary as you will.  Obviously, Baraka's "Poem for Black Hearts," with
its call for vengeance, would not be "safe" (or even "legal") poetry, in the
current climate.  But it is not even clear whether Koch considers it "good"
poetry.

I am not interested in evaluating Koch-- though I would like to know of any
pedagogical texts of his that do dig beneath the surface here-- so much as
wondering how current teachers of poetry in the schools update the obviously
limited (if useful to a point) expressivist pedagogy that launched the
poetry-in-the-schools movement?  "Giving permission" is, of course, a
crucial first step, but there's a lot more to teaching poetry to young
people, especially to young people in troubled circumstances.  From another
angle, it strikes me that the failure of "langpo"-related writing to
articulate a poetry-in-the-schools pedagogy (beyond continually rehashing
Bernadette Mayer's Writing Experiments) is a MAJOR weakness.  Are there any
post-expressivist teaching anthologies and/or pedagogical texts out there?
I can think of books by Bernadette Mayer (Science Writing) and Jack Collom,
but who else . . . ?  Obviously, many "langpo"-related writers do teach
poetry in the schools, so there must be a huge pool of experience to draw on
for such an anthology.  Or is there?

Except in the hands of the most talented teachers, I am sure that most
hardcore "language" or "experimental" writing falls flat on its face in the
3rd-12th grade classroom.  (Hejinian's My Life, and a few other cases, are
the notable exceptions that, perhaps, prove the point.)  But I would love to
hear from teachers who have had success teaching this kind of writing
(Bernstein, Andrews, Silliman, Weiners, Davies, Howe, Watten, Harryman,
Mullen, etc.) to children and adolescents-- which poems, how they were
taught and what the students produced in response.  I myself have found that
procedural/ collaborative writing is the best way through and around the
dangerous shoals of the unconscious-in-the-classroom.  And obviously, the
contributions of "language" writing in this area are huge.  But I usually
find myself going back to the surrealists for examples to use with the kids,
or to post-"langpo" writers of my own generation (like Julie Patton or Bill
Luoma, amongst many others).

In a way, what's disturbing about the case of George T. (the "criminal" San
Jose poet) is not the suppression of "free speech," so much as the
fundamental misunderstanding the case evinces, on both sides, about the
nature of poetry-- "a classic case of a person expressing himself and trying
to communicate his feelings" (according to the defendant's lawyer).  Or cf.
the prosecution's equation of a work of art with a bank robber's note that
happens to rhyme: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Give me the money or
I'll shoot you."  (Ironically, such efficacy-- in addition to the jarringly
"modern" appropriation, displacement and juxtaposition of these lines, their
element of "surprise"-- may be what many a "revolutionary of the word" has
secretly hoped for poetry!)

But here there is no discussion of how the motivation for art can be
different from the communicative motivations of utilitarian language or how,
as performatives, poems differ from love notes or threats.  To talk about
how "feelings" are different from "intent" is an important step.  But it
still leaves poetry-as-such out of the conversation.

We can probably lay some of the blame for this on how poetry gets taught in
the schools.  We certainly have Koch, amongst others, to thank for the fact
that poetry writing gets taught at all.  But one suspects (hopes) that the
range of pedagogical resources for such teaching has expanded, and gained in
sophistication, in the thirty plus years since Koch first taught 3rd graders
the (poetic) virtues of wishing, lying and dreaming?

Thanks, Jonathan, for this real good and interesting critical take on being
"in residence" as a poet in such a challenging school.
In terms of books - and it's been awhile since I've been active in a school
- but my sense is that Teachers & Writers Collective's publishing arm is
probably one of the best resources in terms of books that address teaching
in bi-linguage and multi-ethnic circumstances - I would give them a call or
look up their web site.

 Teachers and Writers - before it became an independent organization - was
started by Herb Kohl in 1965 at Columbia. Herb's almost best seller was a
book called "36 Children" about his experience of teaching elementary school
in Harlem.  T&W - from the start - was, and I would hope remains - inclusive
in terms of its participating poets (which in those days included Victor
Hernandez Cruz and David Henderson).

Then came Kenneth Koch's first book on his teaching experiences with - a big
success as well, but definitely much more non-inner City affair. On one hand
poets have that book to thank for the NEA supporting poetry-in-the-schools
projects across the country. (I was one of the first California Coordinators
for the program in the early Seventies through the Poetry Center at SF
State).

As wonderful as the Koch book was, in a way its biggest problem in the City
was that it was so, for lack of a better term, "white", and definitely
Mandarin in its literary persuasion. (My impression was the Herb and Koch
did not exactly cotton to each other)  Definitely was without "funk", or
much that engaged with kids who were being strongly shaped by other
influences.
I, frankly, recently on this list, without initially responding, was
bothered by Koch's conviction that the poet should introduce difficult and
challenging poems - of which the subtext I interpreted - fairly or not - was
not to take poems that were responsive to or of the social/cultural context
of the students. (Or that the local was without such sophistication)  At its
worst that the pedagogical intention/message there is that one should teach
by imperial example. Which is an old story. Similar to the Brits teaching
Wordsworth's "daffodils" in tropical Africa where such flower had never seen
the light of day. Not that the locals might not want to have curiosity about
about daffodils - and in these days, a rich institution could Google up the
image - the problem is that the expat teachers never took that much
interest, or deigned to think there was a local literature - though it may
not come in the medium of a book.

I remember too well of going to West Africa at 23 thinking that I would
bring WCW to my University creative writing students - assuming that the
students would love the work, drop the inculcation of Yeats, Pound etc and
-like me - take to WCW as the way to perceive and interpret their world. It
took me about a year to shut up and listen to 'the there of the there'. I
mean African cultures have been around for a few thousand years - robust in
literatures, arts and various critical aesthetics of what constitutes the
"well made" - in short - it was all quite humbling. I realized I would have
to be there for years to know where I was and I am sure I ended up by being
given much more than I gave. Even got some friends and students into WCW!

I think what's interesting - given your circumstance - is the chemistry of
the works you bring as an outsider and what the worlds students bring as
"insiders" - it's that concoction that generates work that can be genuinely
liberating & surprising - for teacher and student - rather than emulative.

Of course, none of this is easy.
