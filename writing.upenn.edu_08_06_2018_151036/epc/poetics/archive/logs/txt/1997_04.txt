Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  If you are in San Francisco on Friday, I
hope you will come to my new play, which I wrote with a good friend, the
painter Scott Hewicker.

In 1949 a small band of would-be actresses and atom scientists (Farrah
=46awcett, Elizabeth Taylor, Ursula Andress and Goldie Hawn), together with
famed attorney Arlene Schwimmer, the =B3pit bull of Hollywood,=B2 gather at
Princeton=B9s Center for Advanced Studies to develop the Schwimmer Effect.
It=B9s a device to keep you and your loved ones young forever and it=B9s
marketed as fragrances, Black Diamonds and White Pearls.

By 1997 the Schwimmer Effect has taken hold of all of Hollywood and indeed
the world, except for one tiny corner of mountain fastness in Tibet, where
Jack (Dr. Death) Kevorkian, the Dalai Lama (a reformed Ursula Andress) and
her ward, Vicki Steubing, join forces to combat an unnatural system of
life, death and eternal hype. They watch in horror as the cast of the top
NBC sitcom =B3Friends=B2 are killed one by one as soon as they turn thirty.
Half melodrama, half sci-fi spectacular, and half witch hunt, =B3The
Schwimmer Effect=B2 boasts a cast of topflight actors and the thrills and
chills of the =B3Star Wars=B2 adventures! With:

Norma Cole, Margaret Crane, Mark Ewert, Kota Ezawa, Phoebe Gloeckner, Craig
Goodman,  Clifford Hengst, Kevin Killian, Karla Milosevich, Richard Prouty,
Rex Ray, Michelle Rollman and Wayne Smith and Alicia Wing.


Presented by Small Press Traffic
New College Theater
777 Valencia Street
7:30 p.m.
$5-$10 sliding scale
Limited seating.  Please call for reservations:  415/437-3454.

Okay, see you everyone!

As much as I intend not to haunt this list, I must inform you
of this on Doug Rice's behalf: Rice's _Blood of Mugwump_ is far less
gender-specific than you might think. The lines between male and female
are blurred precisely because the author is ambivalent as to h/e/i/r/s
own gender within the gender narrative. And if my statement itself
sounds ambivalent, then I must tactfully refer you to Chi Chi Valenti's
inspired site, Jackie 60 (click-and-drag):

http://www.echonyc.com/~interjackie/.

Thus, the question of a "man writing abt woman's sexuality" is
rather more complex than it might appear--which ties in splicely
with author/mugwump Doug Rice's Faulknerian identity questions.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Thanks for the clarification. Btw, we would want to call Celan a 'citizen',
wouldnt we? A suffering one, to boot. And the concept of being one, &
having one's citizenship stripped from one are hovering over a lot of the
poems, I think?

How does one 'write' one's 'citizenship' into one's poems? Not just one
way, I'm pretty sure... On the other hand, if 'Maximus' wasnt a 'citizen,'
who was?

As a Canadian I can sympathize with Kent Johnson's worries, but I dont have
a representative to write to. I cheer from the sidelines on this one. On
the other hand, it is possible, isnt it?, that the writers herein are
continuing to talk about those seductive gaps here & writing letters or
e-notes to their congresspeople offline? Why not? I send my letters to MPs
separately from any list...

Last call to submit an abstract or proposal to participate in the forum on
deixis.


                     CALL FOR ABSTRACTS/PROPOSALS

        STUDIES IN DEIXIS: WORKING THE MARGINS OF PRAGMATICS AND SEMANTICS

             for the Midwest Modern Language Association Meeting,
             Chicago, November 6-8, 1997, Ramada Congress Hotel

Abstracts are being accepted for "Studies in Deixis: Working the
Margins of Pragmatics and Semantics." The multidimensionality of
deixis, a linguistic phenomenon at the heart of communication,
remains one of the most intriguing aspects of human language. It is
impossible to imagine communication that functions without deixis.
Deictic elements such as pronouns, demonstrative adjectives, and
spatial or temporal adverbs, express a user-centered perspective on
time, place and person relationships in the social context of an
utterance; simultaneously, they denote formal grammatical functions
within an utterance. The aim of the forum is to bring together
scholars working on different aspects of deixis--from formal
linguistics to stylistics--to discuss the activity that occurs at
the intersection of language and reality/structure and function.
Publication of the proceedings is planned.

Abstracts/proposals should be a maximum of 150 words in length and
must be received by Friday, April 4, 1997.

If I remember right, their name was chosen to vibrate with "Generation Gap" -

How this all might relate to inarticulated silences in the poem I'm left
somewhat agape.

Folks:

Received this from a good friend and poet known to many of you (who,
sorry, wishes to remain nameless here), and thought I'd send along
since it provides context to the FC2 matter. Still playing phone-tag
with Curt White at FC2, but will post anything I can get.

OK., I'll admit and apologize for my rash annoyance--the discussion on
white space is interesting and
learned, and I've learned from much of it. But let's see what we can
do too to give a hand to these folks at FC2, ok?

Franklin Bruno wrote about white caesurae: "What if the poem's printed

bpNichol's that has a "white caesura" in it but was printed on lilac
paper.  Great, I say to both: colored caesurae!  Not just white but pink
and violet caesurae, and yeller and scarlet!

I still think, though, that all such colored caesurae, in essence, are
white, whatever concealing color they are overpainted with.  But I
suspect that further reflection is called for.

Hi Kevin -

I looked in our Langston Hughes file when I read your post, but was
surprised not to find any mention of trouble when he read for the Center in
1958. (There are documents in other files about troubled readings. There
was apparently some official worry about a reading of ("cult leader") Allen
Ginsberg that is documented in his file.) Hughes was invited to read by
Ruth Witt-Diamant, as you mention, who also arranged several other West
Coast readings for him. It is interesting that S.I. Hiyakawa is mentioned
as arranging an event for Hughes in relation to jazz. The tape of his
reading says that Hughes read at the SF Art Museum, which was a usual venue
for the Center at that time.

Our file consists of xeroxes. I have no way of knowing if it is complete.
You are welcome to look through it.

Best-
Laura

Aesthetics is politics. Maybe white caesurae can blank out white tornados.

Agreed!  And since we're investigating the unnamed--what about an
indelicate sensation that haunts the species at century's end?  I mean

Hey Rachel, back when we were playing the neologism game i coined
"flawdacity"--for the fool's courage to post anyway, even when it's
probably going to seem dumb later (tho in my example it was 2am, not
lunchtime).  How about "post-departum repression" for the desire to take
it back right after you've plunked the "send" command?  Oops, i think
i'm getting ready to have it right now...

possibility of dancing to it or doing your homework to it. I am speaking of
all manner of utilitarian purposes for poetry. To get it via ear when the
poet isn't here.

Besides the entire Mouth Almighty Catalogue ("The United States of Poetry,"
"fLIPPIN THE sCRIPT:Rap Meets Poetry," Michele Serros's "Stories from Chicano
Falsa," Wammo's "Fat-Headed Stranger," "Grand Slam! Best of the National
Poetry Slam," Ginsberg's "Ballad of the Skeletons," and the newly released,
exquisite!, Sekou Sundiata's "Blue Oneness of Dreams") I would draw your
attention to the extraordinary "The Past Didn't Go Anywhere" by Utah Philips
and Ani DiFranco on the Righteous Babe label and the required but mixed-bag
 "A Century of Recorded Poetry" on Rhino, which is worth it for the Rukeyser
and Stein alone, and there's oodles more....

as examples.

So, I guess what I'm saying, is that IN the label, I  serve the vision (heh
heh -- I mean the aural vision. I guess; I mean.) of the poet herself.

That said (heh heh), I'll call Brenda and have a cup of virtual coffee. You
got her email?

And by the by, I wonder if anyone has any of the aforementioned CD's, and if
there's any critiques about.

How often do you listen do poetry CDs?

How many times do you listen to a single one?

Thanks, List! and Bil

A car--Ford decided on Edsel (not Moore's choice).  Ford didn't use her
suggestions, none of which I can remember right now, though one was
something like turtletop flyer (might have worked as well as Edsel).

I do my homework to recordings of Ted Berrigan and Bernadette Mayer. I've
listened to the cd packaged with the Exact Change Yearbook No. 1 many
times. The Kerouac boxed set is tremendous, and not bad either is the
_Howls Raps Roars_ set, especially the Allen Ginsberg and the Lenny Bruce.

Call me a purist, though, I like the unaccompanied Kerouac readings (what a
self that guy put forward!) a lot better than the cute Zoot Sims or the
noodly Steve Allen stuff.  Which is not to say you can't put forward a
great self with some music in the background, but it's tough ...

Getting going,

I have to share Don DeLillo's bit on car names, from White Noise, for
those who haven't read it.  The scene is the school gym, during an
"airborn toxic event" (so it goes), the protagonist (chair of Hitler
studies at the College on the Hill) is watching his daughter sleep, and
she utters "Toyota Celica":

"A long moment passed before I realized this was the name of an
automobile.  The truth only amazed me more.  The utterance was beautiful
and mysterious, gold-shot with looming wonder.  It was like the name of an
ancient power in the sky, tablet-carved in cuneiform.  It made me feel
that something hovered.  But how could this be?  A simple brand name, an
ordinary car.  How could these near-nonsense words, mumured in a child's
restless sleep, make me sense a meaning, a presence?  She was only
repeating some TV voice.  Toyota Corolla, Toyota Celica, Toyota Cressida.
Supranational names, computer-generated, more or less universally
pronounceable.  Part of every child's brain noise, the substatic regions
too deep to probe.  Whatever its source, the utterance struck me with the
impact of a moment of splendid transcendence.
        I depend on my children for that."

 That would have been better than Edsel.  It would have been a better
name not just for the car but for the guy the car was named after (with
aplogies to anyone on the list named Edsel).  He could have moved to an
old Wisconsin dairy-town and nobody would have noticed.

Our story begins at New College on March 14th, when Ed Foster and Giovanni
Singleton read to a near-capacity crowd.  Dodie Bellamy first introduced
Ed, who read from such works as "Four Last Songs For Schubert" and "Wheel
of Fortune", dropping such gems as:

anger is my treason
irony was your defence as if it was not solitude
the angel rises from the page
we don't need coffee, we don't need you
your hand becomes a part of my depleted sky
ticky-tock, ticky-tock, T.S. Eliot swallowed a clock
it drew me up and I was tethered to the sun
I am my hierophant
be prominent; I miss you
the first thing seen is true
the obligation each man owes himself is buried in the rhythms of his speech
this jacket is the wind I'm moving in

Then Giovanni, a recent graduate of the Poetics program at New College,
read from _Blue Cactus_ and _The Green Book, A Drama in Scenes_, among
other pieces.  Some of her pithier lines included:

names forgive their meaning
this action believes syllables come inward from behind a decision
drums do not go quietly
the world created with symbols is at times noncommittal
there is a time to be silent and a time to be silent
secrets offer a circle
recognition of a mistake does not free one from desire to make it again
interaction can differentiate from competition
I'm a compulsive but sensitive jaywalker
multitasking has something to do with Mercury

Spotted in the crowd were Kevin Killian, Stephanie Baker, Adam Cornford,
Spencer Selby, A.L. Nielsen, Thoreau Lovell, Andrew Joron, Leslie Davis,
Norma Cole, Margie Sloan, Hung Tu, Joe Donahue, Simon Pettet, Jack and
Adelle Foley, Renee Gladman, Tiffany Higgins, Lito Sandoval, Robert Gluck,
Mary Burger, John High, Steve Dickison, Kush, Aaron Shurin, and Pam Lu.

On Monday March 18th there was a Poetics Faculty Reading at New College.
Brilliantly hosted by Michael Price, the reading started off with David
Meltzer reading from _No Eyes_ and, from _Beat Thing_, a hilarious
catalogue of "Beat food":

when you get to Paradise, is it merely nice?
it's all umber, you dig?
when you disappear, fear disappears with you
it's simply zipped and done with mirrors and windows
so, what about Beat food?
wasabi bullet from blasting eyes
feel surge of immortality turn beatnik skins inside out
L.A.'s poor poet horsemeat buffets
suck on paper just to chew as if eating real food.

Lyn Hejinian went next, reading from _A Border Comedy_, from which I excerpt:

brutality delivers nothing but hurry
every work of art is an uncommitted crime
I'm afraid of encountering a specter but I know it's only hope
since we never went to bed, our need for murder is superfluous
"stupid people dismiss as untrue anything that happens seldom"
the driver is dressed in warm cardboard

Then Gloria Frym read a prose poem from a new manuscript called _Tagging_:

it is not as though his personal spirits cannot soar; no...
never have we encountered a poet/butcher; this is perhaps sad.

Adam Cornford followed with some sonnets which included the following lines:

lint drifts ectoplasmic
God binary with Godzilla
the window hangs open like a second thought
the universe, drunk with space, expands faster than it can cohere
warm and difficult as friction, without them I take no step
are you where now is?

To end off the evening, Tom Clark gave an emotion-filled reading of recent
work which included:

not copper-stripped and subject to the worm
all the ballast of familiar life
old moon yearning in the new moon's arms
what they mourn is as shifting and undefined as can be

The audience was the audience.

The very next night played host to another benefit for Prosodia, the New
College literary journal, featuring recent San Francisco resident Duncan
McNaughton, who helped invent the Poetics Program at New College back in
the 70's, and the lovely and talented Marina Lazzara, another recent
graduate.  Marina went first, reading from old work and new, dazzling with
her twisty-linguisty thoughtforms:

planets that carry their fading to us
a slight touch of pond in the rearview mirror
someone takes a rake to clear the cornea of its pond
the garden on my back is a shoe
they wear their hair like a wig although it is their own
postpone the saucer and forgive us of our planets
even over the intense cinema, you are king

Then Duncan regaled us with work from _The Pilot_, _Valparaiso_, a poem
called "Paul Celan Cheers Up", and a "Horse goes into a bar" prose-poem
that kept us in stitches.  Some lines I snatched were:

the perjury of genius
age and death will have their volition
but neither is a fountainhead
isn't there something else about her, that she mustn't end?
sanity--for that one must travel
northerly, and withdrawn, imagination dwells
I have a horse your friend can ride on, now that he can't ride on the breeze
the mask doesn't hide the world, it uncovers it, like Dario says
we put on the mask, and then we go home
all of what one's love becomes capable of is called knowledge
evidently a soul is infinitely apportionable

Present and accounted for this night were the likes of Simon Pettet, Eddie
Berrigan, Steve Dickison, Tina Rotenberg, Steven Jones, Benjamin Hollander,
Stephanie Baker, Maggie Schold, Charlie Palau and Sarah Menefee.

Finally on Sunday the 23rd at Canessa Park, Renee Gladman, Mary Burger,
Hung Tu, Carl Rakosi, June, Eric Selland, Naoko, Larry Fixel, Benjamin
Hollander, Andrew Joron, Michael Price, Adam and Raphael Cornford, Cami
Jones, Kevin Killian, Kenlee, Spencer Selby, Jordon Zorker, Colleen
Lookingbill, Chris Daniels, Pat Reed, Margie Sloan and Giovanni Singleton
gathered to see yet another recent New College grad, Leslie Davis, and New
Yorker Geoffrey O'Brien read.  Leslie read from some newer short poems and
her manuscript _Lucky Pup_.  Behold some fragments:

building a shrine to the lost role of mother
there is something intelligent here in this rain
time imitates a solid line
the ones we chose for ushers became pallbearers
love makes itself felt in the desire for shared sleep
I depend on you you rain on me
once the skin is broken there is no other way

Geoffrey read from _The Floating City_ and _Sonic Ode_, revealing the war
in his work between narrative and music:

he prays to the absence of a voice
at rest he reshapes his ocean
thrust of the sash upward clears thought
the grass came screaming out of the ground
noise body kept viable by fuzz and slam
as if disappearance were a species of music
coralline architecture of lullaby
they puncture the mountain for flute notes
tram gone groggy

Geoffrey finished by reading a hilarious poem based on a dream, complete
with an original dream song with not a half-bad melody.  Then we went to
Enrico's and talked about film noir.

April's gonna be a busy month for poetry here, with readings coming up by
Darin DeStefano, Elizabeth Robinson,  and Chris Daniels on the 5th, Deena
Metzger on the 9th, Rob Hale, Doug Powell and George Albon on the 12th,
John High on the 13th, Avery Burns and Ron Silliman on the 14th, Eileen
Myles on the 15th, Steve McCaffery and Liz Willis on the 19th, Bob Grenier
and Fanny Howe on the 20th, Kristin Prevallet on the 25th (talk on Helen
Adams) and 27th (poetry reading), Barrett Watten on the 26th, Michael
Boughn and Brian Lucas on the 27th, and then Ron Johnson on May Day.  And
that's not counting Kevin Killian's play "The Schwimmer Effect" on April
4th.  Whew!

As a Mass. native and longtime resident/social activist in the Boston
area, I subscribe to a list that posts left activist announcements for the
Eastern Mass. area.  I think folks on the list might be interested in the

Subject: Burma Needs Your Land!

Dear Activists,

As part of the effort to build the boycott against companies supporting the
Burmese dictators, we're planning a "Burma-Slave" publicity campaign based
on  the old Burma-Shave roadside signs. Detailed information on the
Burma-Shave signs (and the new "Burma-Slave" signs) is provided below.

The idea behind this campaign is to set up signs by the sides of roads
bearing short poems which illustrate the connection between Texaco and
UNOCAL and  the repression and brutality in Burma. Ideally, these signs
will be permanent, but in some cases we will have people hold signs in
places where long-term signs can't be placed.

If you own land by the side of a highway or road, or know someone who does,
please contact Nick Jehlen at the address below. If you are interested in
participating in or organizing a Burma Slave protest in your area, please
email the address below with information about where you'd like to set up
the signs and how many people you could bring to a protest.

Burma Shave: History
In 1927 a small company began using a new form of advertising in order to
promote its newest product: brushless shaving cream. They set up a series
of signs by the side of a road, each one with a line of a advertising
slogan on it. Over the next forty years, these signs were put up all over
the country, with hundreds of different slogans - most of them short
rhyming poems, all of them ending with a sign which read "Burma Shave".
(The Burma Shave name comes from the fact that many of the ingredients came
from Burma.) These signs became a favorite pastime for travelers, and were
used for the next forty years in one of the most successful advertising
campaigns ever.

Examples of Burma Shave signs:
don't stick
your elbow
out so far
it might go home
in another car.
Burma-Shave

sleep in a chair
nothing to lose
but a nap
at the wheel
is a permanent snooze
Burma-Shave


Burma-Slave
While boycotts are built one person at a time, to become successful, they
must penetrate the public consciousness. A company's brand-name is a
valuable commodity, and by spreading the word about companies policies
(through a boycott campaign) this commodity is devalued.

The idea behind the original Burma Shave signs was inspire people to watch
for the poems, to read them, to remember them, and to get them to talk to
their friends and family about them. The idea behind the Burma Slave signs
is the same. While we don't expect to put up as many signs, we will spread
the word through media exposure. Many media outlets that would never touch
a boycott story may be more willing to run a story about the rebirth of the
old Burma Shave signs.

Examples of Burma Slave signs:

Burmese children build the roads
to bring you gas
to help you go.
Slave labor is the hidden cost
when you pull into
Texaco.
Burma-Slave

Our money goes
to enslave the masses.
Set burma free
boycott UNOCAL gases.
Burma-Slave


Permanent and Temporary Signs
The ideal place for a set of Burma Slave signs is by the side of a small
highway, on land owned by a supporter. Depending on the speed of the cars
on the road, a set of signs would need between 50 and 250 yards of
road-side space.

In the mean time, we'd like to set up a set of signs by the side of a road
(Memorial Drive or Soldiers Field Road in Boston) with a person holding
each sign up for an hour or two.

Bob & List,

PO-etry CDs are listened to often, but I think I (and the rest us) are
waiting for a ONE shot performance on CD that hits. Tired of the
antho-album. One artist, and without the sense of being backed up but maybe
the sense (like RASA) of being part of the work as a whole. Early attempt
at this (talking Ms. Estep & Mr. such-&-such) are good efforts but are
easily forgetable. If we are as Ed Sanders put-it once, "the daemons urging
toward the mainstream" then take advice from the indi labels that have made
it before. Look at Sup-Pop (for example); making something limited and
exclusive - like a poem 7" a month for a year or two) anything to make it
collectable to people who wouldn't listen to the digital noise usually.

Maybe, even take example from Nicole Blackman's recent release and find the
existing audience of another artist and utilize that to further an ENTIRE
genre of popular culture (perf-po-ing is NOW part of pop culture 'cause of
the likes of all of us that are doing-it PUBLICly.. spearheaded by you of
course :) )

... I don't know, it's odd talking about this on THIS list of all places.
No one wants to hear this here. A different front, a brooding seriousness
about the words, syntax, and sympathy for the phonemes here...

But, since it started here, it should continue. I would LOVE to hear
responses from the fringe!

Robert Creeley and John Wieners will be in Pittsburgh PA on Saturday, April
12th for a reading at the Andy Warhol Museum, which is located in an old
building at 117 Sandusky street (north side). The reading starts at 7:30
and is held in conjunction with the opening of a special exhibition of
Francesco Clemente's portraits (including Creeley's and Wiener's).
Admission to the museum (and the reading) is $6, $5 for senior citizens and
$4 for students.
        And if you happen to find yourself in Pittsburgh this summer (like,
say you've committed a crime against the state and are exiled there), the
Clemente exhibit is up through August 31.

Yes. The CD is available with a German label (I think it is Ars Acoustica or

The US company Mode has a 2-CD set of Cage "Reading Through Finnegans
Wake", the hour-long horspiel "Roaratorio" of sounds collaged over this
vocal track, & an interview with Cage about the works.  The German label
Wergo has released a CD of just Roaratorio).

FWIW, I don't think Cage is putting on an Irish accent, it's just the way
his intoning voice sounds regardless of the source material for the text.

I'd also recommend cris cheek's Skin Upon Skin & Nate Mackey's Strick in
the spoken CD category.

Bests,

Herb

Good work, Steve, summarizing all these dates.  May I, Kevin Killian, add a
few more events happening this week in Bay Area?  Tonight, April 3, Harry
Mathews at the Alliance Francaise; Monday, Jeanette Winterson at Diesel;
Tuesday, David Sedaris at Rizzoli and I believe it's April 10th, Robin

just thought people should know that the Elephantine parody call for
papers long predates the Sokal affair, and was not simply a
science-technology attack on cultstuds -- I was first handed a copy of
this thing four years ago by a colleague in the philosophy department -- I
think, like the term "politically correct," it may have had its origins in
self-parody and then been seized upon for use by people with little or no
sense of humor -- intersting to see it reappear as it works its way
through our culture -- one might even make a study of the culture of
circulation as it moves from xerox room bulletin board to electronic
bulletin board -- one might even give a conference paper on it!

Dear Steve (Carll) and all,

Barrett Watten's not reading by himself on April 26th! He's reading with me:

                Jean Day / Barrett Watten
                New Langton Arts
                1246 Folsom St.
                San Francisco
                8:00 pm (I think)

We'll both be reading from new books--his is FRAME from Sun & Moon, mine
THE LITERAL WORLD from Xenos.

Hastily,

Jean

I keep reading the poem "splash" from "Betting on the Muse".
To me this poem seems to be a description of Buk's special
kind of narrative style.
The style he kept sharpening til the end.

On the other hand this poem also has a feel to it that is
reminiscent of Buk's early more surrealistic poems.

This caused me to wonder about when this poem first
appeared.

I know many of the poems in BOTM are from the early 60's, but
I haven't been able to pinpoint were/when "splash" was first
published.

Do any of you out there know?
Anyone else like this poem?

All this wondering gives me something to do while waiting for
"Bone Palace Ballet"

Well, I'm glad to no longer have homework... but I like to listen to
bits of Cage's Empty Words while I'm working (whether it's the Italian
Riot mix or the Coney Island Sun Ra collaboration depends on my mood) as
well as Jackson Mac Low and the Four Horsemen.

Yes, it's available on CD from Mode and from Wergo (though I strongly
recommend the Mode double-CD which has the complete spoken track on its
own (the Wergo, I believe, contains one section) as well as a long
recorded interview and two very thick booklets, one of which contains
the complete mesostic.

REPOST TO PROFESSIONAL-ISSUES/ACADEMIC-LABOR LISTS

Delegate-L, a discussion list for MLA members interested in public and
institutional policy affecting the study and teaching of the humanities.

For the first time ever, members of the Modern Language Association will
be able to discuss freely, on a year-round basis, the issues and actions
that they would like the MLA Delegate Assembly to consider.

institutional policy affecting the study and teaching of the humanities and
the status of the language and literature professions represented by the
association. Such matters may include proposed or enacted legislation,
regulations, or other governmental and institutional policies, conditions of
employment and publication, or additional matters that affect the
association, its members in their professional capacities, or the dignity of
members' work"(MLA Const.9.C.10).

other governance responsibilities of the MLA Delegate Assembly is
appropriate to delegate-l.

& quoth Daniel Zimmerman:

<<Title for conference paper: "Elephants All The Way Down.">>

a nice reminder of the turtles tale that (it seems) I heard Ram Dass
tell (in talk at UCLA circa '70 -- tempus is fugiting still) . . .

but anent the Elephant -- coincidentally, on the Indology listproc
in the past day or two, Elephants have surface.  Not related to the
call-for-papers satire; rather, quest-for-Pali-text references (re: the
"blind men & the elephant" allegorical tale -- attributed to the
Buddha) -- said cites being duly provided, & further refs. to
Rumi's version (in the Mathnawi) being likewise noted.  So if
anyone gets "serious" abt. an elephant paper (or conference or
whatnot), let me know & I'll zap you w/ the footnote fodder.

Reminds me of chain letters/urban legends.  One of the things I've just
received  (from two separate sources) is this scary message warning people
on the internet not to open any messages entitled "penpal," which
alledgedly conceals a virus that wipes your hard drive, then mails out
copies to everyone on your mailing list.  It's a hoax, but just scary
enough to make anyone nervous (sort of like the one about the gangsta
initiation ritual of driving around in a car with the headlights out and
shooting anyone who flashes their highbeams at them).

Just a note. The disease that features oversized feet etc, is called not

Subject:      more soapbox BLASTS

Since I can't go to the rutgers conference on "poetry & the public sphere",
I'm filling up webspace with an (im)pertinent blast again, maybe some well-
meaning conference attender can make use of this in some way.  The Poetry
Mission was started with thoughts around this question, and on Apr 23rd
we're hosting a public forum ourselves to assess poetry's public role.
We're inviting writers and others to bring poems & statements to contribute.

This is a draft of my own personal blast.  It's probably too long & prosaic
for what we're planning.  So use it or abuse it, rutgerzians.

ROLE OF POETRY

    Poetry like humanity is capable of standing erect on its own two feet, and
this has been one of the motivating ideas of the Poetry Mission.  We started
this project believing that poetry can & should make itself heard in a free
and open civic space, mediated as little as possible by large and peripheral
institutions.

    However, as I tried ot prepare for today's event, I came to the conclusion
that for me, at least, this social role exists in tandem with a more narrowly
intellectual role.  I say poetry plays a role which is _at least_ as major as
that of any of the human or pure sciences, in revealing whatever universal
realities are accessible to human beings.  This particular claim has been
rejected again and again--first, by those who deny poetry's propositional
efficacy; second, by those who accept the unbridgeable chasm between the
arts and sciences; and third, by those who, in the name of postmodernism
or various economic determinisms, deny meaning to either rationality or
tradition.  In order for poetry to stand on a par with the other arts and
sciences, it must first of all acknowledge its own didactic potential--
as giving form to a criticism of life, in the school of bitter and ecstatic
experience.  Secondly, it must come to terms with science _on its own terms_--
recognizing a shared creative process in the formation of scientific concepts,
while rejecting a dehumanized (and profane) scientific positivism.

    These demands on poetry will strike many of you, I'm sure, as absurdly
academic.  And if there weren't something more than this, your scepticism
would be justified.  But in my view poetry stakes its claim to stand among
the arts and sciences--even, perhaps, at their matrix--_not_ because of its
status as "Queen of the Arts", or as the quintessential expression of
aesthetic values.  Poetry, by the most basic means--by means of the individual
human voice--fulfills, sanctions, and profoundly _transcends_ aesthetics.
The theory of poetry--as Dante, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Wallace
Stevens, and Paul Celan, among others, conceive it--rests on a theory of
reality.  This theory stands distinct from science, on the one hand, and
nihilism, on the other.  You might call it an Orphic theory of reality.
I find it difficult to encapsulate in a phrase, but it might go as follows:
_the Universe is a vast meaningful riddle of animate signs.  Our destiny is
to spell them out._  Or, as Shakespeare's Master Shallow [I think] put it
more concisely: _All's figures._

    I thought I would end my statement there, but I find I've left out the
really important, paradoxical thing.  By giving form to the free, _unofficial_,
undogmatic human voice, poetry is empowered to _declare its ignorance_--
to put experience before abstraction, the heart before the mind.  In so
doing, poetry draws its most subtle, most scandalous, most dangerous, most
_perfect_ image of the truth.

Does the Mode double-CD version have the complete spoken 120 page version of
the writing through the wake? In the Wergo version, there is a 14 minute solo
for the 40 page reduction, the same one that he reads in the hour-long horspiel

Charles,

Xenos is Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz's new series--THE LITERAL WORLD is
imminent, as is another new one from Barrett Watten, part or all of BAD

post it myself.

The Daily News said 4 months to a year.

If it wasn't for Howl, I would have broken down in Pennsyvania; it was my
first epiphany. I found it at a local bookshop when it first came out; I
was around 13 at the time and already depressive.

Actually I think it's done for people who have cats.  I'm really looking
forward to daylight savings time so Blanche and Stanley will quit trying to
wake me up at 6:30 in the morning to feed them.

I was about 13, too, when I first heard of Allen Ginsberg from my
7th-grade English teacher who clandestinely read us the beginning of Howl.
All I remember was that it wasn't the sing-songy verse we were usually
fed. I also remember wondering why our English teacher was being so
secretive. This was in 1965 or 1966. Now I know why and now I also know
that things haven't changed nearly enough.

sadly,
Steven

i've never met allen ginsberg but i was within arms reach of him one late
afternoon many years ago. stephen rodefer was having allen talk about jack
kerouac for one of his ucsd literature classes and invited me to drop in. i
remember walking to the lecture hall and allen was walking in front of me
amidst a small crowd of people trying to get through the door. and i
remember he was wearing this dopey dark blue polyester sport coat and i
remember that nobody seemed to notice him really and i had the urge to tap
him on the shoulder and say "what's up with this ginsberg goofball anyway?"
but i didn't and obviously i've regretted it over all these years. and i've
regretted it because i've come to understand what a large and open sense of
humor he has.

This is sad, tho expected, news. I've had dreams in the past of receiving
such information, which I suppose says much about the depth to which he's
entered my own consciousness. I've always found Allen, in my limited
experience, to be among the most generous, open, encouraging, and dedicated
members of the poetry community. A leader in so many ways...

God bless him...

The state of Arizona doesn't change either. So part of the year we're on
mountain time, part on Pacific time. I suppose that means we're getting
ready to be on Pacific time again. I can't say that it's either an
advantage or a disadvantage. In the summer here I'd really rather have the
cooler nights come sooner, not later.

Subject:      Allen Ginsberg's death

Here is the great equalizer, it would seem. Language is slippery,
pronouns are fuzzy, poetry is not poetry. But death? Death is death,
and there it is, no experimental messing with it.

I suspect Ginsberg would not want any sentimental sniffling. He's
been talking about death for a long time. I remember at the Orono
conference in--was it--'93? I approached Ginsberg after
his reading there and introduced myself as the person who had edited
the Buddhist anthology of contemporary American poets in which he
prominently figured. I was sure he
owuld be impressed, probably would embrace me warmly, since clearly
this was the most important anthology to appear in post-war America,
intro by Gary Snyder, numerous avant-garde poets along with big
mainstreams, unknowns, etc. He had a red bandanna tied to four corners
around his head, sipped deeply on a soda and said in a decidedly
laconic way: Oh, so yu're the guy who did that... And then he turned
and started talking to someone else.

I felt hurt and felt resentlful for a good time after that--
especially after riding back to the motel in the same van
with him and he was yakkety yakketing with Marjorie Perloff and
Jerome McGann and it was as if I was not there. Invisible. Look Allen,
I have adored you, wanted to be like you, wondered what it would be
like to walk down the street with you, read you out loud with my
friends inthe bar, and all you can do after I edit a Buddhist
anthology of poetry is treat me like shit.

Did I think to myself: I wish you would die, motherfucker. (but no,
no, I don't mean that,that's a wrong thing to feel, that's jsut my
drunkenness, I'm not that kind of dperson...)

And of course he will. And of course all of us will. The intensity
comes out of the factness of death, doesn't it, like a beatnik on acid
with beads, staring us in the face with all of his teeth? Now I
realize death was probably teaching me a lesson, saying so what if
you did so and so, you sorry idiot? No merit.

So don't be sad. I'll bet Allen wouldn't want it that way. But then
again, I could be worng. And only death will prove us all, in the end,
immaculately right. Right?

Singing "Father Death" & Blake's Songs, Allen's left more life than death
can take away. Don't feel bad, Kent. He brushed me off once, after I read
a few poems at the WCW festival in Paterson, as "very intelligent." No
blame. Om Kavaye Namah. [Honor to the Great Poet.]

I'm not trying to be smart, but when you say that Allen left more life

Not scared, but struck by the sublime: that 18th century sense of the
awe-ful or, as Blake says, who died singing of angels, the "terrific":
"portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man." Scared of what?

As if that would be a terrible thing? Oh, awful death. Let us not,
for it is not to be spoken of. Now since death is so pornographic,
what will be the first line of this renga?

I've been away from the list for a while -- but will say this --

I was once standing on my own several yards away from where Ginsberg was
talking quietly with a group of admirers after a reading here in San Jose
-- He saw me there alone, broke away from the group -- came over and asked
how it was with me, did I write, what did I write, how did the community
fare since his few San Jose days "In Back of the Real" --

There are few in my experience so generous with themselves as he has been
-- any of us, I'm sure, might on occasion be distracted, brusque --
whatever -- Few have been such a tireless champion of the writing of
others, even others he didn't know --

We had a wonderful short talk that night about poetry, about poets we
knew, about local labor history --

the stars seemed more acute as we turned back toward the town

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

To all who know critic and editor Lou Stathis:

It is certainly sad that Ginsberg is dying--especially now, after
he had just sold his papers for an amazing amount of money and would
have lived out the rest of his days in long-deserved comfort. However,
Ginsberg's place in history is secure and his visitors will be legion:
I doubt he would benefit emotionally from receiving visits from blurred
acquaintances like me. Given the relative consolations of G's notoreity,
I must regretfully leave him to his myriad of friends, and mention a writer
whom I'm hoping will not die unremembered and unattended. His name is
Lou Stathis, and as an editor and benevolent presence, he has been a
constant boon to innumerable struggling writers in NYC. In addition,
he was a discerning critic and lip-smart writer who taught a generation
of readers about alternative culture. Recently, he inherited (congenitally)
a writer's worst fate: a brain-tumor which left him without the
ability to read, write, or formulate intelligible sentences. Still--
beyond his language impasse, one can still sense Lou's intelligence
and sensitivity--even in his gropings for words he can no longer reach.
He is not expected to outlive Ginsberg, and I am asking anyone who has
ever known Lou or enjoyed his writing to please visit him at the Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital on 167th Street in New York City. Let him know
that his work is important and that his life does matter. Today, when
Darius James and I visited him, he was extremely weak and sad. Even so, he
managed to say, "I'm still in here. It's still me. It's still me."

All best always,

Rob Hardin

I like the assertion that Indianapolis will up and move to the
central time zone. How mobile, and when you think that even for
indiana, the polis outs the right, and as for crhistians, as my
grandmother would say, don't ask, how breezy of it.

The rest of the state (exc a cple of counties where they don't play
with snakes in church) has to stay where it is, here, and go on with
the same old god's own time, which is, and we have it on the best
authority, right now, eastern time. Of course, when the rest of the
eastern time goes on daylight, the true eastern reads suspiciously
like central. But that's the east for you. Central. Don't trust it.

The Mode set includes the whole text in both audio & print form, though the
printed text is in extremely tiny type, even by CD booklet standards - it
looks like a photo-reduction of the first publication, including the
scattered punctuation marks.

OK, a first line:

BTW, if a renga evolves, I *will* keep on top of this one and try to

Kent, it is never too late to stop and not smell the cat's milk. Please,
Loss, cut "smelling of" and let cat's milk simply be cat's milk (my opinion,
good edit). First thought, Second thought...

(The two pieces below were to have been sent out with the html page sent
yesterday; I hesitate to send them today, but they're commentary that
explains the other post. I apologize as well for the obscurity of this
stuff; it's concerned directly with the poetics of cyberspace, an area
that's still little explored. I promise to cut back here.)

__________________________________________________________________________



HTML-BODY: Explanation

<!--Alan writes his desires; Jennifer receives the page--><BR>
<!--Agreeable Alan dreams his way across Jennifer--><BR>
<!--Writing, punctuated by warnings, corrupts his body--><BR>
<!--"You are ALL TEXT," Jennifer says--><BR>
<!--"There's nothing to me," Agreeable Alan--><BR>

Another experiment in wryting the html body, exp.htm uses _alert_ buttons
among the viewer, "Jennifer," and "Alan"; links and targets simply shudder
the page slightly, as if a tremor went through the body. Certain links
leave text altogether, sink to the lower and blank margins of the page, a
non-inscriptive ground, divided by a series of horizontal lines / plateaus
from the body of the text. And the body itself turns on the phrase "you
spread me on your screen," like jelly, like jam, like roadkill or sexual
arousal - a phrase which appears through the majority of alerts.

The mouse moves across the field, stumbling over the poor simulacrum of
skin, the body with organs (BWO), javascript, html, tcp/ip. One _enters_
the text, alerts protrude, freeze the body until cancelled. And as for the
rest? The surface? Speaking less than the interior, but hardly less intel-
ligent or inscribed; the surface in fact is an intelligent surface, blank
of image, refusing to give way _beneath._

Because of the nature of email lists, these accounts have used at most two
text files; other html-body-works here, it can only be noted, use up to 35
files, border on obscenity, and can't be introduced here. It is not that I
desire blind-html, imageless, text-hysteric; it's that there is an addi-
tional dialog, with email, that reconstructs the possible.

Strange how the sudden announcement of the death hits so hard, even though
its imminence was known before. One had thought to have a few months to
prepare for it, as if preparation for anyone's death were ever possible. But
to say goodbye.
Anything by way of poetry more specific to this death on the part of those
who were not his intimates is likely to ring with the hollowness of funeral
elegies. Among Jews the ritual of sitting shive--a week of visiting with the
family, who stay at home, cared for by others, and receive vistors--is
accompanied by the ritual, tho unprescribed, telling of anecdotes about the
dead, most often of a comic or endearing nature. The memory of other deaths
invariably present. But even that degree of commentary has to wait the 24
hours until after the burial--time for a few deep breaths. The shock of
intimate loss is incoherent, the building of verbal monuments by others at
that point unseemly. Elegies are made of stone, and headstones aren't placed
at Jewish graves until a year after the death, which is supposed to mark the
end of mourning, although in my experience it doesn't so much end as mature.
I guess what I'm saying is that a little silence right now might go a long
way. The media will clobber us with enough noise about this.
Liver cancer is a horrible way to die. I hope he got some help.

I'm with you Kent & Alan. Listening right now to P. Glass's "Wichita Vortex
Sutra" which sounds all of a sudden like ave atque vale.

And I'm truly surprised by how hard and how deeply Allen's death is
affecting me. I've driven around town today in a weird daze, everything
feeling and looking uncanny, as if a great silent shockwave had passed
through the world and nobody's noticed, nobody's noticed at all. And
everything is the same and goes on being the same, just as it ought. It
ought to be the same. Only it isn't and it can't be. But it's the same all
the same and only this very weird feeling of a tiny vacuum at the center of
things.

I never knew Allen; only brushed by him twice in passing as it were. The
first time was 1989 at City Lights, the day before the quake and the Series
and I was handing out copies of a miserable poetry rag I'd put together and
which is best forgotten but we bumped into each other at the crowded front
counter and naturally being alert for  favorable omens I was delighted. The
second time was last year in Anselm Hollo's backyard where I found myself
sitting, rather like Aldon, apart from the main group, on a lawn chair, and
Allen and his nephew I guess it was Al came up and joined my wife and I and
Lindsay Hill. We were all eating veggie burgers and watermelon and I thought
how frail Allen looks and then he and Lindsay talked a bit about somebody's
mother, maybe it was Steven Marks'? maybe not - the name has faded. He was
wearing bright red suspenders which I put into a poem a few days later. And
that was all very funny really since I'd panned his last book in a brief
review I'd done for the Daily Camera and was mortally afraid to introduce
myself in case someone had told him about it and that review was how Anselm
Hollo and I met, by vigourous exchange of letter, and eventually led me to
joining the list so I owe it this chance of expression and amends I guess in
retrospect to my hubristic attempt to take Allen Ginsberg down a notch what
a silly thing to do and I will miss him who else has done more for poetry
and there should be a state funeral if there was such a thing as a state
with honor that could see itself that way but then what need for Allen
Ginsberg except the example of his beauty and anyway such ceremonies are
deceptive flatteries that cannot take the place or can they of real grieving
as this list will do very nicely even better for that I say.

I intend to get drunk tonight and watch Jerry Aronson's "The Life & Times of
Allen Ginsberg."

GINSBERG AT 70

Big red X of suspenders

Piping down the valleys wild
Piping songs of pleasant glee
On a cloud I saw a child..
And he laughing said to me.

Pipe a song about a Lamb:
So I piped with merry chear,
Piper pipe that song again
So I piped he wept to hear.

Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe
Sing thy songs of happy chear
So I sung the same again
While he wept with joy to hear.

Piper sit thee down and write
In a book that all my read --
So he vanish'd from my sight,
And I plucked a hollow reed

And I made a rural pen,
And I stain'd the water clear,
And I wrote my happy songs,
Every child may joy to hear

not yet. just having a quiet time. it's raining outside, like it's crying
in my heart; what *is* this lethargy that penetrates my heart?

~~~~~~~~~~
d.i.'s comment: by way of "found poetry" (or "found cyber-renga
lines"), I'd like to propose incorporating lines from these posts nto
the renga.

Question as to form: [In present instance at least], is it alright to
have 2 (or even 3) lines in succession from the *same* poet?  I'm
rather vague on "renga rules," but suspect this had not been
traditionally done.  Still, if nobody objects, I'll lift a some lines in
succession from the above. [See the results, and then judge.]

(Others may edit, as suitable.)

Caveat: naturally, respective poets can vito, edit, or whatnot.  I'm

I'm with you Kent & Alan. Listening right now to P. Glass's
"Wichita Vortex Sutra" which sounds all of a sudden like ave
atque vale.

And I'm truly surprised by how hard and how deeply Allen's
death is affecting me.
<snip>
I never knew Allen; only brushed by him twice in passing as it
were. <snip>
. . . The second time was last year in Anselm Hollo's backyard
where I found myself sitting, rather like Aldon, apart from the main
group, on a lawn chair, and Allen and his nephew I guess it was
Al came up and joined my wife and I and Lindsay Hill. We were all
eating veggie burgers and watermelon and I thought how frail
Allen looks . . .

d.i.'s comment:  Pat, would you permit me to put that last line into
the renga above?  (That becomes, here, renga line 14.)

Note F:   Okay, I'm putting in my own line (line 15) at this piont.

/ / / / /

Folks: will this work, as method?  Care to take it up & go further?

(The fact that the death-announcement occurred mid-Renga
does render this a unique cyberRenga, I'd say.)

Do consider Sondheim's suggestion of not including ENTIRE
posts, but just clipping out the renga & adding a line to it.  The
method he suggests -- "forrwarding" rather than "replying" is one
way to avoid the carets.  (Or: whatever.)

Folks,

having sent out that back-to-cyberRenga post (& then reread
same), realize I was amiss re: the 2 & 3 line entries -- (both for
reason of form and bec. the single lines seem to work better).

I write you a poem long ago
already my feet are washed in death
Here I am naked without identity
with no more body than the fine black tracery of pen marks on soft paper
as star talks to star multiple beams of sunlight all the same myriad
        thought
in one fold of the universe where Whitman was
and Blake and Shelley saw Milton dwelling in a starry temple brooding in
        his blindness seeing all -
Now at last I can speak to you beloved brothers of an unknown moon

from "POEM Rocket" in Kaddish

yes, good catch.  (And daresay that line prob. works better than
the daisy line for line 1).  I'll put it in & readjust accordingly.

best,
d.i.

p.s.: just got Peter Jaeger's quotation of lines from Ginsberg
himself.  Allowing (majorly) for principle of serendipity, I've added
the final line from that excerpt (now line 15, see below).

Okay, now I'll turn this back over to you'all.

Perhaps a passage from Ginsberg himself would go nicely here:

Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on
the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.

downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night, talking,
talking, reading Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues shout blind
on the phonograph

the rhythm the rhythm--and your memory in my head three years after--And
read Adonais' last triumphant stanzas aloud--wept, realizing how we
suffer--

And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember prophesy
as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist book of answers--and my own
imagination of a withered leaf--at dawn--

Dreaming back thru life, Your time--and mine accelerating toward Apocalypse,

the final moment--the flower burning in the Day--and what comes after. . .

Grant, as you'll have noted (before you read these words), in latest
update (my so-called "version #3"), a line from Kaddish *was*
put in as (new) line #15.

Also agree it would be fine to put in more from Ginsberg and
Kaddish.  Must say, as I'm "learning on the fly" here abt.
cyberRenga form, I do feel it's best to always alternate poets w/
lines -- if not in some oldworld orderly way (i.e., poet a, b, c, a, b, c,
etc.) at least not havving any aa's or bb's -- ergo, how about,
Grant, you select a line of Ginsberg's (from your noted selection)
and put it in yourself? -- hopefully by time you do that, someone
will have added another line (new line 16 [or, et seq.]), so that we
won't have Ginsberg *immediately* following Ginsberg  . . .  but
yes, I'm sure there's room for many lines from him -- & in a
cyberRenga, I suppose the addition of such lines depends on the
poster/poets -- submit a line of your own or (in some cases) of
Ginsberg's (or even others' -- in fact, to get that ball rolling, I'll put
in a line from Gary Snyder right now . . .!) --

Note re: the Snyder line (from poem "High Quality Information"):
this is from memory.  Though it's a fave poem, not sure I recall the
line aright (a word or two might be off -- so it can to be corrected
later by someone with a book -- it's from North Point Press vol.
*Left Out in the Rain*).

Also to note: it's great that Joseph Zitt is doing the web-based
hypertext on this.  As for me, I expect to be getting on an airplane
(to Calif.) in abt. 9 hours -- & thus prob. won't be able to check out
the website (or the further renga-route) for a certain while.

Don't know which Ray Charles song it was that Ginsberg was listening to --
but Charles's big hit of that day went to the rhythm and melody of:
"There's a man going 'round taking names"

As Charles transmuted the sacred into the erotic ("I got a woman, way
across town, she's good to me") -- Ginsberg must have heard a kindred
spirit

Thanks for the note.  Do hope it proceeds & goes well.  (I'll be
heading out of town in less than 10 hours, so I might not be back
with this for a some while . . . )

I guess it's mainly the fact that the renga starting happening on
eve (& then in the midst) of the descent of the "news," that might
lend it particular note.  I can also understand the poss. reticence
of some to chime in at this point.  (Perhaps it'll revive, as might be

Charles, I am glad that you quoted that poem. I have been today and
yesteday trying to call up all my Allen memories since first talking with
him on his return from Asia, 1963. And you reminded me of the time I drove
Allen westward thru the streets of Montreal, probably 1969, and he sat
beside me and sang that song, pumping on that weird meoleon or whatever it
was from India. so I veered off the street and took him and banged on F.R.
Scott's door, and introduced the 2 poets, and Frank made one  of his famous
martinis for us, and I do believe that AG drank his, too.

No need for apologies, David, as far as I can see.  And there was nothing
"superficial" about your "dabbling"--that's just *writing*.  I think
Kent's right that everyone will deal with the news in their own way, and
in their own time.  As it happens, I feel like writing--out of the sense
expressed by others of Allen's death sudden and hard, harder even than
might have been expected.  I saw/heard Allen "live" on two occasions, most
recently at the Orono Confernece in '93.  There, thanks to Burt Hatlen's
generosity, I got the chance to introduce Allen's tandem reading with Carl
Rakosi.  That double reading was a moving & beautiful event for me, a
bridging and spanning of poetic lives & energies drawing on experience of
the better part of the century (Carl 88 at the time).  The other time I
heard Allen read was when i was an undergrad at U of MD, College Park, ca.
'83 or '84.  I think Allen must have read, or rather performed, for about
an hour and a half or 2 hours--reciting, chanting, singing & playing that
little harmonium--or whatever it's called.  As i recall, he did it all
from memory, no recourse at all to the printed word, a real
bard--something i have not heard/seen anyone do since. I made a tape,
using a cheap little portable recorder, and just now, remarkably, i
managed to dig this tape out of an old box of junk.  I rewound it to the
beginning of a side, which turned out to be side 2, coming in somewhere in
the   middle of the reading.  The first words are Allen asking a question
"Go on...?" asking the audience whether he shld keep going, and the crowd
responding w/ rousing affirmation. (As i remember it, it was a not very
large room filled to overflowing, people standing in the corners & sitting
on the floors, spilling out into the halls--the tape is full of sounds of
people gabbing, chatting & laughing between & sometimes during poems.)
Then Allen begins talking about the death of his father from cancer, &
reads 2 sections from "Don't Grow Old," and then sings/plays "Father Death
Blues."  My first listen-thru to this sitting at the kitchen table sent a
chill up my spine, & then when i tried to play it again the tape began to
self-destruct, but i did manage to transcribe Allen's intro to the poems:

"1976--On the death of my father, Louis Ginsberg, who was a poet...who was
a considerably gifted lyric poet...& for the 10 years before he died, at
the age of 80, I gave poetry readings with him & we were relatively close.
He died of cancer in 1976, in a relatively philosophic mood, without much
pain.  So these are a few notes & a song written during his illness &
after his death.  He was a high school teacher & he used to teach
Wordsworth...and, uh, Poe.  So I've learned a lot of poetry from him..."

[reads sections 3&4 of "Don't Grow Old"]  (Even on this very poor tape,
his wonderfully warm, expressive, charismatic, humorous, playful voice
comes over.)

III.

Wasted arms, feeble knees
        80 years old, hair thin & white
                cheek bonier than I'd remembered--
head bowed on his neck, eyes opened
        now and then, he listened--
  I read my father Wordsworth's *Intimations of Immortality*
[Allen reads following quote w/ deep and comical sonority]
"...trailing clouds of glory do we come
        from God, who is our home..."
                "That's beautiful," he said, "but it's not true."

"When I was a boy, we had a house
        on Boyd Street, Newark--the backyard
                was a big empty lot full of bushes and tall grass,
        I always wondered what was behind those trees.
When I grew older, I walked around the block,
        and found out what was back there--
                it was a glue factory."

[as read, father's story hits quite funny note of anticlimax, audience
laughs--Allen helping them to see this humor even in death]


IV.

[Reads opening question w/ great, childish credulity]

Will that happen to me?
Of course, it'll happen to thee.

Will my arms wither away?
Yes yr arm hair will turn gray.

Will my knees grow weak & collapse?
Your knees will need crutches perhaps.

Will my chest get thin?
Your breasts will be hanging skin.

Where will go--my teeth?
You'll keep the ones beneath.

What'll happen to my bones?
They'll get mixed up with stones.



[Goes on to play & sing "Father Death Blues"...]

     April 5, 1997
     Beat Poet Laureate Ginsberg Dies

     NEW YORK (AP) -- Allen Ginsberg, the poet laureate of the Beat
     Generation whose writing and lifestyle shaped the music, politics
     and protests of the next 40 years, died this morning. He was 70.

     Ginsberg died in his Lower East Side apartment at 2:39 a.m. of a
     heart attack related to his terminal liver cancer, said Bill
     Morgan, his friend and archivist. The poet was surrounded by family
     and friends.

     Ginsberg suffered from chronic hepatitis for years, which
     eventually led to cirrhosis of the liver. His diagnosis of terminal
     liver cancer was made eight days ago and made public on Thursday.
     He suffered a stroke Thursday night and slipped into a coma.

     Ginsberg has spent several days in a hospice after the diagnosis,
     but then decided he wanted to return home.

     ``He was very energetic,'' Morgan said. ``He wore himself out
     (Thursday) talking to friends and writing poems.''

     He wrote about a dozen short poems on Wednesday. One of the last
     was titled ``On Fame and Death''; others ran the gamut from nursery
     rhymes to politics.

     During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, when TV's married couples
     slept in separate beds, Ginsberg wrote ``Howl'' -- a profane,
     graphic poem that dealt with his own homosexuality and communist
     upbringing.

     ``I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness,
     starving hysterical naked, '' began the seminal ``Howl.'' It was
     dedicated to Carl Solomon, a patient he met during a stay in a
     psychiatric ward.

     Ginsberg became America's most popular and recognizable poet, his
     balding, bearded visage one of the enduring images of the 1950s
     beatnik explosion of Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Neal
     Cassady. The group, disillusioned with conventional society,
     created their own subculture.

     Ginsberg's acolytes comprised a who's who of pop culture: Bob
     Dylan, Yoko Ono, Vaclav Havel, Patti Smith, Michael Stipe and Billy
     Corgan.

     Irwin Allen Ginsberg was born June 3, 1926, in Newark, N.J., the
     second son of poet Louis Ginsberg and his wife, Naomi. The family
     moved to Paterson, N.J., while Ginsberg was a youngster.

     Ginsberg intended to become a lawyer and enrolled at Columbia
     University. But while still a teen-ager, he fell in with a crowd
     that included Kerouac, Burroughs and Cassady -- the leaders of what
     became known as the Beat Generation.

     ``I think it was when I ran into Kerouac and Burroughs when I was
     17 that I realized I was talking through an empty skull,'' Ginsberg
     once said. ``I wasn't thinking my own thoughts or saying my own
     thoughts.''

     Ginsberg's first taste of notoriety came after the publication of
     ``Howl'' in 1956. Copies of the book were seized by San Francisco
     police and U.S. Customs officials, and publisher Lawrence
     Ferlinghetti was charged with publishing an obscene book.

     Ferlinghetti was acquitted a year later, but the case generated
     enormous publicity for Ginsberg and his work. Ginsberg was suddenly
     in demand.

     One of his other great works, ``Kaddish,'' was a confessional work
     dealing with his mother's life and death in a mental hospital. It
     was written, stream of consciousness-style, in his Manhattan
     apartment, fueled by a combination of amphetamines and morphine.

     Ginsberg experimented heavily with drugs, taking LSD under the
     guidance of the late Timothy Leary in the 1960s.

     As he grew older, Ginsberg became a guru to the counterculture
     movement. He coined the term ``flower power.'' He was arrested in
     1967 for protesting against the Vietnam War in New York, and
     tear-gassed a year later while protesting at the Democratic
     convention in Chicago.

     His National Book Award came in 1973 for ``The Fall of America:
     Poems of These States, 1965-1971.'' He was a finalist for a
     Pulitzer Prize in poetry in 1995 for his book, ``Cosmopolitan
     Greetings: Poems 1986-1992.''

     Ginsberg toured with Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue in 1977, doing
     spontaneously composed blues poems. He toured Eastern Europe in
     1986, receiving an award in the former Yugoslavia, recording with a
     Hungarian rock band and meeting a congress of young Polish poets.

     ``In the Eastern bloc, the people realize the governments are up to
     no good, whereas Americans still maintain that the government is
     looking after their best interest,'' Ginsberg said at the time.

     Ginsberg remained vital and active well into his 60s, performing in
     Manhattan nightclubs and doing poetry readings. Last year, he
     recorded his poem ``The Ballad of the Skeletons'' with musical
     backing from Paul McCartney and Philip Glass.

     He did a video version of the poem, a pre-election political rant.
     At 69, Ginsberg's video appeared in heavy rotation on MTV's ``Buzz
     Bin.''

     The funeral will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations should
     be sent to Jewel Heart Buddhist Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Tonight at War Resister's Benefit, Grace Paley tells wonderful AG tale, as

Kimiko Hahn reads "tomb" section of Moloch/Howl...
David Henderson reads Bob Kaufman's "To Ginsberg Allen" from SOLITUDES

I read "Nazi Capish" (from new Longshot), new verses "Amazing Grace," "After

Washington Square Church), "America" end, starting with "America you don't
really want to go to war."
It was a great place to be tonight. WRL is 75 years old next year.

All day swamped with grief I just sit, all day swamped with grief. Allen, the
great orchestrator, has outdone himself with his passing.

Summer 1975, I've just moved to New York, with roommate Steve
Hamilton go to call on Allen since we're living in the poetry fortress,
437 E. 12th Street, where Allen also lives; we sit in the kitchen and,
among a variety of topics, Allen tells us, "you can never experience your
own death"

what an awful feeling now, so strange to think of him gone

All of yesterday and today at the Austin International Poetry Festival,
people have been performing pieces for and about Ginsberg (Friday in
honor, Saturday in memory). I heard about a wonderful event that
erupted at one venue, where various parts of the audience got into
chanting sections of his name while other recited bits of his poetry.

My group will be performing "Hum Bom" tomorrow night -- we had been
thinking of retiring that piece, but it seems appropriate to do it
one more time.

first time i met ginsberg 1977 he told me how great peter was in bed and
quoted the tempest to me. (he was making chicken soup with grapes; i sd,
that looks pretty potent, he sd, this so potent magic i do abjure, what's
that from. i sd tempest, he sd any student of the tempest is a friend of
mine, and are u related to s foster damon. no, i sd, it used to be diamond,
i'm half jewish.  why only half he sd.)  later that summer i spent a few
minutes in bed w/ him before i bailed.
the last time i saw ginsberg 1996 was at St Marks do for Bob Kaufman. we
both presented stuff along w/ many others. (i'd had many encounters w/ him
in between, and often he seemed petulant and distracted as i was awkward
around him and not of the right gender for commanding his attention.  one
time i wove him a white silk opera scarf.  when i gave it to him he sd
what's an opera scarf, i sd it's what they all wear in proust novels, so he
seemed happy with it or at least gracious about accepting it.)  so, last
time i saw ginsberg about a year ago after the kaufman evening's ceremonies
i pulled him aside and said, allen i want to tell you something i think you
would understand. when i saw bob kaufman's ashes i put some of them in my
mouth.  he said, yes, that's a very common understandable impulse, eating
the ashes of the dead. he was nice, tender as he'd been all evening when
recounting tales of kaufman, not petulant and distracted but patient and
kind, i thought, he knows he's going to die soon, that' why he's being so
nice.  then ira cohen? or someone? snapped a photo of us that i would love
to have. just last week i was at the ginsberg archives at stanford looking
for kaufman stuff, and found  some.

in the interest of salvaging the memory of lesser-known poets, here's goes
something that I have been thinking about posting for some time--

I met Chris Ide [1966-1994] when we were first year
students at Michigan State University. After departing our
first class, Barry Gross' freshman english major required
"Intro to the Study of Lit," we went immediately to a
coffeeshop where we had a cup of coffee (my first, although
it seems hard to imagine now) and discussed poetry, punk
rock, and god knows what else. We became instant best-
friends and spent a lot of time together reading, writing,
talking talking talking and also as young boys are wont to
do, drinking and expressing the adolescent ennui of that time
in life. We shared a common background in high school
introductions to poetry and it was, as has been discussed on
this list, the role of the normative-making english teacher
who, as if in some sly signal to a radical past, taught
Ginsberg's poetry as if it were a forbidden text that was only
to be given to truants, drifting creative types, etc. Much of
the ginsberg/beat nexus materials existed in my high school
library, although often edited through torn-out pages. We
found--at a hipster bookstore that was one of the original
Borders client stores--everything that we needed.

Although I first read him in high school, Chris Ide was my
introduction to Ginsberg, whom I was fortunate to have had
the opportunity to speak with on a number of occasions. We
had a number of interactions that were often quite
humourous. I once wrote him an angry letter complaining
that his tour through Portland in 1990 was too expensive for
a poet to attend (it was $15) and that he was becoming a
rockstar/media celebrity and was out of touch with young
poets. I was astonished with one of my housemates handed
me the phone a week later, saying "it's Allen Ginsberg." He
was calling to apologize and offered me free tickets to the
reading! In Boulder, 1991, I cornered him at one point asked
him why he didn't appreciate Oppen's poetry, at which time
he told me that he knew and liked George, but that he never
understood his poetry. This blindness, on Allen's part--his
inability to read beyond a certain canonical set of texts (I
have a copy of an anthology he prepared for a summer
session, "Photographic Poetics" in which cubo-futurists and
other kinds of European avant-garde works are included but
American experimentalists are mostly absent, for obvious
reasons, such as his Steiglitz influenced notion of
photography)--this limitation is really the great problem
with people, like my friend Chris Ide, who become swept up
in the greatness of the man and the greatness of the great
man theory of literature. While as a poet I think I have
learned a great deal from Allen Ginsberg, I have also been
led to things that he would never have approved of--and
Oppen and Zukofsky are examples of this, or the Creeley of
the 70s--etc.  This rejection of Allen was an essential part of
my growth. [and you can get all crazy about that anxiety
game, blah blah blah]

My friend Chris really found a friend in these limited ideas of
what a poet was or what a poem should be or look like.
Also, for Chris, the lifestyle promised in the pages of
Keroac's novels or in some of the surrounding mythologies
was dionysian and ecstatic harmony with love and the muse,
in which people are always young and their bodies as crisp as
the teenager who sleeps for hours as if to rest for the
inevitably of an eternity. Chris found himself at age 18
attracted to boys of that age and younger and as he got older
this became "an impossible love," which as in the Williams
poem, "which has no hope of the world and cannot change
the world to its delight" (I think it is the poem "Rain"?).
Lately, through reading Paul Goodman's writing, I've been
returned to these dilemmas of impossible love which
terrorized Chris.

When Chris died in 1994, he was in recovery from years of
methadone treatment for his addiction to heroin. Even while
on methadone, he relapsed several times. He had been clean
and relapsed. Going immediately to a hospitcal in Chicago,
where he was living, he was treated and released. Scheduled
for a trip to a rehab center outside of the city the next
morning, by agreement he went back to his room in a kind
of home for recovering addicts. On the way, he gave in and
stopped in Wicker Park to buy a bag, which he snorted
when he got back to his room. He had stumbled onto some
"bad stuff" that hit the city at that time, killing a dozen or so
people within a week. A friend, came to get him in the
morning, to go to the clinic. When he didn't respond, his
friend (who happened to be African American) asked the
person at the door to let him into Chris' room to see what
was the matter, alerting the doorperson as to the emergency.
He was told (in effect) that because he was African American
he wouldn't be admitted to check and see. When family
finally intervened and he in his room was found, it was too
late. The coroner reported that Chris spent many hours in a
coma before passing and that in the morning when his friend
to get him, he was probably still alive.

Until yesterday, I held Allen responsible for Chris' death. I
could go into this in some detail, and it involves Ginsberg
sending Chris money at inopportune times, etc. With Allen
being gone, I felt that a bit of Chris was even further from
earth than when he left. Ginsberg was a champion of his
work, which remains unpublished (although underground
beat zines have published a few and I think that Lee
Renaldo's magazine was going to).

I felt and still feel enormous guilt about Chris Ide's death
myself. He saw me as entirely academic, I think, and he
completely misunderstood the passion required to keep it
together in grad school. I don't think he really ever
understood why I felt I needed to deal with school seriously,
and he never really appreciated the kinds of texts I produced,
although I know that he appreciated and loved me. The
poems he wrote are of interest to me in a way that I can't
really describe.

What follows are the first letters that Chris wrote to
Ginsberg in the Fall of 1985 and a couple from the Winter
and Spring of 1986. They are photocopies that Peter
Orlovsky sent to Chris' sister, and I have them on loan from
her. The originals would probably be at Stanford. If anyone
is interested, I will send more back-channel, as they are a
real social document. There are letters and postcards through
Spring of 1993.

Allen,
I'm drunk, have just read the Kaddish and cried. I'm not at
home, found it in someone's bedroom, and after reading I
just had to write. I always cry when I get to the part of you
being 12 yrs old. I'm in love with that Allen Ginsberg, the
one that followed R-- to college. I wish I would've known
you when 12. Could've had love then. Now 18, loveless,
lonely, are you? Did you get last letter? Please write me back
sometime, Allen, I would be touched. God, I'm getting
drunker, refuse to change paragraphs. This letter probably
pathetic, but I'm going to send it anyway tomorrow. Allen I
just read "Many Loves" today for first time and was deeply
affected close to tears in the desensitized library. I think I
love you Allen, don't know how, please don't file me away
as another young poet scribbling bullshit kiss ass note to
you; there's more, sweet Allen. Yes, I hve just read letters
between you & Neal, finished today, depressed, I lay on
couch all day thinking of you. I must talk to you, for real,
someday. Do you remember talking to me in Ann Arbor
after your reading? Talk of dreams of you & of love
strangers. Anyway, I'll mail this drunken note tomorrow to
you c/o Naropa and I beg that you might write back. Oh
god, I am so lonely and sad, in love with the young Allen
Ginsberg whose picture from, say, Jack's book, or young
Empty Mirror photo I long for. Oh same older wiser but
just as Sweet Allen please write to this weak sad young
admirer lover poet, I wait.
                                Love, Chris Ide

Allen--
Maybe you're in Nicaragua now, but I thought i'd take the
time to send these poems off to you. Particularly the one
that begins with a quote of yous (hope you don't mind).
This poem attempts to explain the debt I owe you; how
much you've affected my life so unknowningly, maybe just
by trying to live yous. Anyway, if i'm ever able to express
that debt to you, through my poems, then all of the futile
scribling will have been worth it I spose. Anyway, hope to
see you before "time," before that "final spontaneous leap."
Write if you have a chance.
                another thanx,

Allen,
Happy valentines day! May the ghost of Rimbaud come kiss
you sweetly.
    Can't tank you enough for sending poems to David
Cope-- he liked 'em, wrote back + is printing "cuz I don't
know." You don't know how encouraging that is to me. My
biggest problem is that I don't hae anyone here whose
aesthetics I'm in total agreement with. I have a class w/
Diane Wakoski, who I owe a good deal + trust to an extent
-- but she's an admitted Apollonian + is quite critical of
mentioning the actual composition of a poem, inside the
poem. I've been doing this constantly, and probably always
will to some extent--dunno if I can help it, or if I should try
to. Seems to me if a poem is merely a hunk of a day, it'll pint
a finger at the eternal w/o even trying. Revision is cheap,
but revision of the Truth is downright *sleazy*! Sometimes
I re-weave things and even though it might make for a
better poem, I never feel as good about it. It just that typical
... [words unreadable, end of page].

I dunno-- I just want someone to point a finger + say "You
are a poet!" so I can settle down a bit.
   Enclosed a couple more poems for you to glance at. Sent
more to Cope also. A couple of them I am fairly happy with,
but it always seems to me that there's a whole side of of me
that doesn't come through i.e. the side that is miserable +
falls in love with beautiful unobtainable boys--no otther
sorrow like that!
                                Hope you are well
                                in the east--
                                                Chris

                                       E. Lansing, MICH

Allen,
This another drunk note, but no regrets this time--
whatever's said is meant. No answer to my last letter ('round
valentine's day)--I know, you're busy, but if possible would
you send at least a postcard answering this?
    Appreciate much your giving me Cope's address &
mailing my poems to him--have written quite a few times
w/ him + am visiting him this weekend--a great poet & a
great guy!
    I was supposed to be goign to Paris in August, but
international travel is looking worse & worse, as is most
everything politically, and i'm thinking more & more of
Naropa Summer session. Am writing to them for $ info. but
Cope says I may want to just stay w/whoever I can in
Boulder and pick up on the scene as it happens--what do
you think? This sounds fine to me, but i'd like to be able to
pick up on whatever you're offering--what're you
teaching/lecturing on & would I be able to sit in on things if
not enrolled in session? Basically what i'm asking is will I be
able to see & spend time w/ you--should I enroll or just be
in Boulder, etc. -- whadda you think as you're the main
reason i'd attend?
   Here are a cople more poems, please anser if you've time--
                                        Chris Ide [2]
------------------------------------------------------
                                        5/7/86 10:30 am

Allen,
Thanks for the kind words on the poems I sent--
encouraging to hear! Here are a couple more--don't bother
making specific comments on each when you're
exhausted/busy etc., I just like for you to be able to read
'em. As far as sending stuff to NYZ & Paris Review &
telling them you suggested to--I haven't done so yet, only
because I thought it'd sound like a fishy brag or something--
I mean, I think it's fine for a knowledgeable poet to suggest
the work of a youngster, but when the youngster's the one
to relay the message, I dunno, I can just see editors sniveling
at it. Maybe i'm just being stupid, in which case tell me & i'll
go ahead & seend the poems + suggestion out. As far as
NYQ--i've been rejected twice by them & D. Cope said in
his last letter that he was going to try them for me (after
he'd just succeeded in getting a couple more things in print
for me: _Action_ (you know Jim Cohn, right?) took 2
poems. Just let me know what I should do about sending
that stuff out.
    I'll get together a batch of poems like you said, & will
bring 'em to Boulder this summer--the plan now is to
attend 1st week of classes, then stay a week or so w/ friends-
-(maybe even arrive a week before classes start)--I'll bring
the poems & you can see what you think we can do w/ 'em.
When do *you* arrive & how do I get in touch w/ you?
    Well, all right for now--here's another pic (I hope)--let
me know what to do on sending stuf out etc.--Chris

                                        You off cigareets yet?
I've been slowing way down on drinking, "the old screwy
love,"--when's _White Shroud_ coming out?

------------------------------------------------------
[1] this letter contained poems, including:

"I need a bed to sleep in, a grave to rest my ashes,"
    sings Allen Ginsberg, American Poetry Review December '85
58 years old now, our Whitman
he too will leave behind the earth madly spinning
will take that final spontaneous leap, to where Jack Kerouac
    lies down eith the jazz/blues of the earth
will leave behind those of us whose throats are sore
   from tying to find our voices.
Meanwhile, "Howl" is required reading in English 453
and we discuss the "beat generation" as if it were
   some sort of baseball game
"Did Ginsberg get a hi? Kerouac slide into home?"
In the classroom we liten to a cassette of Ginsberg
        reading "Howl"
no one runs around the room in tears
nothing but blank faces behind desks so that i'm almost
embarrassed
   until the ghost of Jack Kerouac appears rolling around the
   front of the room with a pint of rotgut, laughing.
"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed"
by fear of nuclear devastation
tongues drenched with surrealist budwiser escapism
guts all aflame with the six o'clock news
whose poetry reviews seeped flowery academia--
who'll wear Rimbaud's pants?
   All of you grad school poets
clutching unpublished manuscripts
let's drop out of the New Yorker world series
   and sing in the romantic unpublished streets.

1/23/86
---------------------------------------------------
[2] this letter also contained poems, including:


        What will *you* do with the rest of my life?

I confess that I haven't the urge to work with hand or foot
in order to prove myself to the planet or bank.
Isn't it enough that I vow to beat my chest & yell
for love, an humanity, and all of these four letter words?
It's true my hands are lazy--my heart is not;
I believe that the tree is there to lie beneath;
notice the way the fruit falls without a single plucking finger?
Flat on my back, that'll do,
let the heart slave over the problems of the sky;
the stars are arithmetic enough for me.
But no, each time the grass accomodates me
I wake to the hounds of reality sniffing at my anus.
"I don't see any want ads for poes,
do you wanna be a dishwasher all your life?
Dishwasher/poet, it's not so bad a title,
a drifter, the parents'll say.
But don't they see that they too drift
towards that place where no dishes are washed?
The whole planet adrift in fact--
what a creaky futile barge it becomes
with Reagan clutching silo shaped oars
and you, you have the nerve to ask
"What will you do with the rest of your life?"
I was about to ask you the very same question.

From Ginsberg's elegy for Frank O'Hara:


I want to be there in your garden party in the clouds
                all of us naked
strumming our harps and reading each other    new poetry
        in the boring celestial
                Friendship Committee Museum.
You're in a bad mood?
                Take an aspirin.
                In the dumps?
                        I'm falling asleep
                                safe in your thoughtful arms.

I think it was 1966.  I was home from college and hanging out in Washington
Square Park in NYC.  All of a sudden some people started cheering and
otherwise celebrating, shouting that "The War Is Over."  People around the
park took up the mantra; very soon hundreds of us, with Ginsberg and Corso
in the lead, starting marching up Fifth Avenue.  As we exited the park, cheering
continuously "The War Is Over," people of all kinds, dressed all ways, and of
all ages joined us.  I remember seeing two middle aged guys greeting each other
on the edge of this crazy parade, shaking hands and joining up as they were
laughing out loud, obviously enjoying the wonderful pranksterish seriousness
of the spontaneous occasion, saying to each other in unison, "Hey the war is
over!"  By the time we were approaching 14th Street we were at least a thousand
strong.  The police, for whatever reason, did not try to stop us.  We kept on,
with these two zany poets in the lead, until we got to 42nd Street, now
in the multiple thousands.  There, like two possessed visionary field
marshalls, the two, conferring at the tops of their lungs, decided to split
up, the one leading those who would follow to the United Nations, as a final
destination, the other, Allen, to Times Square.

I followed him.  It was a rainy day, kind of gray, but it was a day of
wildly unfounded, Surreal optimism.  It was a moment of genius, flamboyance,
and lyricism.  It now sums up his poetry for me.  As Charles B has said,
how can one imagine life without Allen?

I always found him incredibly generous.  He (and that day Corso) was a role
model.  I remember talking with him some decades later at a poetry function
at the MOMA.  Our paths had crossed numerous times, but he was someone who
met so many people in so many places, for so long.  If he would recognize
me he didn't go out of his way to show it.  Yet over wine and cheese we talked
at length that night about various things.  He was someone who, it struck me
after that night, never wasted a moment of life.  He was incredibly smart and
interested in EVERYTHING.  And he was incredibly gentle.  I could go on.
I last spoke with him some few years ago at the Orono conference already
mentioned here on this list.  I came up to him to ask him for some work
for Poetry New York.  I allowed as how I might be bugging him, but he
was quick to point out that, no, as an honored guest, that was his job,
to hear me and others like me out.

He understood who he was.  It was I who was still trying to comprehend the
meaning of him.  Yes he has been part of the fabric of my life.

Who will ever read and sing Blake for us again?

I met Ginsberg briefly in an airport van at the end of the Orono poetry
conference; we were wedged up against each other, hardly a space in which to
breathe.  He asked what I'd been speaking on and when I said that I'd given a
talk on Hart Crane he said how much he loved Crane's work.  Then, that he had
his Naropa students read "Atlantis" out loud because the movements of the
mouth while reading that poem were so like those of cock-sucking.  I've never
quite known how to take that remark, though I choose to think of it as
representing the words of a man for whom nothing was shameful.  He had been a
very generous presence at the conference, seemingly in attendance everywhere.

A number of listmembers--Joe Amato, Norman Finkelstein, Cole Swensen, and
I were in the middle of a conference in Denver--a conference on relation
of poetry to theory--when the news came in that Allen had died.  It was
truly heart-breaking.  I thought immediately of the wonderful way Allen
read the lines "To die in Denver...."  from "Howl" and of the last time I
saw Allen, which was appropriately in a California Supermarket--Gelson's
in Pacific Palisades.  I was approaching the deli and there was Allen with
Stan Grinstein, the art patron, with whom Allen was staying for the
Burroughs festival.  We were happy to see each other and wandered around
the gorgeous store and when we got to the bakery Allen said, "Marjorie,
don't tell anyone you saw me in this FANCY grocery store!"  But he was
half-kidding.  It was shortly before his 70th birthday and he was in good
spirits and was having dinner with Dennis Hopper.

It's a nice memory of someone I always found totally endearing--the way he
CARED about his work, your work--everything that was happening...

Subject:      my Ginsberg story

Unlike these other storytellers, I never met Allen Ginsberg, though my  (ex)
father-in-law John Tagliabue was at Columbia with him & is a sort of
Italian-American Maine Shelleyan straight academic double - both of them
from north Jersey (Tagliabue's dad was a chauffeur & restaurant owner
from Cantu, near lake Como - he himself was born there) & some similarities
in their approach to poetry (exuberant, against revision & wasp-anglo
refinement, & WHITMAN & China & buddhism) in fact John Tagliabue is another
of those poets out there.
  anyway, this was early 1970s, I was hitchiking around in a sort of
private-early-Xtian-gnostic daze, having dropped out of college... was in SF.,
had just had my guitar stolen & the back of my head bashed in by a huge
enormous fat Hells'Angel at the stage door of a Dead concert, where I had
gone with my old high school buddies TOM DAVIS & AL FRANKEN of soon-to-be
SNL fame... anyway, I was somewhere in SF & met this young Ginsberg protege
who had just come out there from NY, he was dressed in a buddist toga type thin
g & sandals & carrying a sheaf of poems... told me he loved Ginsberg & followed
him around (I thought...poor Ginsberg) & he was heading up to the bookstore,
so I tagged along... we got to City Lights, which was closed & he started
calling out in this pitiful tone, "Allen...Allen...Allen..." up to the 2nd floo
r window - no response.  After some time I said to him, hey, why don't you
just take these poems and make paper airplanes & THROW them into that window.
So we did.  & we were able to land some right through the 2nd floor window.
My compadre kept moaning out, "Allen...Allen..."  & finally 2 heads popped
out the window - Ginsberg & Ferlinghetti.  They looked at us & smiled for
about a minute, didn't say anything - then went back inside.  My ever-hopeful
poet-pal resumed his mournful calling... so I bid him farewell & headed
on my way.  What else happened in SF?  I played guitar at a healthfood
restaurant & made a few bucks.  A guy in a very large pink cadillac
convertible offered to show me around town, & he did show me Columbus
Park at sunset which was lovely...but he was trying to make me while I
tried to convert him to my version of Xtianity, so we bid each other
farewell... next day I hitched out toward Salt Lake City - that
was my 1st & last visit to the beautiful city of SF where I spoke with
Jerry Garcia, had my head bashed by a NY Hells Angel, goofed around with the
head honchos of the HA Rotary clubs (it was a national convention they were
having there at the Dead concert), met a Ginsberg acolyte, met a denizen
of that fair city, played my other guitar, & caught a glimpse of Allen
Ginsberg.

I thought it might be nice to hear something about Ginsberg from a
younger/new list member, so, here goes:  I met Ginsberg I guess
about two years ago now when he came to read "Kaddish" at Penn,
for the first time in awhile as I understand it.  By a mix-up which left
him without someone to drive him to Penn Towers and his hotel
room, I got a chance to meet him.  Bob Perelman and I took him to
the hotel and Bob had a class to get to so I walked him up.  His
heart condition kept him from carrying his own bags and I think Bob
thought he might drop dead.  There had been some talk about
whether he'd even be able to read that day.  At the hotel counter he
asked for two keys, then held one up at me and said jokingly, "For
some lucky boy later."  It didn't seem directed towards me or, really,
anyone - a kind of nod towards days gone by or a playful attempt to
agitate the guy at the counter.  He seemed, despite the gesture
towards his sexual gamesmenship, a gentle old man.  He was very
kind, asked me whether I was a poet, what kinds of poems I was
writing, who I liked, what my academic work was about, etc, all with
a sense of genuine interest, it seemed to me.  In the elevator we got
into a conversation about Lowell.  He told the story of how Lowell
came to hear him read "Kaddish" at Harvard (1958, '59?).  A third of
the way through the reading Lowell got up and left - Ginsberg
assumed it was a snub and felt bad about it for years, until 1976
when he decided to ask him about it.  They were reading at the 92nd
St. Y and Ginsberg asked Lowell why he'd walked out. Lowell said
he had been sitting in between several Harvard bigwigs who he
knew and had started to cry uncontrollably.  Embarrassed, he got up
quickly and left.  Ginsberg then said he always liked Lowell which
surprised me for a moment, thinking of battles between camps, etc,
but just as quickly made alot a sense, since it didn't seem just then
like this guy standing with me in the elevator could dislike anyone.  I
brought his bags into his room.  He seemed tired and said he better
get some rest.  I thought of having him sign my Collected Poems
which I had in a backpack, but didn't.  I had a weird, morbid feeling
that I might be the last person to see him alive.  Later he read
"Kaddish" very beautifully.  No idea whether this will sound familiar
to anyone but, great poet and poetry aside, I've had a lasting
affection for the guy ever since.

Allen Ginsberg, our great poet and teacher, this saint and holy madman, has
died. I first heard of his illness last week without hearing any details,
and thought, oh, he will still be with us for years yet. Then George Stanley
told me last night that he had been diagnosed with incurable cancer.
Together we discussed the need for Vancouver poets to come together and
write to him in his extremity expressing our undying gratitude and
appreciation for his great life.

This afternoon, I spoke to George Bowering on the telephone to begin this
process, and George told me Allen had died during the night, and now it is
too late. He had been scheduled to read in our city on the very night that
he died, but the engagement was cancelled because of his illness, and now we
will never see him in the flesh again.

He had not visited in our city for many years, and all of us, including a
whole new generation of young people who remain interested  in his work and
vision were looking forward to seeing and hearing him again. The last time
I saw him in the flesh and talked to him was in 1963 at the poets'
conference here. My wife and I and some friends took Allen on the Grouse
Mountain chairlift for an outing.  I the day as one of the most beautiful of
many beautiful days that summer. Allen carried with him a set of  thumb
cymbals, which he beat together prayerfully as the chairlift slowly ascended
the mountain, delivering us an exalted view of the ocean and the city. I am
not at all religious, but Allen was able to inspire in me a sense of the
tremendous beauty of the world and the cosmos, and of human beings which has
never left me.  I don't often speak of the soul, it's something that I
barely understand, but the human soul and its universal quality of love was
always the substance of Allen's discourse, so I am free to do so today, and
I have Allen to thank for this freedom.


The silvery, insistent sound of Allen's cymbals echoed off the tops of the
mountains. The top of my head seemed to open and become part of the sky. The
thundering power of Hare, of Rama, of Krishna, gods I still do not know,
seemed imminent, seemed present. Yet the day remained a perfectly ordinary
day, and all of us were here on earth,  plain beings of human flesh.

The night before at a party at my place, saying he liked the way he danced ,
he had propositioned my friend   Dallas Selman, who was accompanying us that
morning. But Dallas, who was not gay,  put him off by lying, telling him
that his wife wouldn't like it if he went with Allen. In the morning, as we
set out to drive up the mountain, Allen asked Dallas about his wife, and,
stupid me, big mouth, blurted out, "What wife?'  There was plenty of
silliness and laughter surrounding Allen Ginsberg, but he was serious, and
critical, too.  I remember  he made harsh fun of me later for my "hip"
affectations, because that was his way of love. His aim both in his poetry
and his life was to shock and to awaken, and he was so momentously
successful at his work.

The last time I saw him was in Montreal in 1975. Thousands, (literally
thousands!) of Quebecois young people came to see him and William Burroughs
there, and listened with close attention, even though many of them spoke
only French, and they were awakened as they had expected to be, because
Allen never stinted in his the speaking of his truth.

He came to Vancouver again about 1990, when he gave a reading with Gregory
Corso and Michael McClure, I think. But I was living elsewhere and wasn't
able to attend. Gregg Simpson, an artist friend who is also a musician and
lives close by to me, often speaks with great pride about working as the
percussionist in the band that opened the reading. There are many people in
Vancouver whose lives have been touched by his presence in ways they will
never  forget. In the near days to come all of us will be talking together
about Allen and remembering what he gave to us from the unparalleled
generosity of his American soul, from his grand passion.

There are not many poets and poems of which it can be said that they have
changed the direction of human life. Leaves of Grass is certainly one such
poem, and Allen Ginsberg, through the stewardship of his beloved William
Carlos Williams, is the direct inheritor of that wonderful fearless American
public democratic voice. The opening lines of HOWL, that holy poem, cannot
be erased from the consciousness of North America or the world. From the
moment that I first read HOWL, my life was changed forever, and the same is
true of almost all my contemporaries and friends. This sexy apocalyptical
rant was the clearest and steadiest voice of the visions of a
generation.There was a time when I could recite the poem completely off by
heart like the Bible itself. Mad as Ginsberg sometimes like to act, had a
scholar's knowledge of so many things, of the Jewish rabbinical tradition,
of Buddhism, classical and Zen, of Hindu visions, and of Tantric
meditations. He was instrumental in awakening an entire generation of
America to the fact that there were other powerful forms of knowledge that
could enrich the American pragmatic and scientific consciousness and expand
the possibilities of human life. From this mix, Ginsberg concocted a stew
both flavourful and spicy. And full of a delightful laughter.  He never went
passive in the world, he was always striving to make an effect, to wring
some changes, and even when at his most clown-like, playing, the fool,
beneath it and under it all was a deep and important human dignity which
commanded respect, but especially love.

Official America laughs and makes a joke of this holy fool, but he, in his
person and in his work,  represents the new soul of the New America which is
still being born. For many years he mainly disappeared from the public
media, but recently I have seen on television a wonderful documentary about
the life and work of William Carlos Williams, in which Allen gives a wise
and beautiful analysis and summation of the contradictions within  the
American society and psyche which were expressed by Allen's great teacher,
the hope and the  desire for a richer and more humane human life, thwarted
by the blindness of official morals and society in America--

"The pure products of America/go crazy."

"I have seen the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness."

With these and the lines that followed, Ginsberg fashioned a call and a
program for a kind of mental and social insurrection which is still going on
in America, and there is no going back. Once said, this cannot be cancelled,
and the message will be heard by this generation, and the next generation,
and the next. Allen cannot die. He has already joined the Immortals.

Then again, during the Gulf War, Allen Ginsberg appeared on television, the
only one among thousands of Americans who gave their views during those
horrifying traumatic months, to speak unequivocally and clearly in the voice
of an Old Testament prophet, with the learning of a rabbi, and the deep
understanding of the American democratic political tradition, condemning the
holocaust visited on the Iraqi people by the merciless bombs of American
military power, so unjustifiably, so contrary to the purest  ideals of
American democracy. It was the speech of a hero, an act of the purest human
courage and made me proud that I had once stood in the living presence of
this wonderful American human being. That one speech erased forever my
skeptical doubts about the power of the truth that Allen Ginsberg carried in
his soul and daily spoke, the mightiness of that "queer shoulder" he vowed
so many years ago to put to the wheel  in hiis poem called "America,"
tough, unbending speaker of human love that he was.

These two television programs and anything else that he has done, should be
made available to the world as we think back upon the life of this great
poet and the profound knowledge he has given us of America and its soul.

It was through Allen Ginsberg and his friends that I came to know so many
things  I would otherwise have never known. Today, I know  I am together
with poets in my own country and in the United States, England, The Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Cuba, India, Mexico, Japan--all the places in
the world that his monumental love has touched. Allen was instrumental in
bringing to the consciousness of ignorant North Americans, the beauty and
wisdom of the religious texts of the East, including the Tibetan Book of the
Dead. Now Allen is receiving the emanations of all our love assisting his
soul in its passage to that other world.

Dearest, beloved Allen, I am not alone in loving you: there are thousands
world wide who are thinking about you today with love and gratitude. People
everywhere are sending you their blessings as you pass into the spirit. All
of our shoulders are still at the wheel, still at the work which you showed
us must be done, and how to do it, given the example of your own magnificent
courage and devotion, the splendour of your awakened human vision.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

   I will backchannel to Jamie my appreciation also, but I want to thank
him on the list for his splendid eulogy forwarded to us today. Reading it,
I thought of all that AG survived in order to flesh out his
three-score-and-ten, while not only keeping his mind but growing in
humanity, and I thought of how infectious his spirit, finding as I did a
scale and tone in Jamie's eulogy I had too little appreciated, in these
many years of our separation, were part of this man's range, but which
surely owed something to the topic of his address.

   By way of postscript to Jamie's posting and those many of others, I'd
like to say my Ginsberg piece. While AG and I met several times over the
decades, I did not become close with him until we were neighbors in the
faculty dorms at Naropa. During those conversations I learned about him
firsthand what everyone has been speaking to the list--most notably, of his
breadth, humility, and unremitting hunt for the intelligent heart of the
world.  Through his position and stature as a world leader, he bore the
continual brunt of exponential information and once I had to ask him to put
aside what he knew of injustice and misery from all over, so that we might
feel happier while we talked. Scrupulously obliging, as one hears he so
often could be, he did what he could to shut out what must have been a
virtually uninterruptible clamor for succor and witness beaming in to his
radio-brain.

   Where AG was concerned, it was not love at first sight for me (the first
time we met, in Vancouver in 63, he was wearing white robes and would have
preferred to bow, I guess, but reluctantly did shake my hand, saying "Oh,
are we still doing that?" : one might have said the same to him!) but at
Naropa I found myself on his wavelength, an unforgettable experience.(For
which opportunity, which this once I was not so dumb as to reject, my
thanks to Anselm Hollo, Anne Waldman, Andrew Schelling and the other Naropa
lights.)

   He and I spoke of his health problems, and he complained of being tired,
but he gave off a spry resilience that assured one he was good for a long
time yet. That was only 18 months ago. But we see what life he continues to
have as anecdote and eulogy flood in; and it was never clearer that he
belongs to the ages.

Sorry for the length--meant to keep it short but something about Allen can
take one over I notice. And thanks again to Jamie for his inspiring words.

Once I was at a gathering in Buffalo, having driven Tom Raworth there
from Rochester. Susan Howe was there, too, and Allen Ginsburg and
several Buffalodians who are on this list. Somehow along the drive I had
developed one of those really nasty neck-ache / sinus headache pains and
wasn't able to talk with anyone. I was sitting apart, resting my neck,
when I felt hands on my shoulders. It was Allen, concerned about someone
he never even met. We exchanged a few words, I thanked him for writing
honestly and told him he was an inspiration to me. We talked a little
politics. Since then whenever some self-appointed literary didact has
tried to make pronouncements about Ginsberg's personality, I have
argued. Here was a man who did not give himself airs. He tried his best
to live honestly in this crazy world.

Actually SOME of us, who are stretched rather thin, are not at all happy
about the "loss" of a "formerly extra" hour of sleep....What exactly do
business interests get out of it by the way?

Last summer Paul Hoover and I were teaching at Naropa the week they
happened to hold a belated birthday party for Allen. The tone of the
toasts at the party was respectful but in summary of his career and I
thought a bit tedious to someone who wasn't well (he'd been very ill the
week before) and who seemed impatient with direct praise.  After he was
presented his dietetic cake and asked to say some words, these were the
words he said:  "This is boring and embarrassing."  Candor and
practicality were among his strongest attributes, and he didn't forsake
them for birthday pomposity.  After he was allowed offstage, he became
personally very pleasant amd talked to everyone in sight. I felt lucky to
attend his less than successful birthday celebration and, like all people
on this list, will miss him.

I read yesterday's log this morning with the expectation that someone
would've commented already on the NYT obituary.  But no one has.  I
didn't expect the Times to get it right, but still--

Wilborn Hampton adds an exclamation point to the title _Howl_ (even though
the front page photo has the Facsimile Edition right there, no exclamation
point).  (A photo on page 21 almost certainly misidentifies someone else
as William Burroughs.)  Hampton quotes John Leonard (of all people) and
Saul Bellow (of all people) on AG's significance as a writer.  He
describes AG as "a protege of William Carlos Williams."  He says that AG
"used the celebrity he gained with 'Howl!' to travel widely during the
next two decades"  (living off his fame, sure).  He misspells John Clellon
Holmes' name and seems confused about the circumstances concerning _Howl_
and WBAI.  The obit seems generally disdainful: "[Ginsberg] declared he
had found a new method of poetry.  'All you have to do,' he said, ' is
think of anything that comes into your head," etc.  And Neal Cassady is
identified as "a railway worker who had literary aspirations."  The
headlines--"Master of Beat Poets" and "Master of the Outrageous" also seem
to cast AG as someone not to be taken (all that) seriously.

Now I know the work of three Hamptons.  I still prefer Lionel and Hawes.
(But what did I expect for four dollars?)

always ready to defend the status quo... just a few comments on Michael
Leddy's comments.

the obit could have been better, granted.  But it was a far cry from
generally disdainful. Why NOT quote laudatory remarks from figures outside
of the circle of admirers (i.e. Saul Bellow)?  That seems the most objective
kind of praise.  The photo mentioned certainly WAS Burroughs.  Would
Ginsberg himself want to be taken ALL THAT SERIOUSLY?  Do you want to have
it both ways?  I thought for a brief time AG WAS a "protege" of Williams -
before going to college.  I could have this wrong.  People know AG 's
letter turns up (amazingly!!) in _Paterson_ - not the letter of a disciple,
for sure - in fact a critical letter, critical of some myopic aspects of
Wms' epic - but it's still the letter of a young writer in dialogue with
an older.  but hey, let's not have a hash-over debate over the tombs...
love, love, & sorrow these days, & joy too yoo too - Henry G

Richard Howard relates (in _Alone With America_, that most parochial of
books masquerading as a universal history) how Ginsberg once stood before
the assemblage at a literary conference in the 60's and humbly, piously,
decently stripped naked - as naked as the self he revealed (and created) in
his poems.

Whenever I think of Allen Ginsberg I think of that: a theatricality that
transcended itself through sheer openess and sweetness.

I think of the  line from Ruben Dario:

"From its own nakedness does the star shine."

I spent a chunk of an afternoon speaking to a reporter from the Newark
Star-Ledger talking about Allen (I did an anthology of NJ poets a few years
back and I seem to be on every reporter's rolodexs). This beatnik/sex
revolutionary/guru stuff seems to be the inevitable way the press sees the
story. I hope this is not what he'll be remembered for.

I was his student at Naropa in '81 & was friends with him over the last
years and was always amazed at his generosity and kindness despite the
enormous demands many people put on him. He would tell me at naropa that he
wanted to retire and go off to a mountain colorado  towrite in peace, but
there was another part of him that wanted to be out there. He was much like
Sartre -- who used his fame as a way for advocating for his causes and
friends. Where would American poetry be now if it where not for Allen's
push in the 50's? Although Allen's inability to "get" poets outside his
sphere was a source of some humor and consternation at Naropa, Allen did
try hard to understand poets like Clark Coolidge and Ron Silliman. As
Rexroth once said, he was a radical conservative who made his breakthrough
by bringing back the cadences of the Hebrew Bible and Walt Whitman.

I must say that I hadn't looked at his work seriously in a number of years.
Reviewing the collected, I'm struck by his innovative short lyrics and his
use of numerous forms and that his work kept shifting and changing over the
years. He was one of the most self-critical of major poets. I once asked
him why he rarely read from Reality Sandwiches. He said: "Oh, I just don't
think those poems are that good." The best reading I ever heard him do was
in the early 80's at the old Brentanno's Books on 8th St. The reading was
undepublicized and the audience was mostly st marks poets. Without
harmonium or finger cymbals, etc., he stated "I want to read some new
poems" and did just that, in quiet (for Allen) voice

I don't think we'l see another literary figure with as much influence as
Allen had. He was the first living poet I was aware of (age 11 -- those
evergreen review posters w/ allen as uncle sam) . It's hard to imagine him
not around

On a more serious note, we=92re going to be including a new feature with=20
your weekly film notes: when possible, we=92ll provide you with web links=
=20
to sites containing meaningful background information on a given week=92s=

government=92s Inuit website for great historical and cultural data, and=20
then visit Marc London=92s Inuit art site for examples of indigenous art=20
and sculpture.

And please note that our May 8 show with John Barnes in person will=20
begin at 7 pm --- one half-hour earlier than usual --- to allow adequate=20
time for two hours of film plus your opportunity to ask questions during=20
our live interview with this legendary filmmaker.

Jose,  Thursday at 7:30 pm=20

Web sites of interest:

(Canadian Inuit site) =20
http://www.inac.gc.ca/pubs/information/info16.html
(Inuit sculpture & art)   http://www.total.net/~elcalon/

The Inuit are a nomadic aboriginal group from northeastern Canada=20
comprising some 600 bands speaking derivations of the Inuktitut=20
language.  In 1999, the territory of Nunavut will be spun off from the=20
Northwest Territories, and provide more formal representation for the=20
Inuit in the new bi-cultural  government residing in the town of=20
Iqaluit, formerly know as Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island.  The Inuit have=20
been the subject of many dramatic and fascinating films, and tonight=20
we'll show three of the best.  In addition to providing wonderful=20
insight into a little-understood population, these understated films=20
provide a tonic for those of us who have gotten sick and tired of having=20
to listen to new age music and panpipes as musical accompaniment for=20
seemingly every documentary, ethnographic, or zoological film be=20
produced today.

=91At the Winter Sea Ice Camp I=92
=91At the Autumn River Camp II=92, both 1969, d. Quentin Brown.   In the=20
late 1960's anthropologist Asen Balikci attempted to document=20
traditional customs, including seal hunting and komatiq (dog-sled)=20
making, as they were before the coming of the missionaries and the use=20
of rifles, usually dated at 1919 or so.  When these films were made,=20
there were still Inuit who remembered how to do these things, and=20
Balikci and director Quentin Brown made total of nine films.  Our two=20
favorites are the savage 'At the Winter Sea Ice Camp I' and 'At the=20
Autumn River Camp II', both outstanding documents in the non-narrated=20
ethnographic tradition, and filmed at minus 10 degrees F.   Among other=20
things, the Inuit make a sled out of fish and antlers, and successfully=20
hunt seal living six feet under sea ice.

=91Land of the Long Day' (1952), d. Doug Wilkinson.  Paradoxically=20
preceding the former films by 17 years, the director shows Inuit customs=20
as they really were in the early 50's.  Idlouk, the protagonist,=20
tragically terminated his own life several years after 'Land' was made.=20
 This film is not only a fine explanation of the challenges faced by the=20
Inuit, it is also a tribute to the filmmaker working in adverse=20
conditions in which cameras freeze and weather is unpredictable.=20


Future programs include:

April 17: =91Trans-Europ Express=92: the 'cine'-roman' of Alain=20
Robbe-Grillet.  Rarely do we show feature length films, but tonight is=20
an exception, as the entire program is given to the experimental=20
filmmaker Alain Robbe-Grillet's 'Trans-Europ Express' (1965).  This=20
outstanding work is a film within a film as Robbe-Grillet sits in a=20
train car and discusses with his producer and script supervisor a film=20
he'd like to make about a drug deal in Antwerp.  A man in fake beard and=20
glasses gets on the train, but the director states he'd rather have J-L=20
Trintignant, who then materializes, and stars, along with Marie-France=20
Pisier, in this fascinating, unusual film in which characters and=20
authors cross each other's paths, yet stay in their own frames of=20
reference.  Robbe-Grillet scholar John Leo will present a ten minute=20
introduction to the work of this outstanding writer and filmmaker.=20

John hosts a Robbe-Grillet site; please visit it for more info:

http://www.halfaya.org/robbegrillet/


April 24:  Judith Bronowski=92s Mexico --- This filmmaker made four=20
outstanding films showcasing historically significant artisans of=20
Mexico.  Made in the mid-1970s, they document the work --- and the words=20
of the artists.  Tonight we=92ll show three of them:  =91Pedro Linares=92=
=20
(papier-mache=92 monsters called =91alebrijes=92), =91Manuel Jimenez=92=20
(woodcarver from Oaxaca), and =91Sabina Sanchez=92, an embroidered from=20
Oaxaca.  =91Linares=92, incidentally, was shown at =91cine16=92 earlier thi=
s=20
year, and is returning by request.  We=92ll have one more short on this=20
program, which we=92re hoping will be the fourth in the series, lent by=20
the filmmaker.

May 1:     To be announced.

May 8: SHOW STARTS AT 7 PM.  'Shaw vs. Shakespeare' A tribute to the=20
masterwork of director John Barnes.   After reading the complete works=20
of George Bernard Shaw, Barnes wrote, directed, and produced a series of=20
three films narrated by Shaw (brilliantly portrayed by Donald Moffatt),=20
describing how parallel characters (e.g. Julius Caesar, played by=20
Richard Kiley) are treated differently by the two playwrights.  We feel=20
this series is one of the highlights of educational cinema: engaging,=20
thoughtful, and intellectually stimulating.  This is a rare opportunity=20
to see these three 1/2 films, produced in 1970, presented consecutively.

Also shown: 'Portable Phonograph', Barnes' last film, and one of the=20
best.


WHO ARE WE?=20
=20
'cine16'  is a once-per-week, Thursdays at 7:30 pm cinema focusing on=20
the historical and thematic aspects of 16mm documentary, ethnographic,=20
industrial, and art films.   Shows are approximately two hours long, and=20
admission is always free.  All shows start at 7:30 pm, but arrive early=20
for seating.  We're in the cellar speakeasy at downtown San Jose's=20

Hello,

Could someone please tell me where the idea/notion/line "technician of the
sacred" comes from? I know it is the title of one of Jerome Rothenberg's
anthologies and is quoted in the commentary on Blake in Poems for the
Millennium,but I'm looking for the original source.

The source is Eliade's great book, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of
Ecstasy, although I can't recall that he uses the phrase exactly in that
way.  Rather he speaks of shamans mastering techniques of the sacred,
which does of course (or did for me) suggest the other phrase.  The
excitement in Eliade was that the shamans, as presented therein, were
also masters & makers & manipulators of language in such a way as
to suggest that we could think of them as proto-poets, & then ...
        But it was always more complicated than that -- & mysterious --
& that was what the excitement was about ...

I don't recall the phrase -- or anything like it -- turning up elsewhere.
But then, who knows?

With all good wishes,

I'm looking forward to reading, & watching the show too.  Was struck by
a Ginsberg quote in the paper (or was it on the list?) - "You don't need
to be right, just candid." (this may not be exact).  It reminded me of
a mysterious statement Mandelstam made when asked something like, "what
is poetry".  He said - "Poetry is the poet's sense of being right."

Actually the press, reinvented by Stan Bevington, Victor Coleman and Rik
Simon, old hands at the original Coach House Press, is called Coach House
Books now, for legal reasons. Their books are done both on the Net
(beautifully---Coach House was the inventor of anything done with computers
in book publishing way back) and in artifact form, also beautifully. You
can get at their home page via search. Ask for something like Coach House
Books.

Subject:      denver conference etc...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

fresh back from denver, to hundreds of messages... some incredibly touching
commentary on allen ginsberg, much appreciated by this list member... being
in denver, hearing the news of his death (from marjorie) was, well...

"reconcilable (in) differences:  the marriage of writers and critics" was a
small, friendly conference---i regret, esp. b/c it was small, not having
had the occasion to speak more with norman f. and others... seeing marjorie
again, meeting chris alexander and linda russo of this list region, and
elizabeth franken (not from this list region, but from here in chicago),
among the highlights of my time there... and of course seeing the
mountains---which i so dearly miss, living now in flatland... perhaps the
friendliness of the conference stemmed from it having been put together, in
large part, by grad students at du...

gerald graff's keynote, "teaching the conflicts between creators and
theorists," didn't do much for me... i tried to indicate the problems i had
with graff's presentation, but unfortunately my hand was not called upon...
not least of such problems being that he made no mention at all of the
possibilities of *this* medium for crossing institutional boundaries, for
consolidating support among different levels of the academic hierarchy...
graff himself struck me as, well, a nice guy... but i'm not sure that he
really had all that much to add to the creative-critical split (he was by
his own account a bit tentative about his talk), albeit i respect his
attempt at least to deal with the classroom, with teaching as such... i
left his talk wishing he'd spent a bit more time online---seems to me he
hasn't, though maybe i'm mistaken... ensuing discussion, provoked in part
by marjorie, seemed to surface graff's decision not to discuss specifically
literary formations... for my part, i would have mentioned that the
academic scene is now entirely disrupted and fractured by job market
considerations, that good work is being done in spite of this fact, but
that we need to develop alternative structures for negotiating our
conflicts and woes...

marjorie's paper, imnsho, was apropos to the conference itself, sifting
through the poetic-publishing-cultural implications of kent johnson's
probably aka araki yasusada's poetry... marjorie's was a lesson in
scholarly thoroughness and insight---not to mention her performance, which
was utterly enjoyable... ensuing discussion raised the issue of identity
politics and how it functioned in marjorie's paper---a discussion that
might be picked up here upon the paper's forthcoming publication (in _the
boston review_---right marjorie?)...

as to panels:  i very much enjoyed carole maso's reading, and laura
mullen's reading... otherwise, i was taken by susannah breslin and lily
james talk on "postfeminist cyborgs"... these two women have set up a web
site, the postfeminist playground, that looks to be provocative and useful:
<http://www.pfplayground.com>... there were of course a few papers that
seemed to exploit "can poetry matter" issues (yes, but it must be "real")
in the expected ways... not much to say here that hasn't already been
said...

as to the "featured" reading, i was struck by poet and alum heather
mchugh's capacity for 'reading'  her audience (to borrow from my wife kass
fleisher, who was also in attendance)... heather came across as a warm and
genuine person of real integrity... her work is certainly more traditional,
but her performance, her narrative ruminations as such seemed to me to be
very much a part of her reading that evening...

kass and i played hookie on sunday (no apologies!) and drove up to lookout
mountain, a short jaunt from denver... neither of us had ever visited the
buffalo bill museum... it was fun, if a bit hokey, and the view from the
top of the mountain, covered in a crystalline white blanket, was
invigorating...

in all, i'm not certain whether any critics and writers actually reconciled
their differences as a result of this conference, but i DO see the
conference itself as symptomatic of, hence contributing to, a general
awareness that the writerly and the critical are more complex constructions
than might at one time have been generally acknowledged... perhaps this
itself signals a willingness to talk, accompanied by the demise of certain
categorical quibbles, among specific subsets of (largely academic)
writers/critics... if power-laden structures are not so easily dismantled,
there is nonetheless great value to getting together... the conference
organizers evidently (wisely) will put together a listserv to discuss some
of the issues that were raised at the conference... stupid me, i forgot to
drop off my email address (!)... if any of you 'out there' have info. on
the listserv, please post me backchannel... or maybe here is more
appropriate...

in all, i/we had fun... the one structural problem with the conference was
that panel sessions were staged with no 'in between' time, back-to-back...
three panels ended at ten o'clock and three more began at ten-o'clock,
meaning you had to skip out on panels if you wished to shoot the shit
(which i did)... in any case, i judge conferences by their ability to
nurture new and existing networks, and in such terms, the conference was a
success...

best,

joe

I am in love with Language,
Mouthing's all I have
That inherently forms of Gauge
A measure of Soul or Salve

The shadowless Norm or Verb
Spatters the Landscape of motion
Where Drives inscribe the Kerb
Of Name and Revelation

Describing further creates
A Bind of Attributes
Transformed by Men and Fates
Inscribed through Institutes

Let Nothing hurtle towards
Hurdles across the Sound
Constrained by mouthed Retorts
Quicksand beneath the Ground

Let Nothing gyre and turn
Across the Platitudes
Whole Worlds on fire burn
In wayward Latitudes

Mouthing's Telos cries
And Clara constitutes
Ships and countermands
Inscribing Institutes

And Clara constitutes
Black Freighters, real Beauts

 All propaganda has to be popular and Ins to adapt its spiritual level to
the
perception of the least intelligent of those towards whom it intends to
direct itself.
--Adolf Hider, Mein Kampf (1933)

In its late March 1997 Broadcast of the CBS News Magazine, "48 Hours,"
the
network hit a deadly and diabolical low with its piece 'on the Christian
Community in Woodcrest, NY known as the Bruderhof (German for place, or
home,
of Brothers).

Using slick editing techniques, half-lies, and most damaging,
juxtaposition
with other unrelated stories, "48 Hour" projected the unmistakable and
dangerous assertion that the Bruderhof is a cult.  This projection took
place
in a particularly insidious in the same program that featured an opening
segment on the mass suicide of 39 members of a group calling itself
"Heaven's
Gate," in a place called Rancho Santa Fe, California.

"Heaven's Gate," which saw itself as millenialist, and inheritors of a
new
evolutionary entity; perceived their human bodies as encumbrances, as
burdens
that had to be shed, and when the Hale - Bopp comet came near, they saw
it as
a sign to "shed their flesh containers." To say the very least, Heaven's
Gate-seekers were folks who were immensely alienated from their bodies
(according to press accounts the males were Voluntarily castrated), and
neither contacted, nor created, families.

Taking the quasi-similarities that Heaven's Graters were mostly white,
well
educated, computer-savvy and remote from general society' and that the
Bruderhof shared similar attributes, "48 Hours" launched into a "guilt by
similarity,' program, and in the minds of millions created the dangerous
notion that those mere similarities amounted to equivalencies arid
therefore,
one's a cult, so the other must be also.

How can a community of thousands of fathers, mothers, farmers and
carpenters,
who heartily embrace the sacredness of all life, be so cavalierly equated
with a little-known, virtually asexual group of 39 people like "Heaven's
Gate?"

The smart answer, of course, is that a powerful entity like CBS can do it
because they can. They are the media, and they do what they want to do
daily.

So the question becomes, 'Why?"

The answer is the Bruderhof's most recent efforts on behalf of life,
justice
and freedom, most notably on behalf of the writer, and his spiritual
family,
the revolutionary MOVE organization. It lies in their efforts against the
U.S. Death Penalty. It lies in their efforts to practice a Christianity
that
seeks social justice and is unabashedly critical of white supremacy. It
lies
in their expression of community.

Why then would a show scheduled for April, one which was taped months
ago,
be rushed on the air opposite the "Heaven's Gate" suicides?

Part of it is the unerring lust for the sensational that is at the heart
of
American media, and much is the interests they represent -- that of the
established: the State.

The doyen of CBS News, Edward R. Murrow once noted, "Unless we get off
our
fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to
distract, delude, amuse and insulate us, then television and those who
finance
it, those who look at it and those who work at it, may see a totally
different picture too late."

Well, Ed, your colleagues at your old network (CBS) may now intone, "too
late," for they have fired an unfair broadside at a group, labeled them
without just cause a "cult" that "bears close scrutiny", and endangered
them
by aligning them with a group that they hold virtually nothing of value
in
common.

For; by utilizing one word, "cult", and putting them in the programmed
context of the Heaven's Gaters, they project them in the public mind as
other, weird, and dangerous, if not suicidal.

In America, as MOVE's example nakedly reflects, people projected as Other
can
be treated far differently (and even negatively) than so-called "normal"
folks.

With the arrogance of the media's power of projection, "48 Hours"
suggests
the Bruderhof held a young woman as a virtual prisoner, neglecting to
inform
viewers that their youngsters go to high schools and colleges on the
outside
(even around the world) every day.

Does that sound like hostages?

Americans are widely and justly suspicious and distrustful of the
nation's
mass media.  They view it as a tool of the wealthy and the, a protector
of
the status qno. and a fermenter of unjustified fear.

CBS did nothing to dissuade them of that view.

For those in the South Bay area or even north of it!

Maeera Schreiber and Susan Dunn (both on this List) and I are sponsoring,
with the help of eager undergrads, a Memorial for Allen this Friday (11th)
at noon at White Plaza (between bookstore and Tressider Union--great
outdoor space).  We plan to have anyone who cares to read a favorite
Ginsberg poem or say whatever s/he has to say.

If you are coming from outside the campus (drive #280 to Alpine, right on
Alpine to Junipero Serra, right on Junipero Serra to Campus Drive
East--left on Campus drive into the campus; left on Mayfield to big
parking lot from which you can almost see and probably hear activity in
White Plaza).  If you want to read, please call Ranita at the English
Dept, 415-723-2635--so she can put your name on the sign-up sheet we have.

It will be quite informal but we did want to do something.

Best wishes,
Marjorie Perloff

  WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A large storm on the sun's surface probably will hit
the earth's magnetic field Wednesday with the potential to disrupt
communications satellites and power grids, NASA said.

    ``It's clearly a big event,'' said Don Savage, a spokesman for NASA's
Office of Space Science. A large solar flare was blamed for the destruction
of a broadcast satellite in January.

    Savage said matter blown off the face of the sun -- essentially a stream
of ionized particles -- was expected to strike a ``glancing blow'' to the
magnetic field that shields the Earth more than 100 miles from its surface.

    He said those who operate sensitive satellites and power grids had been
warned to take unspecified steps to safeguard their operations through an
established early-warning system that reports ``space weather.''

    The solar storm was detected a couple of days ago by the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory, a satellite that NASA and the European Space Agency
launched in 1995 to keep a constant eye on the sun's surface.

    Savage said scientists still were calculating the precise arrival time of
the solar impact, which was likely to produce a shimmering curtain of
multi-colored light called an aurora over the North and South poles.

thanks maz, i love this kind of info-thing; i feel compelled to ask the
rhetorical question, though: why is this kind of info welcomed, along w/
silly jokes etc, on the poetix list, but when someone wants to talk about
pound's or someone else's politics we're scolded that it "has nothing to do
with poetix?"  seems to me there's some very specific fears afoot that have
nothing (and, of course, everything) to do with poetry.

For those of you in the Pacific Northwest, check out this week's lit
section of Seattle's free weekly The Stranger--it contains articles by both
db (on fountain pens) and kk (on John Wieners)--and lots of other
interesting sounding stuff.  Books editor Matthew Stadler is taking this
lit section into new dimensions--i.e., the 90s.

Sorry, for posting this to the entire list, but didn't know how else
to get a message to maria d.

Maria --
I don't know if you remember, but a few months ago I sent you a paper
about Aime Cesaire that I had presented at a conference in Minneapolis.
  I was wondering if you'd received the paper, if
you'd had time to read it, and if you found it at all interesting.
I'm in a bit of a literary limbo right now, living in Nebraska, and
relish any kind of intellectual stimulation I can gather.

I'll be moving to Buffalo in May to start my PhD program in English in
the fall.  While i'm in e-limbo, i can be reached at the following
address:

racerx1@aol.com

Thanks for your time.

maria,

people here at sfu (save for a guy named george bowering, or is it george
bowering) really dump on eliot. perhaps it's because there's a philosophical
demon in works that are modern, and we have to know abt it, and not just
post-modern it out of existence.

that's where you email your reply to just an individual, rather than

of a personal nature, or otherwise not likely to be of interest to the

Call me bemused, but this representation seems a little self-serving,
Maria. Anytime you want to talk about anything, you're welcomed here,
as far as I have seen. As far as addessing Dorn's or Pound's or my or
your or anybody else's politics--i.e. their work--hooray and hooray.
In so far as I, or others, have seemed to scold, it's been when the
conversation degenerated into who heard whom say what at the head of a
table at some banquet I was never at, and on the basis of which we're
all supposed to get together and punch people out. Where I come from
there's names for that, but none of them are _political discourse_.
The problem for me is that some people seem to be implying that we
shouldn't even read certain texts because of moralisitic
imputations about the author's character. You want to talk about
politics in The Cantos, or politics in Gunslinger or Tales of Gran
Apacheria, hey, let's go. Any time.

(Full disclosure:  This was a reading to celebrate the publication of my
magazine, _Antenym_)

"Greatest reading EVER" some said--no, wait, that was what I was dreaming
some said before I woke up Saturday morning.

You couldn't have asked for more perfect weather (in San Francisco, anyway)
to send the literati out blinking into the sunlight to hear live poetry
outdoors.  Everyone seemed to find the clearing in the Redwood Grove
without getting lost in the wilder regions of the park, and we got started
at about 1:30.  Chris Daniels was so excited he almost started before I had
a chance to introduce him, but relented and let me tell the audience he was
about to read.  He read translations he did from the Portugese of Max
Martins and Fernando Pessoa under a few of his heteronyms.  The birds
chirped at his every word.

Next up was Elizabeth Robinson, who, like me, is in the process of moving.
For Elizabeth, this meant she had no final versions of any poems, except
the ones in _Antenym 12_.  So she read those, plus several draft versions
of other poems--these were all from her "EAR" series of poems whose titles
and end-rhymes she cut from Edwin Arlington Robinson poems and rewrote the
rest of the bodies of.  The grass grew at her every word.

After the hat passing (thanks to Pat Reed for the hat) Darin DeStefano gave
a strong, emotional reading prefaced by the story of an experience he had
in this spot in the park involving a friend, a flock of blue jays, a piece
of glass, and his guilt feelings at being human in a world of nature.  He
finished with a beautiful, freshly-written poem with stars and dogs in it,
and then, for an encore, performed another new piece with John McNally (on
the last day of his visit from New Jersey).  "Treason!  Treason!" they
shouted.  The redwoods released perfume to censer their every word.

Present aside from Mother Nature and the abovementioned were Benjamin
Hollander and his two lovely children, Eric Selland, Mary Sullivan-Roark,
Laurel Beymer, Kristin Burkart, Miranda, and George Albon.

I was going to refrain from sharing my Ginsburg story,
as it is wednesday already -- but I'm appreciating &
enjoying & admiring the pileup  -- accrued while I was at the
DU conference -- which I am just now in the thick of.

& since i shared a stage with AG -- here goes:
about 5 years he read at the Boston Public
Library -- I was one of the last to slip through
the door & was being graciously ordered to leave by
institutional security musclemen because there were
no seats & i was refusing to leave because i was just
this one body -- how could i break a fire code?
-- the floor in the auditorium does not count as a seat --
I could join the others upstairs and watch him
televised! --There were, however, a few unoccupied seats
on the stage & AG invited me to take one.  I was psyched
of course at the time, i had the best seat in the house --
but it wasn't until reading what listservefolks have to say that
I realize very few *famous* people would've done that --
would've even thought to do that. -- l.

joe et. al.--
guess you (joe) got back a lot faster than we did,
thanks to "inclimate weather" ["oxymoronic"]
in wyoming. ended up stuck in some motel
room in cheyenne sunday night that smelled
like "air freshener", otherwise known as
"carcinogens" ["not as catchy but"]. we both
missed work mundane but made it home in one
piece despite h3eavy winds & the fact that we
were driving a volkswagon.

all of which is preparation for saying that since
you beat us to the punch er post, & because I'm
terribly lazy, I'll just respond. "words fail me", or
vice versa.

I was a bit more impressed with graff's presentation,
though I, too, was dissatisfied to see the adjunctification
issue, which should be foremost in our minds, remain at
the margins. it does seem that this problem has everything
to do with conflict both within & between departments, yet
it only came up, in the presentation & the following discussion,
obliquely, specifically in reference to the question of a "level
playing field", so to speak, i.e., would adjunct faculty dare
to dispute tenured profs etc. it's not that the question of
institutional power isn't important, particularly with regard
to an orientation toward inter-/intra-departmental conflict,
but the power question might profitably lead us to other
questions, such as why are we allowing this to happen &
what are others of us doing about it & what are we going to
do about it & when?

but graff's emphasis on conflict, if not new to me & probably
many others in the audience [at times I felt "preaching to the
converted"], is still well-taken. coming as I have through two
departments where the rift between scholars, critics, & "creative"
writers was/is absolute--& here it might be appropriate to say that
where I found marjorie's examples hopeful to say the least, I
also consider them exceptional in the extreme--I still think graff's
model a very useful one, certainly worth articulating. as far as
*this* medium & it's apparent value in facilitating dialogue
between the parties in question,--I'll have to consider it. my
first reaction is to say that this list plays out its own conflicts,
some of them very serious & very important to me, but none
quite identical to the institutional discourse graff is looking for.
then again, I can think of conversations here that partake of just
these problems, as for example Artists Versus Cultural Studies
which we had not too long ago & which was pretty good actually.

marjorie's paper was exemplary & a real pleasure. I look forward
to its publication, which is sure to provoke response on the list, &
I look forward to that response. beyond my usual fascination with
spurious texts, I have to say that the yasusada work strikes me as
a wonderful example of humor in the service of critique--a
beautiful time bomb which I'd actually love to teach at some point.

apropos of which, I thought bin ramke gave a very good paper
on the literary hoax & contemporary notions of authorship, & this
on a comically mixed panel, opposite a young man who was
apparently arguing for art's facility to help us develop "a decent
commonsense" etc at which most of us seemed to shrug our
shoulders. sometimes one doesn't know where to begin to dispute.
similar experience with the first speaker on joe's panel--who,
by the way, that is, joe, gave an great paper, one of the most
exciting presentations of the weekend imho, a very strong &
well-executed critique of the rhetoric of craft in so-called "creative"
writing departments--the hardcopy of which I have at hand &
will soon be reading. joe also--humble joe who wouldn't even
mention that he had presented--gave one of the best 2 readings
that I got to see last weekend, of a piece called "glue" & an
excerpt from his forthcoming book which he really ought to
tell us about. my other favorite reading was given by laura
mullen, from a gothic verse-novel in progress, which work was
amazing--I'm an old lovecraft fan, but I had no idea such
stuff could actually be, well, so goddamn'd good or interesting,
let alone push boundaries other than those of space-time & sanity
(but maybe that's an inside joke?). I missed linda russo's reading,
(though I was given a preview of the work), but I was there to
see her give an excellent paper on the poetry of kathleen fraser &
the question of a feminist poetics.

whew. I'm almost as tired from writing this post as I am from
the whole conference.

a few more things: yes, the "postfeminist cyborgs" gave some
good readings & a provocative (inflammatory?) presentation,
which was also a presentation for their site:
                           www.pfplayground.com
I'd highly recommend a visit ["_I'm_ linking up to it..."], though
in saying that I certainly don't mean to imply that I'm in full
agreement with either the use they make of theory or the conclusions
they draw from that use. I have to admit, I was so taken with their
"in your face" attitude ["an all us ex-punk rockers"], but it might take
me awhile to digest their work.

as to a reconciliation? someone mentioned, I mentioned or someone
"preaching to the converted"--possibly, but that's a caricature too.
in some ways it does seem to me, in fact, that we reproduced the
problems we came together to address--exemplified by the opposition
of readings & panels, the fact that at least one of the writers I
knew there probably didn't attend any of the panels, the way fiction
writers would sort of show up as the middle reader in a panel without
a lot of discussion as to the relation between the materials at hand,
or with, in some cases, a generous amount of defensive posturing.
I could, in the spirit of graff's paper, have stood to see more
conflict & less silent contradiction--but then again, I didn't stand
up to foster it, either. on the other hand, there were some very
positive elements to the whole which counterbalance my natural
pessimism, if not entirely, a few very good discussions came out
of it apropos the dis-/union of writing & theory both institutionally
& in the act etc, & I anticipate a few from the conference listserve--
which, by the way, I haven't heard about yet (it's only wednesday),
but which I will bring to the attention of this list at such a time as
etc.

well, apologies are probably in order for such a long posting, if
anyone, that is, has actually read this far. one wonders with email.

Dear Chris Alexander and Joe Amato, hi, it's Kevin Killian.  Between the
two of you, I now have a feel for what happened at this "Denver Conference."

I have to ask, also, did you two fellows reach a consensus with each other
about not using capitalization?  Or is this a total, adjunct *coincidence*?

just kidding,
kevin k.

By the way, is Lisel Mueller on this list?  How about that Lisel walking
away with the Pulitzer Prize for poetry!  Congratulations, Lisel, and
please send your autograph.
not kidding,

According to Toronto's Globe and Mail, Nyro died on Tuesday at her home in
Danbury Conn. She had been battling ovarian cancer. The funeral
arrangements, which are expected to be private are as yet incomplete.

A sad week of these events.

Only what I read in my local paper. She died from ovarian cancer. Had hits
with Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Fifth Dimension, and Barbra Streisand!
Article said she was one of the first singer-songwriters along with Joni
Mitchell.

According to the paper, she died of ovarian cancer. A sad loss, indeed.

Also in my paper today - did anyone else see this? - a column by the
excerable George Will about Ginsberg which made me see red. What a perfect
little shit Mr. Will is. Tom Mandel, you are in Washington. Would you please
deliver him a way overdue "pop to the puss?"

It's Kevin Killian.  I adored Laura Nyro.  I remember my father coming to
me, a broken man, knocking on the door of my room, and saying, "Kevin, we
know you have a right to listen to whatever music you want, and you're 13
now, but your mother and I have agreed to buy you a car if you promise a)
to get out of the house more and b) to surrender those Laura Nyro albums."

One of her records (or maybe it was the sleeve) was impressed with a
strange haunting perfume.  That scent put a spell on me.

George F. Will, symptomatic symbol of "the Reagan Revolution" and other
malignancies to human existence, will die someday just like Allen Ginsberg.
He once wrote of Ginsberg's death with a sneering condescension which
proved to readers several things, among them 1) he never read Allen
Ginsberg, and 2) he felt threatened by the very IDEA of Ginsberg's work.

George F. Will writes of Allen Ginsberg's life in market terms--that of
being a "commodity." Confronted with the severe limitations of Will's
intellect what is one to do? Will is a columnist who is paid well to write
apologias for technocrats, thieves and murderers. Any person whose life
work consisted of promoting peace and charity toward his fellows must by
necessity be "the enemy." With a change in particulars, Will could have a
written a similar column on the death of Christ--'that long-haired
preaching radical got  His just desserts!'  To Ginsberg's credit however,
he never claimed to be the Son of God (to my knowledge).

George F. Will, soldier of American Values, will be forgotten a month after
his death.

Allen Ginsberg's poetry will live and grow
in the heart's of readers.

Fuck George F. Will.

The Ginsberg Commodity

                         By George F. Will

                         Wednesday, April 9 1997; Page A21
                         The Washington Post

                         Allen Ginsberg, symptomatic symbol of the "beat
generation" and other intellectual fads, died
                         last Saturday at age 70. He once wrote, "I'm so
lucky to be nutty." Actually, his pose of
                         paranoia was not luck, it was a sound career move.

                         It became big box office with his famous
declamation of his poem "Howl" in San Francisco in
                         1955. That was the year "Rock Around the Clock,"
in the soundtrack to the movie "The
                         Blackboard Jungle," helped launch what was to
become the third element in the trinity of '60s
                         ecstasies -- sex, drugs and rock-and-roll.
Ginsberg made the first two his projects. He
                         composed "Howl" with the help of a cocktail of
peyote, amphetamines and Dexedrine.

                         Thirty years later his reward for a career of
execrating American values and works was a
                         six-figure contract for a volume of his collected
poetry. It is a distinctive American genius, this
                         ability to transmute attempted subversion into a
marketable commodity.

                         The adjective "beat" was appropriated by Jack
Kerouac from a drug-addicted Times Square
                         thief and male prostitute, who meant by it the
condition of being exhausted by existence. (That
                         man's existence must have been wearying.) Kerouac
attached the adjective to the noun
                         "generation," emulating Gertrude Stein's
identification of the "lost generation" of the 1920s.
                         Soon Life magazine, happy to find some titillating
 unhappiness in a decade defined by
                         Eisenhower's smile, was writing about the beats as
 "The Only Revolution Around." That's
                         entertainment.

                         Back then, poetry commanded crowds. In his book
"When the Going Was Good: American
                         Life in the 1950s," Jeffrey Hart, now a professor
of English at Dartmouth, wrote:

                         "Robert Frost strode onto the stage at Carnegie
Hall to a standing ovation from an overflow
                         house. . . . One night in 1957, T. S. Eliot was
reading his poems to an overflow audience in
                         Columbia's McMillin Theater. Even faculty members
had difficulty getting tickets, and people
                         were crowded into the windows and doors, and
listening outside to Eliot over loudspeakers. .
                         . . Dylan Thomas stood at the podium . . . his
third American tour in two years."

                         When Ginsberg came to Columbia "there was a vast
throng that had been unable to get in.
                         They pounded on the doors and milled around.
Ticket-holders entered between lines of
                         police."

                         Today no poet could cause such excitement on any
campus, or any other American venue, so
                         complete has been the supplanting of words,
written and spoken, by music and movies as
                         preferred modes of communication. One of
Ginsberg's young acolytes, Robert Zimmerman of
                         Hibbing, Minn., put the dissenting impulse to
music as Bob Dylan.

                         Some beats wrote the way some jazz musicians made
music, in the heat of chemically assisted
                         improvisation. Truman Capote's famous dismissal of
 Kerouac's work -- "That isn't writing at
                         all, it's typing" -- had a point. Granted, Kerouac
 revised "On the Road" for six years before it
                         was published in 1957. However, fueled by
Benzedrine, he wrote the first draft of that novel
                         in 1951 in less than three weeks, as one long
single-spaced paragraph -- 120 feet long on
                         12-foot strips of tracing paper taped together.
Here is its beginning:

                         "I first met Dean not long after my wife and I
split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness
                         that I won't bother to talk about, except that it
had something to do with the miserably weary
                         split-up and my feeling that everything was dead."

                         Does that tone of voice seem familiar? Here is the
 beginning of a novel published in 1951, the
                         year of Kerouac's typing frenzy:

                         "If you really want to hear about it, the first
thing you'll probably want to know is where I was
                         born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and
how my parents were occupied and all
                         before they had me, and all that David Copperfield
 kind of crap, but I don't feel like going
                         into it, if you want to know the truth."

                         Yes, "The Catcher in the Rye." Holden Caulfield,
adolescent scold, strong in disapproving
                         "phonies," was a precursor of the beats with their
 passion for "authenticity," which to Ginsberg
                         meant howling echoes of whatever constituted
coffeehouse radicalism of the moment.
                         ("Slaves of Plastic! . . . Striped tie addicts! .
. . Whiskey freaks bombed out on 530 billion
                         cigarettes a year. . . . Steak swallowers zonked
on Television!") With a talent that rarely rose
                         to mediocrity, but with a flair for vulgar
exhibitionism, Ginsberg shrewdly advertised his
                         persona as a symptom of a dysfunctional society.
He died full of honors, including a
                         front-page (and a full page inside) obituary in
the New York Times, a symptom to the end.

Gee, my parents thought I should get out of the house more too! Nyro is
being played quite a bit on the radio here in New York City, and especially
WFUV; the NYTimes obituary is pretty good. As for that perfume, I checked
and there is no trace left on my copy of  "Eli and the Thirteenth
Confession". The absence of this aroma has conjured for me many blank memories.

If you recall, Will also dissed Jerry Garcia upon his death in 1995. Will
seems to enjoy the rhetorical stance of taking potshots at overweight
bearded nearsighted dead guys.

(Or maybe it's counterculture heroes who have stayed heroes? nah--)

Daniel, that is beautifully, forcifully said.  Will's outrageous assault
should not go without a public response. I intend to write him personally
and I suggest others do the same. For all the difference it will make.
Still, better to speak out then mutter in one's room.

George F. Will, symptomatic symbol of "the Reagan Revolution" and other
malignancies to human existence, will die someday just like Allen Ginsberg.
He once wrote of Ginsberg's death with a sneering condescension which
proved to readers several things, among them 1) he never read Allen
Ginsberg, and 2) he felt threatened by the very IDEA of Ginsberg's work.

George F. Will writes of Allen Ginsberg's life in market terms--that of
being a "commodity." Confronted with the severe limitations of Will's
intellect what is one to do? Will is a columnist who is paid well to write
apologias for technocrats, thieves and murderers. Any person whose life
work consisted of promoting peace and charity toward his fellows must by
necessity be "the enemy." With a change in particulars, Will could have a
written a similar column on the death of Christ--'that long-haired
preaching radical got  His just desserts!'  To Ginsberg's credit however,
he never claimed to be the Son of God (to my knowledge).

George F. Will, soldier of American Values, will be forgotten a month after
his death.

Allen Ginsberg's poetry will live and grow
in the heart's of readers.

Fuck George F. Will.

Thanks, I guess, for the George Will piece.

Indulge me while I say what may be obvious. This is not really about
Allen--it's about Allen as symbol for all of the unsettling things that
happened in the sixties, with its "trinity of...ecstasies--sex, drugs and
rock-and-roll," that caused the "decade defined by Eisenhower's smile" to
unravel. It's Will's grand theme, and the grand theme of a lot of
conservatives, who ascribe everything that they dislike in America to
excessive license, of which anything improvisatory, be it jazz, or Allen's
poetry, or _On the Road_, is an example.

The intent of the reference to _Catcher in the Rye_ may be opaque to some
list members. It's the type case of what went wrong from the point of view
of Wills and his like. Not only did it suggest that there might be something
wrong with "the decade typified by Eisenhower's smile," filled with
"titillating unhappiness" (that rare commodity back then) as it is, but it
exposes to the public at large that adolescents (surprise!) are obsessed
with sex. And there's a dirty word in it, which was a very rare phenomenon
back then, when the postal service often effectively acted as censor by
refusing to ship books it found offensive. It was banned from libraries and
schools, and teachers got in trouble for assigning it to their classes.

_Catcher in the Rye_, like _Howl_ and _On the Road_, were nails in the
coffin for the peaceable kingdom as imagined by Wills and company. After
their appearance license was abroad in the land: peopled dressed in ways
that blurred class and gender distinction, they engaged in civil and
not-so-civil disobedience, they had no respect for authority, and they had
fun. Sexuality of all kinds came out of the closet, and sublimation as an
ideal went out the window.

For those who don't remember, Freud had the odd notion that no learning
could happen unless the student repressed all sexuality--something like the
the idea of a limited life-energy that needs to be husbanded. (The need for
this repression was limited, of course, to the middle and upper classes--the
working class, which was the vast majority in his day, could, and did,
wallow like beasts as much as they wished, in his view.) American
conservatives are scandalized by Freud--you mean children are sexual?
parents think those things?--but they find the notion of sublimation comforting.

But I digress. If only the media had been more responsible, by not
publishing the offending books, and certainly by not publicizing them, none
of the bad things would have happened. But they were published, and the bad
things did happen. And conservative idealogues have been trying to undo the
damage by rewriting history ever since.

Saddest in Will's piece is his inability to read the words with pleasure.
Poor George learned from the Jesuits to appreciate certain rhetorical
structures. Somehow he got the idea that those structures were the only ones
permitted; I don't think that that's the intent of Jesuit education.

Actually, as pig-headed as Will is, his piece on GinsbErg does attempt to
locate the poet within the cultural market in which he participated.  And
his implication of Ginsberg as a culture industry cynosure is not entirely
off the mark.  Ginsberg was a cultural icon, a marketable commodity.  I
remember seeing huge billboards in San Francisco with Ginsberg's image
selling Gap khaki pants.  His warmth and affability also made him an
attractive PR spokesman for a group of writers in the 50's.  He attracted
the kind of media attention Kerouac would have preferred to avoid.  But
promotion is, you know, how to stay in business.  And poetry is still
affected by a relentless economic structure.  What's interesting, and what
Will doesn't mention, is how the culture industry makes its own social
subversion into a marketable commodity.

The other relevant moment in the article is when Will writes:

"       When Ginsberg came to Columbia 'there was a vast throng that had
been unable to get in.  They pounded on the doors and milled around.
Ticket-holders entered between lines of police.'

        Today no poet could cause such excitement on any campus, or any
other American venue, so complete has been the supplanting of words,
written and spoken, by music and movies as preferred modes of
communication."

This is a perfectly candid statement to hear as a poet, but the implication
is that Ginsberg's writing is partially responisble for a deterioration in
values which has made the market more open to the movies than poetry.
Wills doesn't follow up on this point, but I find it an important
acknowledgement of poetry's inability to maintain prominence in a market
Ginsberg implicitly condoned and benefitted from.

Anyway, the rest of Will's piece falls apart with the Kerouac quotes, (he
couldn't find Ginsberg quotes?), which are out of place and confusing
because, well, Will wants to say Ginsberg sucks, but he can't say 'sucks'
in public.
All of this leads me, however, to Maria Damon's statement about poetry and
politics.  How does one fight for social change and still survive as an
individual in a corrupt economic system?  How do the contradictions of
political integrity and economic survival play out in the works of
dedicated poets?  The contradictory impulses in Ginsberg's life reveal the
difficult position facing poets today.  Somewhere, between our ideals and
the necessity of the dollar, our lives and art are made.

One unforgettable moment in "The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg" is the
footage from a Ginsberg appearance on Firing Line as Buckley pronounces
Ginsberg "politically naive."  Will, of course, got his start as a protege
of Buckley (remember the YAF of yore?), and might be presumed to
represent what somebody wants us to think of as politcally sophisticated
-- Always easier to sneer at that which one has not read carefully --

But there's another moment in the old Buckley show, following Ginsberg's
reading of "Wales Visitation," when Buckley, I think sincerely, admits to
liking the poem he has just heard (and we can posit all sorts of reasons
rooted in Romanticism and the lyric for why that might have happened) --

Not to defend Buckley or to prefer him over Will by any means -- point is,
that even that thin veneer of responsiveness to intellect has been
stripped from today's "politcal sophistication."


and can somebody give me a citation for the Will piece so that I can read
it?

Yes; Will's bollixed thinking damns commodification of the world;
condemns the poet for *producing*(!) commodifiable 'dysfunction' (sic);
does so with a sublimated ken for A-BETTER-TIME (perhaps pre-60s, but in
any event the proverbial floating signifyer); *and* does all this while
performing his usual role as apologete of capital, plutocracy, and the
aesthetics of stupefaction.

George Will, fuck you with your News Week column.
George Will, will you for chrissake, stop talking about baseball
        on Meet the Press - I don't think you've ever
        picked up a baseball.
George Will, you're like Ted Koppel's puny younger brother, both of you
        part of a profoundly uninteresting yet somehow still annoying
        family down the street.
George Will, you're hair cut looks like Himmler's haircut.
George Will, I would like to compare to Heinrich Himmler but its just
        the haircut, and, I suppose, vaguely, the politics - perhaps
        you were both sycophants to disastrously stupid world leaders,
        yes, ok, you're like a very, very small Himmler.
George Will, you are idiot-corporate-right yin to Sam Donaldson's
        pretend-left yang.
George Will, I won't even dignify you by asking you when you will be
        angelic.
George Will, Ginsberg loved America which is why he gave it
        seventy-three lines of complaint.
George Will, this is it for you, you get nine lines, more than your worth
        and I wouldn't put my queer shoulder to you if you were
        the last pastey-faced, mush-ball conservative in the bar.

Gwyn: I don't remember AG as "overweight". However, he shared those other
characteristics you list, with Garcia (plus which, they were both diabetic,
an affliction, however,* not confined to prophets of the Body Paradise. But
I think you're correct, they were 60s charismatics who retained their power
to move people by the thousands (esp. people who know they are alienated
from themselves, and know some of the causes, like "free market
economies"). Obviously, the powers that be have given considerable
attention to preventing any repeat of 60's communitas-in-insurgency, making
sure no charismatic leaders can unite opposition to the destruction of the
world by money. To acknowledge Ginsberg as heroic can only encourage others
to walk in his steps. George Will is part of money's calculation to
maintain repression. Dirty work, but he has it to do. Support your local

I apologize if you receive this message twice.  I don't think it went
through the first time:
*************************************

Actually, as pig-headed as Will is, his piece on GinsbErg does attempt to
locate the poet within the cultural market in which he participated.  And
his implication of Ginsberg as a culture industry cynosure is not entirely
off the mark.  Ginsberg was a cultural icon, a marketable commodity.  I
remember seeing huge billboards in San Francisco with Ginsberg's image
selling Gap khaki pants.  His warmth and affability also made him an
attractive PR spokesman for a group of writers in the 50's.  He attracted
the kind of media attention Kerouac would have preferred to avoid.  But
promotion is, you know, how to stay in business.  And poetry is still
affected by a relentless economic structure.  What's interesting, and what
Will doesn't mention, is how the culture industry makes its own social
subversion into a marketable commodity.

The other relevant moment in the article is when Will writes:

"       When Ginsberg came to Columbia 'there was a vast throng that had
been unable to get in.  They pounded on the doors and milled around.
Ticket-holders entered between lines of police.'

        Today no poet could cause such excitement on any campus, or any
other American venue, so complete has been the supplanting of words,
written and spoken, by music and movies as preferred modes of
communication."

This is a perfectly candid statement to hear as a poet, but the implication
is that Ginsberg's writing is partially responisble for a deterioration in
values which has made the market more open to the movies than poetry.  Will
doesn't follow up on this point, but I find it an important acknowledgement
of poetry's inability to maintain prominence in a market Ginsberg condoned
and benefitted from.

Anyway, the rest of Will's piece falls apart with the Kerouac quotes, (he
couldn't find Ginsberg quotes?), which are out of place and confusing
because, well, Will wants to say Ginsberg sucks, but he can't say 'sucks'
in public.
All of this leads me, however, to Maria Damon's statement about poetry and
politics.  How does one fight for social change and still survive as an
individual in a corrupt economic system?  How do the contradictions of
political integrity and economic survival play out in the works of
dedicated poets?  The contradictory impulses in Ginsberg's life reveal the
difficult position facing poets today.  Somewhere, between our ideals and
the necessity of the dollar, our lives and art are made.

Actually, I don't think that these were contradictory impulses for Allen. He
took as his project witnessing the external as well as the internal; as a
result reactions to the larger sphere just naturally get expressed in his
work. And I certainly see no evidence in the work that Allen, consumate
self-promoter that he was, ever censored so much as a comma to make a buck.
Incidentally, you would think from Will's piece that Allen had faked his
public stances and his poetry in order to prosper, and that he had succeeded
in doing so from the late 50s on. I remember some years ago reading a survey
of the economics of being a poet. At the time Allen was the only poet in
America who claimed to support himself as a poet. His income that year was
12 grand, on which he supported himself and quite a few others in the scant
luxury that the East Village afforded before the yuppies arrived. It wasn't
until relatively late in his life, when he began teaching regularly (and his
W2 no longer said "poet") that he made a middleclass income. And the book
contract for the collected came very late in his life.

Dale:

Yours is a very intelligent and provocative statement, opening a
discussion that I suspect Ginsbeurg would have welcomed about
himself. Just one question to throw out as first thought, though
not necessarily the better one: this "cultural market" that you
charge Ginsbuerg as being complicit in-- where do you see its, as they
say, horizon? Did Ginsbeurg, in other words, step over some kind of
threshold that you and I (cleaner in life than him) haven't? What is
the qualitative differuence, as you see it, between choosing to buy
Gap pants and posing in them? And when we, for example, choose to
polemicize on this list, are we not engaging in a gesture that is as
fully inscribed in the cultural market as Ginsbuerg's marketing of his
image? I know, I know, you talk about the "gap" between ideals and
necessity, and you seem to grant that we all inhabit that and must
necessarily negotiate, but isn't it a bit too easy for "uncommodified"
poets to criticize across the gap between life and death, and say
that the dead guy sold out when we haven't, even though you
acknowledge that we've all sold out, inevitably, a little bit?

Aren't all of us (each of us, including you with your careful
post) also, at least in portion, marketing an image here? (I mean Dale
Smith, upping those guys and gals who are oblivious to their
chiselled engravings within the poetry money market, but not Dale, who
sees the gap between ideals and necessity, and thus has the banked-
track on freedom. voom.)

Dale,I'll say this: I would like, when I say
something on this list, to impress, to have people think: "Boy, that
Kent Johnson sounds really interesting, I wonder what he is really
like.." Wishful thinking, I'm sure, but I would like my posts to
contribute, little by little, to
a great poetry job somewhere, or to being invited to the party I never
get invited to, to having an even modest cultural status I
haven't yet had, to be thought of as a list insider who is known to
be an insider by those who aren't. There, I said it! (And why,
exactly, does it mildly
startle every single one of you who just read this that I said this?)

I am wearing Gap pants right now as I write, and whatever you are or
aren't wearing Dale, you are, by reading this, between your
ideals and the necessity of the dollar, being called on by Ginsbuerg,
in his koan-billboard, to think a little more deeply
about your own critical certainties. Again,this is first, quick
thought. One I may well regret, post-partum, as I think Rachel
Loden perceptively put it a week or so ago.

but thanks for provoking it.

Keunt

I haven't read the Ginsberg piece by George Will, but I am looking forward to
reading it with and against his recent defense of the Baltimore Orioles'
Roberto Alomar (as I recall, Will proposed to his second wife at home
plate--my god!--in Camden Yards) for spitting on the umpire last season.
 Will goes out of his way to attack umpires in this piece and to defend
Alomar.  Apparently, Will is a non-paid member of the Baltimore Orioles'
board.  Which leads me to my modest proposal: why not put the man on the
poetics list and conflict his interests a bit?

As for AG, while not denying to him remarkable powers of forethought and
networking, I'd say he came by them "honestly" in the sense that he trusted
himself to act the way he wanted himself to act, and that after many many
other upshots of such conduct thru decades, he sold his archive for a cool
mill to stanford. It was no more than Moloch owed him. I'd certainly place
this transaction in the category "The Contradictions of Capitalism," but
not without a "so what>" remainder.   I dont think that John Ashbery, who
must have realized almost as much cash from his total immersion in poetry,
is the least bit likely to be criticized for doing so. I find it harder to
keep abreast of Ashbery's poetry, just that there is so much in it, that
won't yield to a quick scan. But it probably doesnt as bluntly deplore
capitalist malpractice, as AG's does. If so, it is very differently
encoded, and not in a sinister way, but because Ashbery is a great
individual human being who, to one view of it, can't help but be who he is,
but who knows all he has learned concerning what to do with that perhaps
burdensome nexus of knowledge.

 So is it the gap between avowed belief and actual practice that distresses
some of our number here? Are we back at Pound the poet vs. Pound the
fascist? Is it Ginsberg the Ghandi figure vs. Ginsberg the US millionaire?
(These arent the rhetorical figures, mind made up, they may sound to be.
I'm asking. And Sure, the poor soul not yet cold in his grave.) Is it bad
for poets to make money, as it is bad for RC priests to make love to their
congregation? For poets of a certain, evident kind of social
commitment--also, therefore, a kind of censorship?  How are we going to
deal with this?  Is it just something we're gonna have to forget (B. Dylan,
"Clothesline Saga") or is it something one way or another we're going to
try to legislate for? If so, we shall need to be willing to support our
poets, and, I think, w/o regard to the value we personally find in their
writing.

The commodification of Ginsberg surely had more energy from the Other side
than from AG. The energy from AG was NOT primarily directed towards this
end. He surfed it well once the wave was there. As have a number of other
poets living and dead. I dont want to fly off on this tangent, the way our
soc'y requires of an artist an identifiable style, "Oh yeah, he's the one
who does squiggles & dots," it's pathetic, reprehensibly a shrinking of
life in its variousness, and stems (but this is another argument for
another day) from the mounting ascension to primacy of the snapshot, even
if only of a President on a greenback. But who is there to reprehend, to
witness such reprehension. Just put the funds in my account. I'll decide on
my charities later, thanks.

Despite the scuttlebutt, people get famous because about them is something
we need. This covers even Lorraine Bobbit. It may be down to Chance, but
it's no accident. You or I might have opted to pay Ginsberg in kind (from
each according), not having much money, but imagine wanting to repay his
crackling energy and feeling you only have money to do it with. It's
difficult for people to feel indebted w/o trying to do something abt it. Au
fond, he made people feel good--in his case, literate persons of some
awareness concerning soc'y. If we are going to continue the ancient
practice of rewards, why not have rewarded AG for his impromptu existence,
so responsibly coped with?

I guess all this is to suggest that commodity isnt the bottom line, the
inescapable circumscription of our lives--if it were, there'd be no naming
it. AG included the commodity, but the commodity does not include, w/o
remainder, AG.    db

well, the thing is, allen was never a millionaire.  when he got money from
stanford for his archives he had enough to finally get a place on the lower
east side with elevator access for himself and his step-mother.  and he
immediately went out and bought some salvation army couches to furnish the
place.  the money that allen made as a poet always went back into the
community-- he kept a lot of poets and artists from living on the street.

For what it's worth, I once, as a beginning grad student not knowing my
place, asked Ginsberg about the Gap Ad (even going so far as to remind him
that the Gap was utterly complicit in the Asian child-labor catastrophes
which were prominent in the news at the time).  To his credit, he didn't
duck the question.  He said he had a good deal of doubt about his
decision, that he had rejected the Gap many times, but had, the last time,
decided that donating the money (I think to Naropa?) would do more good
than harm.  He then went on to a talk about his complicity in the
marketplace, a monologue not unlike the dialogue we've been having about
AG & capitalism.

If you think that the Will version of Ginsberg was lame, see today's
column by Paul Ginsburg (a columnist via Arkansas, whose columns
appear in places like The Tuscaloosa News, a NY Times owned
newspaper).  PG's claim (which I read hastily & angrily early this
morning) is that AG is a personality but NOT A POET.  That AG's poems
aren't really poetry.  That interest in AG's poetry is symptomatic of
"our" swerve away from "real" "great" poetry.  That AG's poetry will
soon fade from view, and then "we" can return to reading truly
"great" poetry again.  Makes me uncertain: scream, or barf.  Of
course, much of AG's poetry stems from prior examples of what I think
of as "poetry":  Blake, Whitman, and the Prophets of the Old
Testament.  I hope others on the List run across PG's column....

Kent:

My impulse for writing in response to Will's article had to do with the
recurring "fuck-you" posts which I find stupid and irresponsible.  Will's
article is grossly unfair, if not evil and pernicious, but telling Will to
fuck himself behind his back, or not, simply confirms his belief in the
poverty of cultural values today.  So I picked up scant points of his which
seemed appropriate and acknowledged that much of the rest of the article
had no value at all.  As for your questions:

"Just one question to throw out as first thought, though
not necessarily the better one: this "cultural market" that you
charge Ginsbuerg as being complicit in-- where do you see its, as they
say, horizon? Did Ginsbeurg, in other words, step over some kind of
threshold that you and I (cleaner in life than him) haven't? What is
the qualitative differuence, as you see it, between choosing to buy
Gap pants and posing in them? And when we, for example, choose to
polemicize on this list, are we not engaging in a gesture that is as
fully inscribed in the cultural market as Ginsbuerg's marketing of his
image? I know, I know, you talk about the "gap" between ideals and
necessity, and you seem to grant that we all inhabit that and must
necessarily negotiate, but isn't it a bit too easy for "uncommodified"
poets to criticize across the gap between life and death, and say
that the dead guy sold out when we haven't, even though you
acknowledge that we've all sold out, inevitably, a little bit?"

Ginsberg didn't step through any threshold.  There is no threshold, as far
as I can tell.  We're all implicated in cultural and economic market
practices.  Whether posing for Gap pants or wearing them makes no
difference.  But if you endorse a certain product while simultaneously
engaging in social activism, then the irony of that position will be
noticed, whether it's right or wrong. Will's article pointed out this
contradiction in a cultural industry Will, Ginsberg, myself-anyone who
writes-is a part of.  This position is magnified with Ginsberg, however, so
he's an easy target for people like Will who act as if they are themselves
beyond reproach.  And, by the way, I never said Ginsberg sold out and I
don't even think I implied it, and if I did, well, that's my fault as a
critical writer.  And I'm sad he's dead but his death is the occasion for
such moments as these and I think as much meaning should be milked from
debate rather than saturating ourselves only with warm platitudes.

"Aren't all of us (each of us, including you with your careful
post) also, at least in portion, marketing an image here? (I mean Dale
Smith, upping those guys and gals who are oblivious to their
chiselled engravings within the poetry money market, but not Dale, who
sees the gap between ideals and necessity, and thus has the banked-
track on freedom. voom.)"

I guess e-mail posts could be viewed as "marketing an image" rather than
provoking debate.  Touch=E9.  I'm not trying to "up" anybody.  The occasion
of my post was, again, George Will's unflattering and unjust article on
Ginsberg's death.  With the same amount of fame I'm sure many of us, self
included, would be held up for critical scrutiny, just and unjust alike.

"I would like my posts to contribute, little by little, to
a great poetry job somewhere, or to being invited to the party I never
get invited to, to having an even modest cultural status I
haven't yet had, to be thought of as a list insider who is known to
be an insider by those who aren't. There, I said it! (And why,
exactly, does it mildly startle every single one of you who just read this
that I said this?)"

Hey, the above sounds good to me too, except the part about being a "list
insider," whatever that means.

"I am wearing Gap pants right now as I write, and whatever you are or
aren't wearing Dale, you are, by reading this, between your
ideals and the necessity of the dollar, being called on by Ginsbuerg,
in his koan-billboard, to think a little more deeply
about your own critical certainties. Again,this is first, quick
thought. One I may well regret, post-partum, as I think Rachel
Loden perceptively put it a week or so ago."

Actually, I'm wearing a burlap sack and beating myself with a stick.

"but thanks for provoking..."

No problem.

Can anyone provide info on interviews with or articles about Michael Franti,
hiphop/performance poet? (My knowledge so scarce right now that Franti may
be anything _but_ a hiphop/performance poet.)

And as to Laura Nyro: I was dropping acid weekly as a member of _your_ US Air
Force (sleep well tonight . . . ) when she first sang those wrenching things
that were prettified by the cover artists mentioned above (and "covering"
rarely seemed like such a blanket job). Down by the grapevine . . .

I was at Denver, too, and found those large, lumpy, pointed earth constructions
on the horizon an interesting variation from the daily experience of bayou life.
The grad students were mountain-water-sweet and industrious beyond any
reasonable expectation, the panels, though crowded together, made good space for
non-traditional approaches to the metatextual metissage, and a fair mix of
dispositions got to crow and strut, not too obnoxiously. I agree that Graff
felt a little underprepared (yet over-rehearsed) in delivering his plea for
"conversation" between theory types and C.W. types (I was the guy who said
that it might be more productive to continue the present spectrum of relations
from sleeping together to contempt (can't we all just not get along?). As to
Marjorie Perloff, I thought the presentation on "Yasusada" was just the kind
of thing to send most of us crawling back to our departments with our scholarly
tails between our critical legs; but its conclusion--that all the goofy
phenomena of publication and appreciation surrounding those texts could somehow
be attributed to (and _blamed on_, if you think the whole business was somehow
distasteful) "Identity Theory" seemed a leap-and-a-half: no self-respecting
postcolonial practitioner, for instance, would have slept through the signs
of bogusness (or alibied her/his way around not having done some fact-checking)
that Perloff held to be at issue. Can't we all just leave each other the hell
alone?

And now I find my head hurting a little from all the G_Will, inc., stuff, as if
hacking at (up?) his "prose" somehow could ease the etc. And of course, for some
it can. Do keep in mind his lifelong difficulty, though (innate? learned?), at
parsing lyric thought into anything but the, uh, categories of daily columnar
preachifyin'-to-the-converted: remember his o'er-hasty embrace of that
ringing celebration of Deep American Virtu, "Born in the USA." Or, really now,
is this just a headachey way of iterating a replicant fuck you?

thanks lisa:  this ressentiment of someone who's gotten famous and made
enough $ at 70 to finally live with half the luxury that many of us (who
teach, for example) take for granted is most unseemly. not that we can't
ask questions about commodification and compromise, but the edge of bad

very distasteful and distracting.--md

If you look at that ad, in tiny type running vertically on the side, it does
say that the proceeds from the use of the photo have been donated to Naropa.
Since I have always believe the smallest type in an ad is the most important
I appreciated this bit of counter-information. There was nothing similar in
the other Gap ads in the series.

Interesting, Susan...I don't suspose Will mentions the one really
interesting bit of gossip in the baseball world about that incident..That
Hirschbeck used a homophobic word, and that that's the reason for the
spitting (...I guess in that case he should feel grateful it wasn't Tom
Mandel he was addressing, or the response might have been more solid);
this cropped up on Atlanta radio some time ago, but was really given
credence by a spot Peter Gammons did two weeks ago on ESPN, where he kept
uneasily and paraphrastically saying that "there are just some words you
don't use to someone from a Latin culture.." and finally narrowing it down
to references to a singular "word" that you shouldn't ever use to someone
from a Latin culture (..the "f" word presumably).  Gammons knows most of
what's going on in baseball, so I take it that that's strong confirmation.
From both a poet's and a political activist's point of view, the whole
affair becomes fascinating, in that there is this EVENT people talk about,
and then (maybe) this VERBAL act at the very heart of it all, that NO ONE
WILL MENTION..the word made evasion and silence.

Isn't this the battle for history, and wasn't Allen Ginsberg always on
the frontlines, for better or for worse? Which is why the GWs hate him
so much. How would he have responded to Wills? I don't think with
anger . . .

Did anyone else see the obit in the NY Post? It opened something like
"Allen Ginsberg, who wrested poetry away from the academics and
returned it to the people . . ."

You're right in that ellipses have two foci, and I'm no celestial mechanic, but
the sun can be considered to be at or near one of the foci. I say near because
there are many comets where the sun is actually between the vertex and the near
focal point. There is another geometrical focal point, but whether or not there
is something "there" has been an open topic for speculation (ie the Oort cloud
idea, or like cpt. Kwirk, "there's something out there..."). The "something out
there" forming the other focal point is not necessary for an elliptical orbit
to take place though. The orbits of all solar system bodies have constantly,
from the beginning, been perturbed by mutual gravitation so that the orbits
intersect one another and elongate (become eccentric). The smaller bodies
having the most eccentric orbits. Mercury has a very eccentric orbit for
example.Hope that helps.

Resident logician writes:

It's about the ancient theory of conic sections, and Kepler's
laws of planetary motion.

Think of a plane slicing through a cone --- if it is orthogonal to the
axis of the cone, you get a circle. If you tilt a bit, you get an
ellipse.

Tilt more, and you get curves that are not closed (parabolas and
hyperbolas) --- if your comet is on one of them,  it will never come
back. Given that Hale-Bopp is in the habit of coming back, albeit
infrequently, it must be on an elliptical orbit that is very elongated.
Kepler's laws apply: the sun must be one of the foci of the ellipse.

What happens to the other focus?  It is, of course, a mathematical
abstraction, and in a sense it is not in use.  There is only one sun,
and the sun's gravitational pull is both necessary and sufficient to
keep a comet on an elliptical orbit.

Kepler's laws can be easily derived from Newton's ("the two body
problem"), as an exercise in pure mathematics.

I remember it being said that the Hale-Bopp orbit is roughly
perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. This may explain
its relatively quick entry and exit.

Yeah, so the world is full of jerks.  What else is new?  I think all the
post-mortem arguments about Ginsberg only point to his immense vitality as
a poet and as a cultural figure, the linkage of which has become
increasingly rare in popular American culture.

(This is my first post on the list)

The following is an excerpt from a post by Kent Johnson.  It is an incredibly
honest personal statement and I feel that it requires particular attention.  In
a dialogue about poetry, A. Ginsberg, and whether it is possible *not* to
participate in the corrupt market system we are necessarily a part of, he said,
among many things:

Dale, I'll say this: I would like, when I say
>something on this list, to impress, to have people think: "Boy, that

>startle every single one of you who just read this that I said this?)

I think it may startle because of its stunning honesty. And it comments on the
discussion at hand-- that is: how one can be an artist, activist, and socially
responsible while simultaneously  complicit in the very structures that one
wishes to expose and inform against.  I am glad that the obvious was said-- that
participation in this "utopian" arena for dialogue is not outside the market
system we (myself included) engage in every moment, not outside structures and
institutions of power.  While we strive to engage in something that may
illuminate or transform through ideas, art, or creating a community-- we cannot
*escape* the conditions we live in.

And in the preceding sentence I illustrated this very thought-- that as a woman
of color I cannot be *outside* prejudice or racism--that inescapably is
contained even in the language I use -- using the word "illuminate" valuing
light/white-ness.--writing in a language of colonialism, using my expensive
computer, using and using energy, etc.  It is a contradiction.  I think exposing
this is tantamount to transforming it-- and I think that is what we are doing,
that it *is* a process.  I do not understand why engaging in the dialectic leads
people to believe one is "charging" someone of something.

(Although, as I have read in the archives,  finger-pointing /
wanting-to-punch-someone-in-the-mouth morality policing, does occur).

"America, go fuck yourself with your atom bomb."

"America, I'm not sorry."

Dales,

I'm not sorry if you think my "fuck George F. Will"
is "stupid and irresponsible."

I'm not sorry if you think my "fuck George F. Will"
"confirms his belief in the poverty of cultural values today."

If he could define them, and if I could take the time to read them, I'm
sure I could have a grand time mocking them for the amusement of the
Poetics list.

If you think my "fuck George F. Will" is an act of cowardice because it was
"behind his back" let me assure that I would love to have the opportunity
to meet the man and enjoy a real conversation, in which I may or may not
use the oh-so-shocking "F" word, depending on the amount of sneering
condescension he emits.

You are obviously impressed with George F. Will's authority to the extent
that in a worthless diatribe in which he shits on a man's life work you
find "scant points . . . which seemed appropriate."  Which points were they
Dales? The ones that implicate all writers and activists in "cultural and
economic market practices." Are you taking a correspondence course with
George F. Will?

You said, "his death is the occasion for such moments as these and I think
as much meaning should be milked from debate rather than saturating
ourselves only with warm platitudes."

Yes, let's debate and milk (milk?) the moment and we may learn something
from one another, but don't begin by telling ME to settle down and be
reasonable because it only makes me more angry.

The point is our telling Will to fuck himself or not has absolutely no
consequence. Personally I think it more appropriate to ask him to shut up
about something of which he knows nothing. Fucking is so lovely after all. A
deluge of letters of the oh shut up fool variety might at least raise his
eyebrow.

Will came in my place of employ on Tuesday (his office is two blocks away),
the day after I'd got back from going to New York to sit w/ Allen G. I have
NOTHING to say to George Will. He represents the obligatory violence of mass
media controled society. I do not think he is aware of this as he is so
thoroughly indoctrinated. The man, tho human, is lost to that part of being
human which Ginsberg & so many other artists-- what's the right word here--
give? represent? create? In any case there is as much reason to feel sorry
for George Will as to be angry-- to make a living spewing the idiot venom,
this cannot be good for any "soul."

If anyone is interested in coming to Tucson --

I just heard of a small casita (although big enough to be a one-bedroom
apt. w/small art studio) which has just become available and is for rent
for only $250/month. It's in the middle of South Tucson, which isn't
everybody's favorite part of town, but it's on the same property as some of
my favorite people in all of Tucson -- Alex Garza, sculptor, who directs a
program in which "at risk" teenagers make public art, mostly mosaic murals;
and his spouse, Yolanda Galvan, a visual artist/illustrator who works at an
organization called Southwest Parks & Monuments.

And if anyone is REALLY interested, it might be a good way to become a Chax
Press intern/apprentice for several months (or more) on a parttime basis,
working on handmade book projects and press administrative work, have a
very inexpensive place to live with room for one's own art studio or
writing studio, and still have plenty of time to find another job which
would more than pay the rent.

Yes, it's all a bit complicated, but I thought I'd mention it.

David B--the comment on where George Will made his proposal came from an
instant fear that a man so conservative might say, "a woman's place is at
home
plate," that's all.  I doubt he'd say that about second base, though he is
surely off base (or just base) about most things.

Thanks to Maxine Chernoff for mentioning that I'll be giving a reading in San
Francisco.  It's on May 1 at 7:30 at the Cafe Sapore (in North Beach

Speaking of this image/commodity thing, there's a passage from Michael
Palmer's last book that seems to connect, though I'm baffled as to
precisely how. That would be the point, I guess. How to read
this? It makes me jealous: I wish I would have thought of it for my
death poem.

Subject:      ginsberg and snyder

Gary Snyder lectured and read here in Freeport, Illinois tonight. It
was quite incredible, frankly. He finished by reading/singing the
magpie poem, prefacing it with a long, moving eulogy for AG. When he
started to choke-up, he said it was his asthma, which disappointed me
a little bit, but that's ok.

Inclement weather of the worst kind, but still over 150 people
in attendance, maybe a couple dozen of them farmers who came
because (my romantic leftist mind hopes) the lecture was entitled
"The Relationship between Capitalism, Ethics, and the Environment."
Probably, though, because Gary was billed to be introduced by my
beloved friend, Dan Smith, a Freeport poet with a very big local
following and who's a dairy farmer well-known for his "sustainable
ag" practices (new book, _Home Land_, out from Bottom Dog Press).

As I was driving him to Dan's house where he spent the morning, Gary
told me of a long telephone talk he had with AG two days before Allen
died. At the time, Allen was operating under the impression of two
to six months. Gary said that AG was "sad but not overly so," and was
"a bit pissed-off that he'd just put this new kitchen into his
apartment and now was barely going to get to use it." Then he changed
the subject.

As you approach Dan's farm, there is a trailer surounded with 50 or
60 carcasses of cars, some of them 40's and 50's models. I noticed
that Snyder was looking intently at this sight (the infamous "white
trash" Bechtel household). Then he said with the utmost conviction:
"Now there is some really really good stuff."

By the way, I haven't seen any posts about this: does everyone know
that _Mountains and Rivers without End_ was awarded the Bollingen a
few weeks back?

I'm driving Gary to the airport tomorrow and I'm going to askl him
what he thinks about Allen posing for the Gap ad.

actually, the strangest obituary I've heard in the electronic media occured
on an Altoona/Johnstown Pennsylvania station. An anchorwoman coiffed to
look like a humanoid version of Miss Polly Purebred concluded the 7 second
piece (part of the "around the world in a minute" feature common to most
local newscasts) by saying, "Ginsberg's poetry grew out of his homosexual
experiences and his communistic upbringing."  For a brief moment, I had a
sense of what it was like to be alive during the 1950s (especially given
the production values of this particular newscast).

why wd this startle? it falls well within the continuum of normal human

speaking of sports, i took in When We Were Kings this past week. it's got
some fun poetry in it, and reminded me of when i was a little girl and the
Clay/Liston fight was gonna be on. (it was memorable to me cuz we didn't
have a tv, but we were at a ski lodge for a week and the ski lodge had a
tv, so everything on tv that week sticks in my mind).  the newscasters kept
reading a poem clay had written for the occasion and i adored it.  can
anybody post that poem here?  free copies of *my* book and the new
cross-cultural poetix to the person who obliges.--md

I have already apologized to Linda Russo back-channel for whatever vitriol
exists in my joke-posting (Allan, Creely, Olsen, Leverton). I explained to
her that when at play with Mr.Bowering, I can get carried away, and that I
was joshing  h i m , neglectful of the fact that like it or not I was also
tweaking her. I even suggested she post in to "Mr.Bromide and Mr.Boring"
thanking them for their "correction". She was too nice to do so, but by an
odd coincidence, Mr. B himself addressed me on the list as the one, and
there I was with a snappy comeback, the other, ready to hand. Indeed, as
Adorno observed, names are frozen laughter, and the displacement of a
single letter can release it. This makes typos in names stick out further
than typos in other words, and may explain the energy Linda Russo's
"GinsbUrg" has drawn. db

it seems to me that part of the problem here is that we've started,
already, from too general a category, or perhaps in plain confusion,
with the term "cultural market". while we've acknowledged the market
structure of the "cultural" (itself a blanket term)--cultural capital
etc a la bourdieu--we've also conflated the two fields on the basis of
that structure, which should be accounted autonomous, at least to the
best of our ability to do so.

so it's both less clear & more clear than presented.
["playing for time"]["doesn't have an answer, does he?"]

I mean, yes, there is a difference between "marketing an image" on the
poetics list, or in any social-institutional setting--ie, vying for
cultural capital, which is a part of our activities here, whether
debate or reminiscence, or foolin' around foolery--& participating in
an advertisment--which involves an exchange of "real", ie, monetary
capital--, & for a company that, as noted by Michael Mcgee, came to be
recognized-- though not, I'm certain, before Ginsberg agreed to do the
ad--as complicit in the exploitation of child-labor in Southeast Asia.
not just an evaluative difference, ie, in terms of what I value or
de-value by my judgements, particularly as they are informed by my
awareness of the crimes of commodity capitalism, & the accompanying
guilt over my own (platitudinous) participation in the maintenance of
the same, but a demonstrable difference. ["demonstrable as in
rhymes-with-objective?"]. what I mean is that my own feeling about the
difference between the two activities is that, at worst, we, by
participating on this list are engaged by our participation in a
discourse which legitimates an institution that we all believe in;
whereas Ginsberg, by posing for the Gap ad, is participating not only
in self-promotion, the promotion of Allen Ginsberg as a cultural
phenomenon--the accumulation of cultural capital on a different
field--, or the support & possibly the promotion of Naropa, but
directly in the maintenance of commodity capitalism as it's
represented by the Gap--ie, making a direct statement, as it were, of
support for the current economic system, which is, as Dale points out,
ironically opposed to the Ginsberg more generally familiar. that's not
so much of a criticism as it sounds; clearly, as, again, Michael
Mcgee's post indicates, Ginsberg was well aware of the intersection of
these two fields in his act, & the contradictions that intersection
involved, & so not necessarily acting as a "sell-out" or a "capitalist
stooge" (remember that Bloom County of a few years back? we still have
some Penguin Love t-shirts available). in fact, that's not at all
where I mean to locate the above statements, in a sort of disappointed
rock fan accusation of heresy, or in the quest for a more saintly
canon. nor do I think Dale was expressing any other than the sort of
puzzlement that I am, or that Ginsberg himself evidently expressed.

note: "puzzlement" as in trying a difficult problem by
experiment, not a disappointed confusion or the like.

Dale wrttttt:
>Ginsberg didn't step through any threshold.  There is no threshold,
>as far as I can tell.  We're all implicated in cultural and economic
>market practices.

without wanting to initiate a witch hunt, I think it's
fair to say that Ginsberg *did* cross a sort of line,
the line from the accumulation of cultural capital &
what that entails, to the accumulation, for whatever
good reason--& he had reasons which he felt were
sufficient--, of monetary capital & what that entails.

again--sorry if I sound defensive, but the point might
easily be misunderstood--this isn't hurtful surprise at
Ginsberg having Taken Money--which I'd gladly take
if it were offered from ["any offers yet?"]--as much as
it is to point up the difference, as I see it, between--well,
ie, the Gap not so much between ideals & necessity,
as between "the economy" & the/a cultural economy,

or vice versa. & maybe that's not such a long gap, either,
as the excerpt that Kent brings from At Passages indicates,
which is not to say that care needn't be taken in handling

that difference, but that it is worth pointing out, as does Dale in
his post, the culture industry's ability to turn rebellion to a profit.
the small print Ginsberg apparently insisted on may have worked

against that agenda, in a "bid" to subvert, however incompletely,
the Gap's attempt to use his recognizable counter-culture status--
which isn't, I think, much different from Levi Strauss' attempt to

buy the graffiti www site, mentioned here a few months back--, but
the incompleteness of that subversion is apparent in the fact that the
small print merely contributes to that status in association with the Gap.

in other words, even this gesture, made specifically against the context
in which Ginsberg appears modeling Gap pants, can be read as furthering
the aims of the Gap, Inc. (?) as much as those of Ginsberg or Naropa.

but I think that's less a criticism of Ginsberg (as on the cover of
his books?) than all of us, or none. (quick detour from puzzlement to
feeling pessimistic). & my intuition, from M. Mcgee's post, is that
Ginsberg would have looked favorably on our consideration of that
problem, particularly as it might (any minute now) swing toward a
collective self-examination, & away from a game of othering the Other.
though, if there's anything of which I can be certain, it's that
Ginsberg would have us conduct ourselves with a bit more humor &
compassion, even in the face of gravest circumstance. ["gravest...?"]

"love my rhetoric? try Pixidium, the capsular fruit that dehisces
so the upper part falls off just like a cap. no more messy furnit"

as to the difference between posing for an advertisment
for the Gap & wearing pants with the Gap label: in this
matter, or, I should say, in this particular case, there's
not such a difference. (I'm wearing Levi's 501s, which
can be read any number of ways, really, & a cheap, pink,
ink-stained t-shirt made by some company called Rivet).
more than anything, the danger here is that we might
return to the "what are you wearing" thread.

or we could talk about the difference in terms of the
potential intersection of fields. but I'm not about to.

by the way, Kent, I, for one, do look forward to your posts,
&, were I to have a party, would surely invite you. that's not
likely, however, as I live where I do live, & so couldn't expect
much of a turnout, despite my own carefully written posts etc.

In 1991 I was teaching a modern lit course in Tucson. We were discussing a
novella by Platonov called "Dzan" (which, by the way, I strongly recommend)
by the Russian writer Platonov. Platonov, who was no fool and suffered
plenty under Stalin, was both a dedicated, revolutionary believer in the
sort of humane socialism to which the Soviet government often gave lip
service even at the worst of times and a christian of sorts (or at least
friendly to christian symbolism). The hero of "Dzan" is something like a
communist St. Francis. My students had a hard time understanding the idea
that a communist, or even a socialist, could harbor benign or altruistic
motives--both words were, in their experience, expletives and little more.
As one woman, an adult student of maybe 35, put it, "I was always taught
that all communists are evil." The kids were even more perplexed. Maybe the
world wasn't so simply divided into good and evil.
History, for them, had been rewritten to exclude the idealism that the
bolshevik rulers manupulated for their own ends but that surely motivated
many of their followers--a fair proportion of the world's population--and
that offered an alternative vision, however impractical, of human
posibilities. It had been rewritten at the movies, on television, and in the
popular press.
The 60s has been rewritten and domesticated by the fashion-mongers, who make
big bucks off of retro radicalism as a fashion statement: clothing whose
major virtue was that it cost almost nothing, blurred class distinctions and
broke the hold of fashion has become a class marker for those who can afford
it. You can book a tour on a hippie bus and do hippie things--a great way to
meet other singles, I'm told. As for politics, there's a whole industry
devoted to rewriting that, and George Will is in its employ.
Saying fuck you to George Will won't get us anywhere. The reason it's
important to answer him is that he and his are rewriting the recent past,
our own experience of the world.
Answering him here doesn't do a whole lot of good--it's mostly preaching to
the choir. But it's not a bad thing to do in our classes. It's why I teach a
lot of history whatever the course bulletin says I'm teaching. Those who
don't know history may not be doomed to repeat it, but they are doomed to
having it misappropriated.

At the risk of stating the obvious, perhaps some of our concerns about
Wills' obit grow out of a feeling of becoming worried not
only about the loss of a very important poet, but also a great leader. AG
used his literary notoriety extremely effectively for excellent causes.
Like many other poets and artists he stood up non-violently against the
Government's war in Vietnam. Today's media avoids the process of creating
revolutionary figures like Ginsberg. We are grieving, in this cruel April
of a Nazional Poetry Month, not only the loss of a great poet ,but one of
the last of the media revolutionaries that helped save this country from

on us survivors. The most astounding thing about AG is that he insisted

Took Snyder to the airport bus today and told him about the Will
article. He didn't know about it. He said, "Really? Good. That's good.
This will help start up a bigger discussion about Allen." I told him
about the many heartfelt, moving statements about Allen on this list.
He said, "Really? Good. That's Charles Bernstein's creation, right?
Hmmmm... Good, good..."

Snyder really is a warm and impressive guy. He's reading at Harvard
May 1 for those of you in that area. When he sings some of his poems,
he sounds like Pete Seeger. I mentioned here yesterday that magpie
poem he sang for AG. When it's over he says, "And then the magpie
flew away."

Hey Chris Alexander, that was some tour de force with the last post.
And I don't care if you're in Utah. I've never been invited to a
party in Utah. Call me.

It's easy now to look back with historical hindsight & conflate or deflate
the Gap between Bob Dylan & Allen Ginsberg on the cybernet revolution
front.  But no one has been able to deny the pivotal importance of Dan
Bouchard's post of early april 1997 in which he wrote, "fuck you
George Will".  The repercussions have been endless, the ramifications
proliferate dissertationly in a dizzying pyrotechnic of etc. Dan, did you
mean by this - I mean, were you conscious when you put on those overalls
so to speak - of the immense sea-change about to take place?  I think you
were.  I want to tell a personal anecdote about Dan:  this must have been
in about 2004 - he was confronted by a pack of nouveau-zelot-heads with
microphones - & he EMPATHIZED with thier CONCERNS - I KNOW he THOUGHT
TWICE before he lifted that pack of million-yen contributions & tossed
it into the Yangtzee.  Henry Gould, (remember him?), before he died in
that fatal sewing accident (those needles...) in 1999, often said - in
those quaint little Spandrift posts of his - "Dan's o.k.  He'll make
a good Chairman, whatever they say."  No one can obligerate the truth of
that modest observation, at least at this late hour, not by any means (or
ends, for that matter). Shantih shantih shantih

Every time I teach a lit course I teach the history as well.  In the
standard AmLit sequence, I always go into the history of the American
Communist party of the 1920s, for example.  The students for the most part
know nothing about it (though a few do, and that number seems to be
increasing). The simple Communism (bad)/Democracy (good) dichtomy has been
absorbed by people who don't even know what these words mean.  I see it too
when I teach the early American course--the actual writings of "the
Founding fathers" surprise them--especially Thomas Paine's writrings on
religion. They've been told in High School (?) what's in these texts but
haven't examined them themselves.

This semester, I'm teaching American Poetry 1950-1965 for Sophomores.  When
the news of Ginsberg's health first came through last Friday, I was
preparing notes for a class discussion of O'Hara's _Lunch Poems_.  We
closed with the last poem, "Fantasy" (dedicated to the health of Allen
Ginsberg).

Over the weekend the announcement of Ginsberg's death came over the list,
and on the news.  This week's class included a discussion of the Will
column (which several of my students had seen) and the responses here on
this list (which I brought in--a few I even posted to the web page I set up
for the class).

This course is listed as "Literature and Society" so I've had plenty of
opportunity to discuss the late fifties/early sixties era in the class.
Mark Weiss is correct when he points out how this era has been rewritten.
But it isn't just the 60s.

Speaking of history being rewritten, I shuddered a few years ago that my
daughter's brand new history book (jr high level) had as much information
on Grenada (2 paragraphs) as it did on the Viet Nam War.  And try to find
a single text for kids taught in the regular curriculum that even mentions
the American Labor Movement.  So no wonder that when they arrive in
college, they are maybe aware of Allen G as MTV celeb instead of fine poet
and political activist.  My solution at home: tell my kids about alternate
history, take them to events that proliferate the truth about American
political policy, etc.

It's an odd consciousness reflected in those books as well, very
inconsistent.  My younger sons are now being taught about Japanese
internment camps, slave rebellions before the Civil War, etc., (younger
kids and newer book still) but no change in the omissions cited above.

I'd been unable to read the list for about 3 weeks (swamped) when Allen
died and I began to stick my nose in again to the daily digest. I missed, but
someone has mentioned to me, Pat Pritchett suggesting that I punch George Will
in the nose. Using, apparently, the pop I'd put aside for poor Ed Dorn's snoot
were he to say bad things to me (he hasn't -- rest easy).

I'll get to George in a moment.

I think the outpouring of sentiment about AG was wonderful. I first
encountered
him when, a just-teen unfledged poet, I attended the now-famous (and
then-fabulous)
Big Table reading in Chicago. He had such a dark and liquid voice alive. He
was
poetry incarnate, how could anyone ever doubt him a poet? What an idea!

Odd, however, is the debate about his status as "a millionaire." His image
on a GAP
ad. I haven't seen much of this debate, but it seems pathetic to me.
Actually, I'd
heard that Allen was dismayed to be offered one mil only for his papers. I
kind of
agree. I think the library that bought them got a hell of a deal. That is,
they'll
be worth a lot more to the institution.

As to AG associating himself with a corporation "utterly complicit" in
Asian child
labor, so does everyone on this list whether knowingly or not. If virtually
every
pair of sneakers available comes from that context, is virtue defined by
going shoeless? And should that be Allen shoeless, or you. How'd the coffee
bean
get in your cup -- picked by union labor?

The question is whether you work against what you think is objectionable. I
don't know how Allen Ginsberg could have worked harder to fight the ugliness
that has risen and risen in our time.

Speaking of "ugliness... risen in our time" -- I think it would only be fair
to give George Will his choice of weapons. George, my second Pat Pritchett
will be in touch with your second.

Should George choose pistols, I'll insist on cap. Should he choose wit, I'll
ask David Bromige to represent me.

howard zinn's book A People's History of the United States or some such is
very good for this purpose. it's thick tho, which may intimidate some hs
students, but very readable and an eye-opener.

There's also _Labor's Untold Story_ by Richard O. Boyer and Herbert M.
Morais, (published by the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of
America, New York,  1965)  though I don't know if it's still in print.

Maria Damon,

--these three Ali poems turned up in a brief web search--none specifically
attached to either of the Liston fights, though.

Got _Dark End..._ already--other books and articles I haven't read
threaten my already iffy "normal human cerebration" at this late date in
dissertation. If this earns a prize, send only in August after I've
defended. I think I'll go worry about the tone of this mail and how it
impacts my future now...

Cheers,
Keith

For someone, somewhere, to come along
With a better and a different tone.

Thank you, Tom.  But my recollection of your conversation (which we sorely
miss, old chum) suggests you wd do better in a duel of wits with Will to
bat for yourself. But whether you or I. it'll be like shooting goldfish in
a rainbarrel.

I agree re the anecdotal testimony re Allen. (oops! or is it Alan?
Allan? -- George, George Bowering, while you're up, would you go the the
Ginsberg section of my bookshelves, check that out? Thanks George!) Some of
the best reading on the List, in my brief months upon it. The Will part is
not so good--would be better if he were on the list I think. I know I
posted re-him, but I was one over the eight that night & forget what I
wrote.

If it cd now be regarded as vitriol-free, I'd like to continue the naming
of contributors to the Don Allan Anthology (or Apology). How abt Jackson
McLow, Michael Mac Lure, Gary Spicer and Jack Snyder? And of course, Jerome
Rothenburg.

in a recent post (i forgot who) someone stated that young people seem
interested/more interested in labor issues communism etc . . . and i
think that although i am somewhat concerned at the willful forgetfulness
of younger generations about critical histories--feminism in
particular--i think its great that individuals are attempting to bring a
more radical edge to the mainstream: watching rage against the machine on
mtv the other day i saw a new video about mexican/migrant workers that
was very in your face.  not that i like everything they do/say but i
admire their efforts to educate/entertain.

well it's spring anyway (despite the weather we've been having here in the
midwest), so it's as good a time as any to note some books recently rec'd,
by poetics list members (you're all such a prolific lot!), all of which
i've only dipped into thus far and all of which look to be well-worth the
price of admission:

first, to second patrick's acclaim, aldon nielsen's _stepping razor_...

doug barbour's _story for a saskatchewan night_...

mark scroggin's (ed) _upper limit music_...

aldon nielsen's (slow down will ya?!) _black chant_...

marjorie perloff's _wittgenstein's ladder_...

linda russo's _constellation voice_...

bob perelman's _the marginalization of poetry_...

walter lew's (ed) _premonitions_...

pierre joris's translation of celan's _breathturn_...

& not from this list region (i think!):

joseph duemer's _static_...

johanna drucker's _the visible word_...

carolyn heilbrun's bio, _the education of a woman:  the life of gloria
steinem_...

finally, i finally picked up my own copy of whitman's _specimen days &
collect_, and am browsing through (whitman is always stimulating reading
for me)...

anyway, whew!... you guyz & galz are incredible!...

Hank, I agree

The newspaper obit you mention -- the "personality-not-a-poet" line --
don't you think that argument was structured into initial reception of
"New American W" itself -- both the 1960 anthology & the moment those
poets occupied in so timely a way, AG included? I think it's clearly there
in Robert Pack's intro to his edited section of New Poets from England and
America--the retrenchment response (1962?) to the Allen antho. If you get
media attention and use the media as AG did, then you are automatically
disqualified as a poet. It's an argument that ironically for the newspaper
journalist puts poetry back into a gown, no longer in the town, where it
can be equally scorned by an identical sort of reporter as decorative
timelessness much like Wedgewood.

Reading backwards through the last week's post,
Louis

For those with an interest in the choice
facing the current electorate in the UK,
note that tens of thousands of mostly
(but by no means all) younger people
marched in London yesterday.

Most prominent of the banners were
those reading

FUCK MIDDLE ENGLAND
FUCK THE ELECTION
TONY BLAIR WE ARE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE

one favorite wore a red vest

He wrote a long piece, of which that was a line or the title - I forget -
an amazing poem decades ago, Keith Waldrop was a member of the Society,
and I joined - one had to reference him out of context...

And I wondered if anyone else had come across his writing.

A nice text for secondary ed and beyond is the _Who Built America?
Working People & The Nation's Economy, Politics, Culture & Society_ in
two volumes from the American Social History Project at CUNY. The
founder of the project is Herbert Gutman. The 'text' can also be had on
CD with lots of pedegogically provocative pictures, songs etc. for the
multi-media prepared computer.

I've used this in teaching literacy classes because of its explicit
historical/political editorial commitments and general accessibility.

Louis, the Hall Pack Simpson anthology _New Poets of England & America_
came out in 1958, preceding the Allen by nearly two years. There may have
been a later edition, post - Allen, that incl. one or 2 of the Allen
poets - Creeley? But HPS were there firstest, though not with the mostest.
Frost did the intro, all the poets were under 40 (they'll be under 80,
today), & they wrote like, well, like Ur-Neo-Formalists. Some handful went
on to fame and considerable fortune. Kingsley Amis, Robert Bly, Donald
Davie, Thom Gunn, Hall himself, Anthony Hecht, Geoffrey Hill, John
Hollander, Elizabeth Jennings, Donald Justice, Philip Larkin, Robert
Lowell, James Merrill, W.S.Merwin, Howard Nemerov, Adrienne Cecile Rich,
Jon Silkin, W.Dewitt Snodgrass,May Swenson, Reed Whittemore, Richard Wilbur
and James Wright, names to conjure with & not any list of mere retrenchers.


It was remarkable to those of us just entering the scene to have 2
anthologies purporting to present the best of current american poetry
coming out, with not one poet in both books. These days, of course, we are
accustomed to such divisions.

Hope this helps, Louis. db

On this subject _A Contoversy of Poets_, edited by Robt Kelly and I forget
whoall, was an attempt either to bridge the gap or to mark the boundaries.
As I remember, Kelly chose the poets from the establishment side, his
conventional poet coeditor chose the poets I like to read. It's a
half-interesting book.

T'was the other way around, Mark, unless Mac Low, Blackburn, Blaser,
Dorn, Enslin, Leroi Jones, Gerrit Lansing, Levertov, Olson, Oppenheimer,
Rochelle Owens, Rothenberg, Zukofsky are the establishment poets, while
Peter Burr, Peter Davison, Donal Finkel, Anthony Hecht, Daniel Hoffman,
Galway Kinnell, XJ Kennedy, Laurence Lieberman, Robert Pack, WD
Snodgrass, Robert Sward etc. are the poets you like to read.

I've been an evesdropper on this list for about 8 months or so, and I feel
compelled to chime in and also to introduce myself... Herb Levy's comment
touches close to home.

When I finished up my undergraduate degree in English almost three years
ago, I felt a big void in my education.  I felt that I'd been introduced to
work, poetry and fiction, representative of what is academically "embraced"
and that the bulk of what I had studied for the past four years was not
contemporary work.  I am saying this even though I understand that a big
goal of the curriculum in English depts. is to give students an historical
grounding of literature.  I would never trade in this education.  But
still, I questioned the relevance of what I'd been told to read.  I felt
that the contemporary work I'd become acquainted with through my classes
was not "dangerous writing" and I felt that that the selection of work took
on an academic cast because there was such a narrow selection of writers.
Somehow when I looked at my bookshelf and the bookshelves of other English
majors at other colleges, I saw the same books, books that were supposed to
be on the bleeding edge of creative writing. How could we all be reading
the same books?  Could they really be that alternative or different or more
importantly "contemporary," if most universities were teaching the same
authors.  I wondered how a silent consensus could have formed about who the
important writers of today are.  Isn't a canon of contemporary writers a
contradiction.  It would be easy for an aspiring writer or a reader who
aspires to understand the tone of contemporary writing to just accept these
people and look to them as the thematic (moral) and styllistic voice of our
time.  What's worse is to accept the opposite condition of this, that
perhaps it's very difficult today to stumble upon a relevant writer who
enjoys obscurity as a result of work that breaks so radically from what's
taught in the university system, or worse still, that it's impossible
because they don't exist.

I felt estranged from what I'd just gotten a degree in.  This bothered me
enough that I decided I would produce and host a radio show about poetry,
literary fiction and performance and fill in the gap.  The format is open,
but usually the guests read their work for the bulk of the program and the
discussion is on the climate of creative writing and not on an analysis of
the particular pieces they've just read.  The best part for me is that good
writers recommend good writers and are so excited to share them.  Also
coming across people with interesting work, but who don't have any
immediate aspirations to publish, ie. closet writers.  I feel as though I
can now make the connection between what I've gotten academically with the
diversity of what I've encountered.  And I can now be thankful for the
survey classes and Norton Anthology for giving me a body of work to relate
it to.

I've also made it a point to educate myself on what the media coverage for
the arts is like.  I'm in Los Angeles so I can only speak for Los Angeles.
I think the climate has changed in the past few years and that arts and
literary programs broadcasting to Los Angeles are breaking out of the
after-midnight airtime ghetto.  For the first year, I had an 11 PM to 2 AM
weekly timeslot.  Now I am on at 8 PM.  At other public stations, we had
Wanda Coleman at KPFK doing Poetry Connection also at 8 PM.  KCRW out of
Santa Monica College has Michael Silverblatt hosting Bookworm during the
day!  2 PM.  KCRW has also made the full broadcasts of his shows available
for download at their website (www.kcrw.org) and the sound quality is fine.

I think there is a growing public demand for arts programming and an
awareness of the radio's and internet's potential to meet that.  Part of
this is due to independent publishing houses putting out spoken word
releases and these getting into Virgin Megastore and the like.  A small
non-profit experimental audio group in New York called Tellus/Harvestworks
which puts out recordings like those of Paul Bowles and John Cage and
Shelley Hirsh is now at my local record store.

The internet will certainly improve public access... it's convenient.  I
don't know how long this particular list has been around, but I sure would
have welcomed it five years ago.  A radio show, an e-mail list, streaming
audio, they can do wonders.

I don't quite follow this thread. Have "the schools" ever provided
information to students about the labour movement, radical political
movements, feminism, vegetarianism, spitritualism? Certainly not in my
experience (50s and 60s). The closest we ever got was one class in the
9th grade that mentioned the merging of the AFL and the CIO. Like sex
and drugs, you've always had to find out about that stuff on your own,
haven't you? Unless you grew up in a family where it was part of your
family values.

Where it seems to me to get really dicey is in the open rewriting of
events like the Viet Nam war. I remember in the early 80's reading in
a high school text book in Santa Cruz, California, that the war was
"started" by an unprovoked attack by North Viet Namese on American
ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. And that the heroic American resistance
was led by Paul Bunyan and his blue ox, Babe.

LAST CHANCE    !!CALL FOR PAPERS!!

Conference: Cross-Cultural Poetics
Dates: October 16-19, 1997
Place: University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Campus
Keynote Speakers: Kamau Brathwaite, Diane Glancy, Dennis Tedlock,
                        Kirin Narayan, David Antin

Despite artificial disciplinary barriers, ethnographers & poets have in
recent years come to realize how similar their projects are.
Cross-Cultural Poetics seeks to address the increasingly untenable
boundaries between poetic & ethnographic practices.  The conference will
focus on the role of poetry in the on-going discourses of multiculturalism,
ethnography, and literary theory and practice.  While recent years have
seen a debate in "how culture is written (about)" and most of these debates
make extensive use of the term "poetics," poetic discourse itself has not
been foregrounded in these debates.  Construing the term "poetry" fairly
broadly, we invite poets and scholars working in a broad range of fields --
anthropology, urban studies, ethnic studies, folklore, literature and
literary theory, sociology, history, publishing, film, American studies,
performance studies, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, etc. -- to propose
readings, papers or panels that address the topic of cross-cultural
poetics.  the following are suggested topics, but you need not feel limited
to them:

- Comparative Poetries &/or Poetic Traditions
- Oral/Literate Interfaces or Standoffs
- Anthropological Methodologies Applied to Poetic Texts, Communities,
Events, or      Individual Poems or Poets
- Ethnography as Poetry/Poetry as Ethnography
- Ethnic, Folkloric & Vernacular Poetries
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Praxis
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Critique
- Constituting Communities through Poetic Activity
- Poetry as Mass Culture
- Poetry & the Public Sphere
-Poetry and Politics
- The Anthropology of Writing & the Writing of Anthropology
- Representing Self/Other
- Issues in Cultural Translation
- "Ethnopoetics": Reappraisals?
- Poetry & Other Media (Song Lyrics, Music, Film, Movement, Visual Arts, etc.)
- Close Readings of &/or Listenings to Ethnographic Documents
- The Poetics of Thick Description
- Ritual, Play, etc. as Elements in Poetic Composition
- The Act of Inscription: Fieldnotes, Notebooks, etc.
- The Cultural Migration of Texts
- Hybridization of Genres & Traditions
-Trans/post/supra national Poetix?

PAPERS (and Writing Samples for people wanting to read) AND PANEL PROPOSALS
(a 1-2-page abstract) should be sent by April 15, 1997 to Maria Damon,
English Dept., 207 Lind Hall, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis MN
55455.

yes, this one is definitely worth a peek.
it's worth noting that zinn, who teaches
at boston university, has suffered more
than a bit for his political practice. a few
years back, president silber (who has
now left the univ. for a prominent position
in MA public ed--talk about frightening),
in what is probably the most recent, &
most prominent instance of the university
administration's usually quiet campaign
against zinn & the left in general, tried to
have him fired when, refusing to cross
the picket line of the then-striking clerical
workers, zinn held his classes off campus.

If you read my posts you will notice that I did not address you.  I
addressed several "fuck-you" posts from the list.

Mabe you should go back and reread those posts before you begin accusing me
of being symathetic with Gearge Will. Yours is a very fascist response,
cruel and totalizing in an attempt to voice a pathetic and deluded sense of
frustration at my Will/Ginsberg comments.  In the future I suggest a LITTLE
forethought and attention in your replies.

Speaking of "ugliness... risen in our time" -- I think it would only be fair
to give George Will his choice of weapons. George, my second Pat Pritchett
will be in touch with your second.

Should George choose pistols, I'll insist on cap. Should he choose wit, I'll

By George, a truer word was never said, old boy.  I was chatting with
Lawn Tennison over a bit of cricket by the hearth just the other p.m.
The pocky old bard was bemoaning his beloved Hal, as usual.  I said
to him, "try some of this, old chap".  "What ho, a new port?" says he.
"No such thing as a new port," pshawed I. "No, it's a bit of that
rawther rambunctious poet, G.M. Hopkins. Wild, wild, wild versical exp-
perimentation, I must say.  See what you think."  The old boy took the
volume, but I'm afraid I haven't heard anything more since -
believe he doddered off to sleep before having a good look at it.

The disaster I was thinking of was the disaster of complicit silence.
By taking a stand in the public light, Allen Ginsberg and others helped
move many people from a position of passivity to one of also taking a
stand, in non-violent acts such a draft-card burning, etc. Your point is
well taken from the standpoint of social outcomes, and the current
social reality..My concern is: how
will we move out of a position of passivity today? Especially
without Allen Ginsberg to lead. I feel that this makes his loss
especially heavy. Thank you for your clarifying response.On Mon, 14 Apr

I say old boy, you might consult the 1846 OED on the term "fascist" - this is
entry #37:  FASCIST(adj.): one who accuses others of "fascism" in a blithe,
freewheeling, & fithergildering manner.

While I agree that _People's History_ is good, it does suffer from its
strength. That is, the birds-eye view narrative of the 'people's
history'. Yet along the lines of your anecdote, Zinn's memoir _You Can't
be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times_ published
in '94 is, I think, more engaging as it narrates from a Zinn's-eye view
as it were. While perhaps memoir-as-genre has blurred into the cliche
excesses of an unrequited romance with a unitary subjectivity, Zinn
stears clear of the pits of irony, bathos, the cynical and
golden-age-ism.
More, it is the narrative of how a political engagement with the world
is precisely that which calls into being one's subjectivity.

Indeed, (to make another connection---perhaps of 'threads') it is not
much of a stretch and  not without benefit to see the paths of Zinn and
Ginsberg as quite similar. Roughly contemporaries traversing much of the
same geographic and psychic space of the american imperium of the 20th
century; steadfast in their fuck-you's; living without regrets for their
engagements with the world; and damanding a different future through
their work and their very bodies. Of course they speak in different
tongues. But tongues perhaps scrawled on the same rosetta stone.

This totalizing "we" is problematic to me.  Personally, Ginsberg never lead
me anywhere (even though I had a poster of him on my bedroom wall when I
was in high school)--and I think his influence is marginal to large
"marginal" populations.  As I see it, he embodied alienation for a bunch of
white guys (and a few women such as Maria D.), a fine thing to do--but
other people have embodied that for other groups and will continue to.

Dear Fellow List Members:

As has been the pattern for  the past two years, the SEND button on my Mail
program responds with a shock of ambiguity each time I touch it & post to
the Poetics List.  Successive efforts don't deaden the nerves; in fact, the
sensation consistently grows more painfully apparent.  One way I have found
to counter this negative impact is a smaller group correspondence--a "sub"
poetics list, where the talk is considered amongst friends--even those I
haven't yet met in person.

And valuable as smaller groups are, I still find great value in the larger
list--more voices in the room: disparate, redundant, informative,
entertaining, illuminating, drab & trite. This List still has plenty of
promise and potential to fill as a powerful resource in the arts community.
I would much rather hear of Allen Ginsberg's failing health from Charles
Bernstein than from an Associated Press release--not to mention a news
column from GFW. I would rather hear about who read in San Francisco over
the weekend from Steve Carll than . . . than what? -- you either hear it
from Steve (or Kevin) or you don't hear it.

My original "reply" to Will's column was an outburst-- a parody of his own
writing on AG--- a catharsis, fun, meant to shame GFW (for what that's
worth) more than to invite serious discussion on how the media reacts to
poetry, etc. etc.  I think that saying "Fuck George F. Will" at the end
(NOT "Fuck you George Will"-- there is a difference) is a rather standard
(and fitting) epigram.

And finally, while I am aware that some of my posts have pissed off many
people on the List, I will remind you that I have not (and do not)
engage(d) in name calling.

This is the most serious note I have ever posted.

May God forgive me, if She remembers my name.

I do apologize for the fascist remark.  But I don't use that word lightly,
as you, Gould, suggest.  As you so adroitly suggest, there are many
definitions to the word.  What we have at times on this list is more like a
high school gang of creeps posturing and screaming at one another.  I was
under the impression that this list was open to dialogue and conversation.
Not totalitarian exegesis (Bouchard) slandering the intentions of those who
post critical comments to the list.  I didn't realize there's no space for
dissenting opinions.

to go fuck hisself f2f... i know---that's really another matter...

still, if it were up to me, i'd like to say it very casually, in front of a

hi dodie, i certainly see your point and have no desire to add to the sense
of totalizing. ag did mean a lot to me, but i'm certainly aware that he
didn't have that significance for others....

Q: Do you work on one poem at a time, or do you work on several at once?
Or do you just write, and make poems from the writing later? I suppose
this will seem naive, but I wonder if there are poets who do not begin
work on a new poem until they have finished the poem at hand --

This tread reminds me of last month when Simon Pettet came over for pizza
and it seemed to me (though this is far from accurate) that every other
word out of his mouth was "fucking," and I felt so jealous because in my
life I'm simply not allowed to talk that way.  One of those reasons why my
writing is so vital for my survival.

Yeah, me for one. Very rarely move on until I'm done. Though sometimes in
the middle an idea for another appears, or a section I take out might begin
to germinate like a cutting. But I finish the first one first, just make a
note alongside so as to remember. sp

i love this question. i've been thinking about my writing process and how
it (inevitably?) mirrors my life. in life i have to consciously stop my
self from doing more than one thing at a time, starting one project and
then starting another in the middle of the first project. and i don't
always stop my self from doing this. and the same thing happens in writing.
and i think it is the same process. i start a piece of writing and if it's
flowing i will continue. if it's not i may start up another project. i
think this is very different than when i was in my 20's and seems to have
to do with my state of mind and state of leisure. i had more leisure time
in my 20's than i do now at 38. but what role does age play in this
separate from leisure time? don't know. i suspect that it does play a role.
maybe i'm becoming more scatterbrained (i love that word) with age.

if you check out my web page you will find two prose projects stalled ("The
Crystal Lava" a translation of Hammett's THE GLASS KEY and "The Profanity
of the Lambs" which is a reworking of some god-awful Harold Robbins novel
or other). and they've been stalled for quite a while. and i haven't put on
the web another prose re-working, this one from R.L. Stine's GOOSEBUMPS
series for kids--THIS IS GRADE A MONSTER SOUP! i think i've titled it.
stalled, stalled, stalled.

still, i also have works that i've worked straight through without starting
another work. but i do not have any rules about not starting another work
until a certain work is finished. i'd love to hear from people who do have
that rule. intriguing.

I suppose there may be, but for many, I can imagine that not beginning a new
poem until the poem at hand is finished would mean that far fewer poems get
written, and perhaps that the spontaneous creation process would be frustrated.
Of course, this begs the question of when a poem is actually "finished."

I work on one at a time--
how's that for scintillating discourse: "me, too".
that's ok, / I never wanted to be "scintillating" anyway.
too dangerous. actually I like the sylvester's "cuttings"--
my work does seem to splinter outward in that way,
so that fragments occur in mid-piece which then go
on to engender other work. actually I'm making it up.
I'm not a writer I'm a brush salesman--2 of them, I'm
2 brush salesmen. & lots & lots of stuff falls on the
floor around my desk, never to be seen again.

1 at a time because if I'm writing one
and put it aside to work on another
that suddenly occurs, it stays aside.
I keep all the poems begun but not continued
in various folders with the promise of returning
to them. But I have never done that so far.
But then there is no fast and hard rule
(perhaps I'm too young, perhaps not
observant enough)--rather I am recently
suprised at how consistently different
the process of writing each poem is: some
go from beginning to end, straight through,
like what working on a musical score must be,
then the next ones get together all ass
backwards like a collage--some I can never
go back to after two days work on them
and for better or worse (the latter) that
is as done as they get. Then
the next one will seem to require just
a little work once a day for a month.
In that whole time I won't work on anything
else unless a) I don't really take it
seriously or b) I don't like the present
project and am willing to sacrifice it.

For quite a few years I fought to maintain
a schedule and regular writing practice, but
that seems to increase frustration and never
produced more work of higher quality, just
more work. (Which is important too, in a way.)
So now I write only when I *really* want to
and by default only work on one thing at a time.

I always write completely off the cuff.

What do others do?

ok

remember, if you use the washing machine as icebucket--clean it
out afterwards.

[threadshift]

I took D. Bouchard's fuck GW as imperative--and so I sent will a
'fuck-you,' a noun, a written remonstrance without, in this case, the word
'fuck.' --that'd be bad rhetorical game, eh, GW'd win. And we can't have
that. How long you think before GW and the sunday breakfast crowd hear too
much poetry and, having learned a valuable lesson from Allen G., find
someone to market, some voice acceptable to the academy, something we can
call traditional to draw those crowds, sell those tickets--the beast, I
think, has already been to Bethlehem.

Allen G scared GW and ilk--his poetry had the rhythm necessary to carry a
catalog of disaster home to America's doorstep...sit there...love that
doorstep...till somethin' human came out the door. I don't hear America
singing but when I read some of you folks 'round here I
hear/see/taste/consume a language that brings it home. Look MA! Left and
postmod--no hands!

But y'all couldn't make generous assumptions about my send-a-fu-to-GW
post--in emotional haste and in bad form I posted w/out introductions.
Keith here. Found this list a little while ago--and was overwhelmed to
hear names/ideas chatted up that are privately familiar and well-chewed.
As when you (you?) ask for Brave Combo in the record store and the
clerk knows who you're talking about and introduces you to her complete
collection including bootlegged tapes made at the Lewisville TX county
fair, 1986. That recognition. That fear and delight.  That gum-popping
pause.

Regardless of how you feel about f---, I'm happy to sit here and listen
to conversation that feels right from voices I trust by reputation or have
started to get an ear-for-here. Nice place--arguments and all. Wish I had
found it earlier.

As a multi-unanthologized poet well past forty, I wondered what the
group's consensus might be on the editorial sensitivity of the Hall Pack
Simpson and Allen anthologies: do you think any consequential poets of
the time were omitted from both?  I could only think of one, quickly:
Robert Lax.  Allen skipped him again in 1982, and so did the recent
Norton Postmodern.                                     --Bob G

no they dont youre right.  and yes we do have to find it on our own.  but
i think what i was responding to was the desire for a more polyphonic
political discourse:  more channels more choices more alternatives.  the
aspect this thread straggled from was wills dissing ag and the desire for
some r e s p e c t (to the tune please) for those willfully purged
alternatives that ag might represent.  mb you are quite right: but cant i
hope that political and cultural opposition be granted its token role in
a dialogic community?  rather than mercilessly and ritualistically
vomited from the body/politic?  naive yes i know.  sometimes it happens.
then i go back to doing the same thing to "theM."

On several at once. While new poems/fragments/work is being handwritten
into notebooks, older stuff (there's a several weeks, sometimes several
months lag between the hand & the keyboard) is being typed up, then
printed, then revised & keyed in again. As a book takes shape more
reworking is being done from the perspective of the book. Simultaneously
it often happens that a given work, older or newer, gets retooled,
expanded/contracted, for specific purposes beyond the writing desk --
i.e. right now taking off on an older piece as it is proving to be the
matrix for generating a text to be performed with dancers & music by an
electronic composer. It seems important to me to permitp the work to
stay in flux, nomadic, in that way -- or some of it, the most open, as
much simply comes & is & remains what it is.

yes Chris,  the Wieners reading...

for me was fantastic.  was the first time i saw him read.  There was
quite a lineup of readers before him,  which gave us all (about 30 people
or so) the opportunity to observe John as he is,  an angel caught between
two worlds. He ferreted through various papers and books he had in a
large dingy bag he carried,  subvocalized and laughed at points,  to what
only he knew,  and wandered through several books from a bookshelf behind
him.  This provided interesting counterpoint to the criticism and poems
being read in his honor.  At points he tuned in to a humorous phrase from
one of the
speakers,  or a curious pause from Charles Shively (who himself read from
a very interesting and involved review/memoir/prosepoem of the printing
of Wieners' book (i think it was _From Behind the State Capitol_...or the
Collected) that was printed in an issue of _FagRag_.

John's reading seemed to exemplify exactly what he has stated as being his
poetic project,  that his life would be the source of his poetry,  that
he could somehow blur the boundaries of life and art.  He began reading from
his newly published journals,
_707 Scott Street, for Billie Holiday_,  and it seemed at first that the
text was unfamiliar to him.  (For those of you who don't know,  Wieners
has had a long history of mental illness,  and his current diagnosis is
schizoprenia.) He paused at points,  and jumped around the text.  He then
opened a large tome which i assumed was his Collected Poems (i've never
seen it).  From this point on one could never be sure where one poem
ended and the next began.  At one point John read from a small strip of
paper,  almost to himself,  the address of some hotel.  At another,  he
unfolded an oversized piece of paper crammed with words,  read a line or
two,  paused uncertainly,  put it away and opened up a book.  His sharp and
self-conscious wit emerged
at points,  as when in the midst of ferreting through his papers he
said,  "I am not a fetishist," eliciting much laughter from the
audience.  It was quite amazing,  a seemless flow of
living art,  complete immersion in himself and the moment.  After about
twenty minutes,  he
abruptly said,  "I think that's all for now,"  and finished. bless him.

p.s. thanks Josh for posting that notice.  I wouldn't have known about the
reading without it.  Keep 'em coming!

fraternitas,

Event went wonderfully, a bigger audience than usual, John was patient
enought of sit thru everyone's welcome, well, maybe an hour or so of
introductions.  Charley Shively, if someone is not familiar with him,
gives beautiful readings.  John read for about 20 mins, poems read with
clippings, ads, other poems, notes on envelopes.  We have the whole event
video stocked.  I think we are planning to collect the papers and
transcribe the rest for some act of not forgetting.  John, btw, is
feeling better, can read and enjoy new audiences, can still floor and
flush any audience, and has a good deal of confidence to pace himself.
Alan Davies spoke some and read the next day, catching me offguard with
his sparer serial lyrics, more like zen in the wake of haste. Bob
Perelman, Louis Cabri, and Rachel Blau DuPlessis, all on this list, all
gave great talks, opening straight into the issues of insanity, embodying,
sexuality.  The evening was instense and a pleasure.  Hopefully these
sorts of events will find him more comfortable with a public, keep us
reading him, keep him hoping and publishing (there are still piles of
journals and unpublished poems).

Christine Palma,

I love radio.  I've done programming and fund-raising for community
stations on & off for fifteen of the last twenty years.  It's a great
medium, full of amazing potential, but all-too-often this potential is
unrealized and in general this situation is getting worse.

Christina, you're VERY lucky to live in an area in which you not only have
a good Pacifica station, but also community stations like KCRW which
haven't entirely bought into the NPR model of narrowing the program content
to widen the audience size.  The areas around New York (hi Kenny) & San
Francisco are similarly blessed.  The rest of us in the States get very
spotty service from our "public" broadcasters in terms of adventurous arts,
poetry or otherwise.

Most radio stations who broadcast stories about Ginsberg's death hadn't
presented Ginsberg's work on the air (if they ever had) since the multiple
CD boxset of recordings was released and, hence, newsworthy.  How many
radio stations regularly broadcast poetry with roots in the experimental
tradition?  How many broadcast such poetry mainstreamed within their
regular programming, rather than in a specialty program aired a few hours
every week or once or twice a month?  How many broadcast ANY poetry (even
mainstream crap) at ANY time?

In general "public" stations in the States are focusing more on increasing
their market share and less on serving diverse underserved communities.
The result is homogenous & bland "classical" (no vocal music, no weird
contemporary music, just oceans of pretty music), "jazz" (nothing weird,
please, what would Wynton say, & often nothing old enough to not be in
stereo), or "alternative pop" music (the oxymoronic label says it all, if
it doesn't a drum kit and an electric guitar forget about it) stations.
"Public" stations are dropping specialty programs, focusing on a specific
format,  and coverage of all but the most mainstream events is declining,
cause they might alienate those folks in the upscale demographic that the
station's advertisers (oops, I mean underwriters) pay to reach throughout
the day.

That these stations ARE often better than the other media in a given area,
is more a sign of how bad the other media have become, rather than how
great these stations really are.

There are still many wonderful individuals involved in public, and
especially community, radio (we can't do without them & they deserve all
the support we can give them), and isolated stations even outside of major
markets can be quite good, but increasingly every non-mainstream interview
or feature has to be justified, usually by tying it to a product or event.

Even with this kind of tie-in, this stuff is rarely distributed nationally
and is almost never actually produced by NPR.  The vast majority of
adventurous programming available for stations via satellite is
independently produced by folks who must rent satellite time from NPR for
distribution, & then most stations don't broadcast it anyway.

How many people on this list heard LINEbreak, the radio series produced by
Charles Bernstein & Martin Spinelli, on a radio station in their area?
Martin, do you know how many stations aired the series?  For thaat matter
how many programs have been downloaded how many times from the EPC Web
site?

Christina, it sounds like what you're doing is cool, but most of us don't
have this range of radio options where we live.

I've really got to go finish up some other folks taxes now, talk to you later.

Bests,

Herb

Subject:      Is anybody still discussing Bob Perelman
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Susan Schultz' take in the new WITZ on Bob Perelman's
MARGINALIZATION OF POETRY led me back to that text again with some
questions I'm still trying to figure out. On the one hand, can someone
explain to me where exactly Bob, in distinguishing Charles Bernstein as
"envisioning a group of textual enclaves as standing in for politics" and
Kamau Braithwaite as creating a poetry leading to the possibility of new
alternative "nations," obviously priveleges Braithwaite's project over
Bernstein's? I keep looking for that but am not seeing it--can someone
point me to what I'm missing? Is it in the idea that Bernstein's attempt
to refigure language intends to function on an "anarchic" level that can't
(according to Perelman) reach outside the academic context, whereas
Braithwaite's is seeking a more broad-based constituency? I would disagree
with that reading if Bob is making it, but I can't quite find the sentence
where he directly states that this IS his argument.

        Actually, one problem I do feel like I'm having with THE
MARGINALIZATION OF POETRY is the way in which Bob seems to be reducing the
various purposes of the poetry of Bernstein, Braithwaite AND Andrews to
their function SOLELY as ideological critique--he seems, at times, to be
arguing that there's NO element of their poetry not focused on offering
ideological critique. He seems to be reducing the variety of this work to
various means of "storming the capitol." Furthermore, am I right in
thinking that he comes dangerously close to seeing the work of these
writers as having a SINGULAR CENTER--Bernstein wants "textual anarchy,"
Braithwaite wants "alternative nation states," and all of Andrews' work is
a complete assault on any possibility of identity? Interesting on this
subject is Jeffrey Nealon's DOUBLE READING: POSTMODERNISM AFTER
DECONSTRUCTION. Nealon takes a number of academic critics to task (George
Hartley among others) for not reading the POETRY of language poetry (in
all its potential multiplicity, ambiguity, and contradiction) but instead
trying to reduce all the poets involved to a single cultural critique
which they are all engaged in. Curious then (if my reading here is even
partly correct) that Bob, who is a poet also, should seem at least in part
to be engaging in this same kind of reduction (language poetry is simply
MAKING A SERIES OF POINTS about social reality, POINTS WHICH CAN THEN BE
EVALUATED ON WHETHER THEY ADD UP TO A SINGULAR CORRECTNESS.

        Susan Schultz' essay is interesting also for noting that Perelman
lumps a number of women poets associated with language poetry into the
same chapter; Schultz sees Perelman being more sympathetic to their
practice on the one hand, while possibily ghettoizing it (and certainly
keeping it something of a side issue) at the same time, and she asks for
the motivation for that placing.

        So, my questions are these: are there places where Perelman is not
as singularly judgemental (Braithwaite over Bernstein) as he seems? Or is
the heart of the book an attempt to reduce the variability of poetic
practice to a singular, centered ideological critique, and to see its
various subjects as falling short because they finally have a limited
singular center? But what if they were not intending to have such a
center? What if poetry is not ONLY ideological critique by other means?

Gee, I'd have to agree with William Burmeister, who seems dead on for me:

"I suppose there may be, but for many, I can imagine that not beginning a new
poem until the poem at hand is finished would mean that far fewer poems get
written, and perhaps that the spontaneous creation process would be frustrated.
Of course, this begs the question of when a poem is actually "finished."

Bill B"

Also, what Don Cheney said about loss of leisure time. So I write as mucha
s I can of a poem at a time, but also find larger series are begun & then I
may or may not keep at them in tandem, & at whatever times

Dear Daniel Bouchard:

It seems to me that this message was/is meant to intimidate anyone who may

Mocking someone's name?  (see below)  I do not think that Dale was

Will you mock my name?  Will you write that I am defending George Will?  Do you

What a nice query! I've been writing in series for so long that I don't
know anymore what an individual or occasional poem looks like -- this has
been going on for almost eight years now -- the demands of the sequence
dictate what comes next, so I could be (and am) working on three or more
at once -- plus constant journal scribbling, which more often than not
yields the raw material . . .

Lovely to talk about the how, as well as the what . . .

literary journal Randstad in 1964:

It all started twenty years past
The greatest of them all was born at last
The very first words from his Lousville lips,
'I'm as pretty as a picture and there's no one I can't whip.'
Then he said in a voice that sounded rough,
'Im as strong as an ox and twice as tough.'
The name of this champ, I might as well say,
No other than the greatest, Cassius Clay.
He predicts the round in which he's gonna win
And that's the way his career has been.
He knocks them all out in the round he'll call,
And that's why he's called the greatest of them all.

i warm up, often, by editing/revising a poem in progress, and then start
working out a new poem once i'm limber.  always have a number of poems in
revision.
e
ps
if i waited till i'd finished poem at hand i'd never finish anything... i
typically revise something around 35 to 60 times (i.e. re-read and look for
/at problem spots, change/shift, move around, reword)

Usually several at once, but sometimes can get going on one which takes
virtually all the attention for weeks at a time. Most often for the last 6
years each of the "several" is a fairly long work, in sections or not, and
sometimes there's going back and forth within a work. And then someone will
ask for something, and there may be looking through new and old work, and
working on something again. If that someone asking is a choreographer or
video artist, perhaps there will be some attention put to the particular
use and collaboration involved, and perhaps something entirely new will
begin, amid the others already going on. And sometimes there will be a time
when all will cease for a few weeks -- not a block of any kind, more of a
respite, perhaps, or perhaps more attention to making books or reading or
some other act which usually doesn't seem that separate from the poems. And
often books seem to take shape almost from the first conception of a work,
but not always does such a book finally come together. And that brings
about the question of how/when a work "ends," which is another discussion
entirely.

Why yes, indeed. However translation is so, shall we say, unstable.
Therefore, following da Vinci in the Codex Leicester and elsewhere, I
have produced a more adequate method of rendering translation from the
original in this text. That is, hold the text to the mirror, cover your
left eye to occlude the perception of depth and then,
counter-intuitively, read only one letter at a time and all will be made
clear.

Latex is available for those with untranslatable safety concerns.
Further, beyond its prophylactic benefits it has possibilities all its
own for new philological exploration.  Kink, as always, is optional.

I do one at a time and finish it at the same time or scrap it so it's like

Many at a time, plus reviews and essays and journal entries. Poems
come out in spurts. And when the spring dries up, I move on to another
poem.  Almost all of my poems, however, first begin as prose. I notice
that a couple of others write this way and I think I remember that this
is the way that Yeats wrote. I find that this is the best way to get
down what I want to say; almost as if I'm writing a letter to myself to
be read at some point in the future. Having that frame to work in keeps
me to the task far better than setting out to write a poem from scratch,
so to speak. Strangely, or perhaps not, the prose-to-poetry method
results in far less stilted form and language. I can follow the
first-choice, best-choice path with no obscuring of the trail from
rewriting. At least for me, this is what happens. What about others who
write from a prose frame?

cheers,
Steven

Charles, are you referring to a more contemporary song that appropriates from
the Budini Brown heraldry(!?).  And was the Brown piece put up while Ali was
still Cassius Clay? If so, the "Ali" in the more recent song wd be an example
of history re-writ. Tom M., indeed, referred to the song in the time of
 "Muhammed" rather than time of "Clay".
I somehow think of the butterfly/bee combination as part of the Casius moment
- before the religious change.  Except in its awe of the power of language,
within its youthful boast, it's a rhyme that shows little sign of any need
for religio-humility.
I remember being knocked out by it - in the middle of incredible upheaval, it
was so fresh, stood up and cut right thru everything. And then just hung
there -- gem like -- in the air.

I guess one of us shd go out and find 'the book' with the real facts.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

All three.  Am currently writing daily ten line poems (sit down, crank it
out, one or two spot revisions, then move on to the next one).  Also am
constantly tinkering with older stuff, usually after I get 'em back with
rejection slips attached.  I also bring a journal to readings and write
while people read, a combination of what I hear and what I'm thinking
(similar to what Mac Low does).  Chopped, spindled and spliced, this
becomes source material for the rest of my poems.

Bob :  How nice to have insomnia (3 am), wake up, and find myself
addressed on our list.  Of course, one can arrive at the existence of
Allen G by many paths and never to have arrived is worse.  But it is
simply the case that context does limit one's initial understanding of a
person or thing and that the medium by which one discovers a writer,
televison included, can limit or "flatten" one's sense of the whole.  An
interested viewer could replay a video of AG again and again, but sitting
with his work in book form and reading it is another experience, I'd
venture.  Reading allows for a fuller initiation pehaps?

Interesting how many people write many things at once (although even
more interesting all the side comments on composition).  It still
comes down to one at a time for me, until it's finished (although
often come back later & use the needle pliers).
  Why just one at a time?  I can think of 2 reasons: 1st, a poem seems
like an "event" to me - like an occasion or an experience.  2nd
as Isaiah Berlin pointed out, everyone's either a fox or a hedgehog.
& I'm a conehead.
   & that "one" may be just one poem, or a series that
takes months & has me writing in the other room at 3 am. or other
uncomfortable situations.

still no clear answers on the clay/liston fight poem.  here's another quiz
(i desperately need the answer to): what's that line that goes "imaginary
somethings with real something in them" i think the word "toadstools" is in
there somewhere.

Of course, Jeffrey, you can have all the utopian dreams you want.
I was just objecting to a certain "what's wrong with young people
these days, they don't know anything about the IWW or whatever" thread
that crept into this exchange.

Mark Wallace--

I haven't seen Susan's piece yet.  Perelman's book on the other hand was
very interesting and useful to me.  He may respond himself here...But it
seems to me the Marg. of Poetry is not reductive with regard to any given
poet's work.  It suggests tentative areas of engagement and
characterization.  I think Perelman's wish to get at a certain audience
and a certain niche, which involves carefully articulated
academic-sounding anayses, may be mistaken for brusque pigeon-holing.  To
my ear that is not what's going on.  I also feel that as a public figure
at the head of "LangPo, the historical phenomenon" he is determined to
show plenty of skepticism about its claims, where they are weak or
incomplete--thus the emphasis on the limits of certain poets.

However, I agree with the passage I've retained below.  There is a
tendency sometimes (in BP's Marginalization and among other folks) to
assume that a focused cultural and political agenda is the REASON for a
poet doing her particular work.  I had some great backchannel exchanges
with Joe Safdie which involved (as I see it) this problematic assumption.
This crops up in a somewhat different form in Golding's brilliant From
Outlaw to Classic (which I strongly recommend, and which I only heard of
'cause he's on this list and mentioned it in passing)--There he sometimes
suggests that "avant-garde" poetry will lose it's reason for being if it
becomes too accepted institutionally, if it has no "center" or maybe no
right-wing, to respond against.  This seems to be to be putting the
pegasus before the cart...Vital poetry is made (like vital painting, dance
or music) for its own fervid intensity as human activity, involving a
particular physical medium.  It isn't primarily a form of insurgency
against the current cultural hegemonies.  A given poet (;like many on this
list) may be compelled, because of historical junctures, to be in
opposition to those who hold institutional power in the poetry world...But
that isn't why most of us write.  Likewise (it is a different point, but
they **are** parallel) most radical poets are not trying exclusively to
power social change thru verse; many different calculations go into our
choices, and while all are implicated in politics, few are reducible to
it.  As a long-time socialist activist and a poet, I feel each engagement
must be allowed its own set of rooms, its own problematic shape.

mark, in partial reply to your well-put questions:  pp. 93-4, _the
marginalization of poetry_:

"it would be easy enough simultaneously to award the palm to the
revolutionary commitment of _x/self_ and to dismiss bernstein's anarchy.  i
can imagine that a subtle, self-aware, and humorous caliban makes a more
attractive figure for many than a self-shattering "humpty dumpty" ... who
seems to say little more than "words can be spelled however i choose to
spell them."  braithwaite's words exist in history, to the point where a
revolutionary life becomes the embodiment of the verb of saying ... by
extension, the act of writing _x/self_ can be seen as a parallel
revolutionary act.  such a statement, however, requires a major caveat.
"by extension" masks a problem:  the idea of revolutionary writing is based
on a revolutionary reading of it, which in turn is based on the academic
security of intellectual flexibility.  and bernstein, despite his many
gestures of renunciation, also wants power, at least in a more local
academic arena..." (my ellipses)...

i'm not certain the implicit critique here of bernstein's poetic 'position'
vis-a-vis braithwaite's doesn't fudge somewhat (even as it illuminates)
what *appears* to be a privileging of some wider, less "local" (and more
urgent?) "history" somehow implicit in braithwaite's "revolutionary"
impulse... the question would seem to turn on the sort of poetic agency
"embodied" by bernstein and braithwaite (which is not to say "identity")...
how does agency operate in the bernstein readership vis-a-vis the
braithwaite (yes there is overlap, of course)...

but it may be that it's the "revolutionary," in fact, that gives trouble in
this context (an academic context, finally, given that bob's book is on
princeton up, which of course seeps now into poetics---a somewhat more
complicated context)...  i'm thinking of what current notions of
"revolutionary" might entail, readership-wise, as well as
"anarchy"---regarding which i am tempted to say that so many
counter-cultures have been effectively foreclosed upon in the past two
decades (and then some)...

try this on---obliquely, by way of getting 'at' the humor in bernstein (and
really---not an 'apologist' for charles here, just trying to get a handle
on his agency, which may not be a matter merely of presumed "Self"-shatter,
exactly):

"the humor of the oppressed is a funky thing that runs slantwise through
sorrow and self-pity, a funny sideways nuance of irony and self-mockery:
coming out of the black community, descending to from the remains of the
east european yiddish ghettos.  nobody writes 'light verse' any more.  but
there is humor and play and mockery and exaggeration in the most serious
poems.  because if you're trying to write in some way of your whole life
with the whole person ... well, it's pretty absurd.  you have to dig
yourself, your own absurdity." (author's ellipsis)...

it's marge piercy, from "tom eliot meets the hulk at little big horn:  the
political economy of poetry," marge piercy and dick lourie... in
_triquarterly_ no. 23/24, winter/spring 1972, special issue on "literature
in revolution"; p. 89...

Thanks for the plug, but we're still very much in business. We had a
well-publicized 'restructuring' or whatever you call it these days, that
resulted in the ouster of founder and figurehead Bob Stein & the cutting of
the nominal CD-ROM production department. But we're still making CDROMs,
almost as many as last year in fact, including... ta dah!... WBA II. But
don't get too excited, it's not done yet -- in fact I probably shouldn't be
mentioning it.

As for the gay cowboys, it was Apple who tried to drop it from a bundle, we
made a federal case out of it and they backed down. Pretty fun stuff, all
in all (when you win). It might be banned in some high schools, I don't
know -- probably more for the frontier abortionist stuff...

And as for Jordan's question, I've been working on the same piece for 5
years now, trying to find the proper medium for it. I think I've settled on
hypertextual-book length-video-poem. That I'll then print onto a series of
Tshirts. Or something.

Yes, I guess I am, and a pretty bad song at that. I have no idea when the

I'm usually working on two or three, but they're at different

different times.
But what I've also found is that, without planning to, the poem
I'm working on "most" is, almost always, in some way, connected
to the prose piece I'll also be working on. I'm always working
poems and prose at the same time.

I simply meant to imply that in certain ways today our social milieu shares
many traits with those of Victorian England.  The most obvious is the
pervasive social usage of "niceness" as a way to avoid critical dialogue.
Although the surface is pleasant-"that was a nice poem, a nice reading, a
nice (fill in the blank)-hidden hostilities remain directly unspoken.  The
Middle English usage of the word-'foolish'-descended from prior French and
Latin cognates meaning 'ignorant' or 'not knowing.'  It's interesting to
hear 'nice' so over-used in today's contexts.

Also, while today's climate feels more open in certain respects than in the
past, we still live in a market economy narrowly defined by a monopoly of
political, social, and cultural interests.

I feel I'm not being specific enough, however, within this space of e-mail
comminication.  What I've written is too general and I haven't connected to
anything concrete.  My point in writing the post you quote was to learn
what disasters had been spared by 'media revolutionaries.'  I was
addressing Piombino's vague statement with my own.  I'd be happy to
backchannel re: this issue, if you'd like.  I don't think it's worth
wasting much space.  I had Raymond Williams' The Country and The City in
mind when I posted.

Given civilization, artists embody its discontents. Since many institutions
find their stability and perpetuation in suppressing the news of
discontents, there are bound to be conflicts between artists and
insitutions, even where those institutions are largely made up of artists
or of those who would facilitate art. While I'm sweeping generalizations
around,I'll add that art has a shock to it, but that by the time that comes
to be a "shock  va l u e ," we pass from nakedness to The Nude, and
eventually, Dada rests in the Museum, whose calm framing does a lot to
tranquilize shock. I don't like to sound aloof, but I doubt that there's a
whole lot to be done to alter this dynamic, even in a more liberal, open
society than we'll likely see again in my lifetime. Perspective is always
the joker, and poets who work within institutions frequently are nominated
to help out with further institutions, where they learn the value (a real
value!) of compromise, and the way of life this can become must place their
art-selves in considerable jeopardy. Its easier to kid yourself, harder to
find the foul rag-&-bone yard--or blissful indifference--of the heart of
the matter of human being. There might be more, a lot more, to say on this
topic, but on a busy list, it's best, I feel, to keep ostings fairly brief.

I don't think Bob P privileges Brathwaite (that's without an "i" said the
pedant) over Bernstein.  That Bernstein "wants power" goes without saying:  who
doesn't?  As I read it, Bob P's point involves the mediations of the "academy"
to which both writers are more or less subject.  The contrast worth making is
between the (mostly) dispersive energies of CB's practice and the gathering
energies of Brathwaite's.  This contrast is itself made (not in exactly this
way) by CB in his remarks on KB in "Poetics of the Americas."  What would be
worth contesting in Bob P's reading of KB, and also in CB's reading of KB, is
their sense of KB's practice as singular (this is related to mark's point but
not the same point).  I take it that much of X/Self has little to do with
"nation-language" at least as KB has defined it, that there is indeed a
"vernacular" present in the poem and that it is this vernacular that grounds
"nation-language" and the utopian identity politics the poem is imagining. I
take it too that--elsewhere--there is something else going on, more related to
dispersing than gathering.  Caliban as rebel, Caliban as hero:  dispersing and
gathering both.  What Bob P acknowledges but does not to my thinking stress
enough is the Caribbean location of KB's project.  Different issues there than
the ones CB must face.  And when KB's text enters into USAmerican contexts it
is something else.  For a shameless plug I'll mention that I've discussed
some of these issues in an essay in paul naylor's _River City_.

This is too brief, perhaps cryptic, but i've a thousand things to do today. And
anyway as i read Mark the real force of his question to Bob involves matters
other than the remarks on KB and CB.

I would say this is definitely true - at least for me in relation to Di
Prima and her earliest work like Dinners and Nightmares, which seemed much
more interesting to me than any other lit of that period (and still does
to some extent) - and her trajectory through the years has taught me a lot
- just finished rereading Revolutionary Letters though which reifies the
NME to such an extent that HE disappears into monolith and we are always
painted as the good guys and I'm as corrupt as they come, we're all, and
can't identify -

Clay comes out to meet Liston
And Liston starts to retreat
If Liston goes any further
He'll end up in a ringside seat
Clay swings with a left
Clay swings with a right
Look at young Cassius
Carry the fight
Liston keeps backing
But there's not enough room
It's a matter of time
There, Clay lowers the boom
Now Clay swings with a right
What a beautiful swing
And the punch raises the bear
Clear out of the ring
Liston is still rising
And the ref wears a frown
For he can't start the counting
Till Sonny comes down
Now Liston disappears from view
The crowd is getting frantic
But our radar stations have picked him up
He's somewhere over the Atlantic
Who would have thought
When they came to the fight
That they'd witness the launching
Of a human satellite
Yes the crowd did not dream
When they lay down their money
That they would see
A total eclipse of the Sonny
I am the greatest!

what if art is a process.  not automatically a process of discontent.
something else.  & enlisting it in vanguard of discontent/truth-seeking/
rebellion ends up hiding the truth as much as revealing it.  what if
the process leads to a more radical truth if discontent is not taken
as a given (thus leading to all the institutionalized hypocrisies &
comedies DB alluded to). we've had these non-arguments over huge-

A hundred years ago Oscar Wilde -- a writer perhaps even more celebrated in
Victorian England than Allen Ginsberg in postwar America -- was hounded to
death while at the very height of his fame and at the top of his magnificent
form. Allen Ginsberg, and to be sure many others, courageously refused to be
bashed down by the perverts who would end a person's life and career because
of their sexual orientation or lifestyle. He was part of a massive cultural
movement to make what happened to Wilde if not unthinkable at least
unacceptable in the U S of A. He did this not by presenting "positive"
images of being gay or smoking pot but by presenting by turns joyous and
defiant images of these things and a number of others. Wilde ends his days
in jail and then disgrace. Ginsberg is celebrated even in the pages that
reviled him -- the Times, the New Yorker, &c --

I write that not because it is not well known to the people on this list,
but because it bears repeating.

Not to my knowledge. Thomas Hauser's book on Ali is the one to read - an
oral bio. And Ali himself came out with his autobio _The Greatest_. Wilfrid
Sheed has also done a fine photo-essay book on him - prob. out of print. His
poems appear here & there. George Plimpton has a piece about the meeting he
arranged between Marianne Moore and then Cassius Clay - to tie together both
of Maria Damon's recent queries. It's quite amusingly related, as I recall -
but the event, in which they worked together on a poem -  was an
anti-climax, acc. to Plimp.

To an outsider this continues to be very weird. Two of the parties,
Bernstein and perelman, are on the list. Why do we theorize about what one
meant about the other and what the other may think of it? Isn't this like
talking about people in the room as if they weren't there? Why don't we just
query them for their own input?

Mark Weiss's proposition below is not true; rather than the nation, it
characterizes itself. Or, as a mystery bonus allusion for cross-readers of
POETICS and CAP-L, the nation is just what you say -- the world is ugly
and the people are sad.

Pat P. Had the swifter server, but here's another Ali poem on Liston:

This is a story about a man
With Iron Fists and a beautiful tan.
He talks a lot indeed,
Of a powerful punch and blinding speed.

The boxing game was slowly dying,
And fight promoters were bitterly crying
For someone somewhere to come along
With a better and different tone.

Patterson was dull, quiet and sad,
And Sonny Liston was just as bad.
Along came a kid named Cassius Clay,
Who said, "I'll take Liston's title away."

His athletic genius cannot be denied.
In a very short time
He Spread far and wide.

There's an impression you get
Watching him fight.
He plays cat and mouse
Then turns out the light.

This colorful fighter is something to see,
And the Greatest Heavyweight Champion
I know he will be.


And, another variation on the theme of Sonny Liston, shorter and w/ slanter
rhymes.

King Liston will stay
Only until he meets Cassius Clay.
Moore fell in Four, Liston
In eight.


Finally, a poem that resulted in death threats:

Keep asking me, no matter how long,
on the war in Viet Nam, I'll sing this song:
I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong.

Dave Zauhar, mostly quoting Muhammad Ali

Mark --

Sorry about the hostile tone of that last post. Guess I was enacting
exactly what I was criticizing again (whoops!).

But once again to quibble -- does it make sense to speak of outsiders on a
listserv? Seems more like there are readers who indicate that they have
read _by writing back_, and then there are readers who either read and
it's enough, or else they just keep deleting until they see a subject they
like. It is a topic, all right, the anger of poets who are entering a
discussion.

That said, I agree, the rhetoric of posts about list members (and the
subsequent silence) _is_ kind of funny. It's not exactly like watching
bear-baiting... Bob Perelman, doesn't it happen to you every few weeks?

alter this dynamic . . . poets who work within institutions frequently are
nominated to help out with further institutions, where they learn the

Gosh, David, where did this come from? Am I misreading you by seeing this
as a statement of futility, of one's art inevitably coming to nothing, of
tragic (even) melancholy? How are you feeling today?

Compromise is certainly a virtue in faculty meetings and marriages, but I
doubt whether any good poem ever arose out of it. Are you saying that any
poet who works in an institution, MUST, necessarily, give up the poetic
urges, the rag-and-bone shop, of one's art self? And thus compromise? Do
you feel you've done this? Granted, it's unbearably easy to kid one's
self, but if any art I'm lucky enough to create can come only at the
expense of my official duties at this institution or any other -- I'll
quit! I'll let my wife support me! (Just kidding, Sara).

Your post reminded me of Jim Carroll's unjustifiably neglected first
rock-'n-roll album (circa 1980); there's a song on it that has the lyric:

But it ain't no contribution
To rely on the institution
To justify your chosen art
To sanction your boredom
And let you play out your part

(loud guitar strums)


I admire your dictum regarding short posts, but I sure would like to hear
more about this . . .

I've been having difficulty getting my messages bounced back (I hope it's
sorted now) so I'm a bit late with this, but I was reminded when Ginsberg
died of my report to this list of the Albert Hall gig he starred in, in
London, back in Oct 95; I quote myself:

"I find his first poem incredibly moving in its wry, humorous acceptance of
death and dissolution ("What a mess I am, Allen Ginsberg"; "Allen Ginsberg
warns you: don't follow my path to extinction")."

Seems like he saw it coming from way off.

In the midst of a UK general election campaign that is unprecedentedly
dismal in its hypocrisy, cant and soundbite-count, I long for some of that
honesty & humanity.

Mark--

If I want to ask Bob "Hey do you privilege Brathwaite over Bernstein in that
book of yours?" I'll ask him.  Then we'll have a new text I'll come to some
sort of conclusion about.  I was venturing an opinion about part of another one
already published and X/Self itself--in response to Wallace's post.

No bear-baiting involved (hi Jordan, I'm talking about you now, as well as *to*
you but look a few people are listening either way)--just bull.  Asking people
questions directly and out of the blue in this forum--"Hey Bob do you privilege
Brathwaite over Bernstein in that book of yours?"--now that would be strange.
Kind of like writing a review and mailing it to someone with a bill attached,
and a note saying that you must respond now or else.

Sometimes texts authored by members of the list and not the text of the list
itself becomes the object of discussion, no?  Perhaps it is awkward.  Perhaps
it is simply inevitable--after all, you are all so prolific in this electronic
world and beyond it.

        Yes, Joe, I think you're misreading me.

 [under these conditions] ...CONSIDERABLE jeopardy.
         ....It's easiER to kid yourself
          ....It's hardER to find....

This is not "a statement of futility, of one's art inevitably coming to
nothing, of tragic (even) melancholy."

I think your next sentence, "How are you feeling today?" Is ad hominem.

Do I feel I've done this? What, arrived at conclusions you impute to me,
that are not supported by the actual words I used?

I fail to see the parallel between my posting and Jim Carroll's delightful
rock lyrics. There is no guitar strumming in my observations.

Jack Spicer said, and unfortunately my disorderly record-keeping allows
only my paraphrase (and we see how tricky they can be), "the more you know
as a poet, the more furniture there is in the room, the harder it is to get
in and out of it." I only testify from my observations of many careers,
that have institiutionalized themselves with their success. I had never
considered that my own answered to this category. Obviously, "its all
relative." But what powers I have, are my own--there's no leg up I could
give anybody, except to blurb their book.

Tragic? How about Beckett's "I cant go on. I'll go on." That makes more
sense to me. Tragic is compromised with posturings.

Hope this clarifies. db

Speaking of Howard Zinn, does anyone know anything about the New
Party? I saw an ad a couple weeks back where Zinn is listed as a
"member" along with Noam Chomsky, Cornel West, Barbara Ehrenreich,
Jim Hightower, and other prominent others. I've also seen the NP
championed by Alexander Cockburn in the Nation, talking about them
winning a few dozen local elections around thecountry in the past
couple years or so.

What's the history? How does this group differ, say, from the new
Labor Party founded in Philly, or "Nader's" Green party? What would be
the sticking points to overcome before a possible electoral
alliance, for example? (Nader got half a million in only 26 states,
so such unity might have eventual ground-breaking results?) Ten years
ago I could draw a fractal family tree of every little left
splinter group in the country since James Cannon marched out of the
CPUSA politburo singing the Internationale. Now I don't even know
where this glitzy and well-appointed New Party came from. A DSA leap
into third party politics?

I feel left out and don't want the revolution to start without me.

Info Ron Silliman? Mark Presjnar? Curious,

David bromige insists on the seemingly inevitable and continuous
struggle between art and institutions.  Safdie wonders if he is saying
that art is futile.

I sympathize with David's position.  It seems to me that expecting our
poetry to transcend the ideological, material, and social spheres of
institutions and everyday interactions is what is futile.  Placing too
high a demand on poetry, asking too much of it -- the descendants of
Shelley's "poets are the unaknowledged legislators ..." -- makes poetry
futile.  By insisting that it is embedded in the same network/nest of
forces as other activities is to see it more accurately, to recognize
its strengths and weaknesses rather than hoping for what is not there
and ending with futility.

My sense is that most poems come out of implicit, rather than explicit,
compromise. The compromise happened long before the moment of writing,
in the poet's absorbing, thinking about, and coming to terms with the
myriad poetical, social, and institutional forces impinging on him or
her.

To be able to write means to have already compromised, and to have
forgotten.

Christopher (Chris?)

thanks for the heaven's gate found poem.  chilling,  to say the least.
the droning repetition seems appropriate in characterizing a sort of
religious denial.  if one keeps repeating the words,  no other ideas can
get in.

Do I detect a smirk on the end of this critique?  Is this an example of the
iterative function of criticism in a de-centered sensorium?  Or is that just

Could it be said then that from a historical perspective Ginsberg and other
leaders of the 60s represent the dialectical flip-side of American rugged
individualism?  Individual liberty (in terms of "lifestyle") over social
and political "correctness"?  The same movement expressed in different
form in the confessional poetry of the time and the ego styles of the 70s.
Since then, the self and her/his authorial intentions have gone out of
fashion, both on the left and the right.  On the latter we have bland
traditionalist focus on superficialities of technique, on the former
turgid avant-garde focus on superficialities of technique.

Well actually Mark that gets at something which is a real live issue about
this space, and other spaces like it...I don't think cybersocialspace
functions in quite the way you think..I suspect that how it functions is
more in flux and more contested than your post states.  These two are also
widely-known poet/theorists, and the discussion is not about them as
people, but about their published books...I don't believe they should feel
*compelled* to intervene in a discussion of their work, at least not right
away..(they may wanna wait till something really pisses them off ;)...)

There is a constant push and pull between two structures of feeling: that
cybersocialspace is like being in a room in a fairly intimate
conversation, involving maybe half a dozen people; and that on the
contrary it is very public and very widely-scrutinized, and much like
debates and exchanges published on paper on various subjects.  Your post
suggests the former; I personally think that if people reflect for a
minute they'll realize that the truth is closer to the latter idea.  I
think it's great for us to be able to ask CB and BP to respond to what
folks have posted...But frankly I don't think they're obligated to, any
more than they are obligated to respond by letter to every discussion of
their work in a little mag or an academic journal.  Ask 'em, by all means.
But my take on public electro-discussion is, that it is suggesting we
can't discuss their work that is "very weird."  Remember that this is a
public not a highly personal space, no matter what it feels like at
times.

elbow(kind/delicious)into Perelman/Brathwaite/Bernstein chat--

As I read/write my way through Perelman's _Marginalization_, second time
through spur(n)ed by this discussion, it (text in bathrobe) seems an
in-house leftist critique of language writing. joining Andrews _P&M&P&P_
in negotiation of non-essentialist argument for essential political
space.

Perelman's value of Brathwaite over Bernstein is use-value, possibility
instead of danger of reification in Bernstein's "utopian politics of
liberated textuality" (P 90)?

Sidebar: Eagleton's _Illusions of postmod_ seems to allow more room for a
leftist poetmodern poetics than other recent marxist critique-- Perelman's
readerly/writerly distinctions dance well there, I think. Yes?

        Just to say, I tend to be very suspicious
        of found poems because usually they arn't
        really found (but cropped in some way) or
        aren't very good (compared, say, to Antin's)
        but I was
                        shocked by this one! It is very moving, especially
the way the line breaks worked, with the first "second coming" interrupting
the "freedom" line and "extraterrestrial" carrying over into "millennium"
twice--I didn't even need your explanation of the real reason for multiple
words--though I think it contributes to the poem-- the repition reminds me
of prayer, of designating a certain kind of strength to words, a weight--so
that like a rosary the effect is directly related to the number. Thank you!

An excellent and important distinction. Cioran writes well of this
precisely in regard to Beckett. In _The Temptation to Exist_ he inveighs
on the "Contagion of Tragedy": "It is not pity, it is envy the tragic
hero inspires in us, that lucky devil whose sufferings we devour as if
we were entitled to them and he had cheated us of them. . . . Armed with
his fate and rushing toward his defeat faster than he, we spare him at
most a superior smile, while we reserve to ourselves alone the merits of
the fault of the murder, the remorse, or expiation."

And those compromised postures--the murderer, the manque of remorse, the
politician of expiation the . . . poet, abject; abject poetics--are
struck in the mise-en-scene of the often falsely meaningful shorthand of
'institutions'. Like some black-hole that we by definition can't see,
but by necessity *believe* in (what would it mean not to believe, what
would it mean to say "How are you feeling today?") has a mass so great
that even sweetness and light fail to obtain escape velocities.

But we can pre-tend, praetendere. "Estragon (suddenly furious):
Recognize! What is there to recognize? All my lousy life I've crawled
about in the mud! And you talk to me about scenery! (Looking widely
about him) Look at this muckheap! I've never stirred from it! . . . You
and your landscapes! Tell me about the worms!"

David,

Believe me, I'm VERY glad to find out that I've misinterpreted you; I did
note the qualifications you used, even in your original message, but still
thought (and think) that you were making a provocative generalization that
-- as you said -- warranted more comment. My question only inquired if you
were making that generalization based on your own experience, and yes,
that has now been clarified!

I thought "ad hominem" meant an argument -- mud slinging, as it were --
"against the man." Did you think I was doing that? Please: your presence
on this list is an unqualified delight, and, as one correspondent
mentioned to me not long ago, you raise the practice of E-mails to an art
form!

I would still be interesting in hearing, from others, how the practice of
working at an institution -- and, indeed, "institutionalizing" one's
career, which is another issue -- affects the practice of one's art-self.

All best,

Joe

Comments: To: Timmons@ASU.EDU

Dear Jeffery Timmons:

Ok, I'll bite--

but first a couple of questions...

"Objection"?  Why objection?
Are you looking for an answer or making a point?

This is my answer, if one is wanted--

I have been asked this question before by European-Americans ("Whites")-- and it
usually comes up when I talk about my experiences as a woman of color.  For
example, when I describe how it feels to be the only poet of color in a given
magazine or at a poetry reading-- I am sometimes asked "Isn't white a color?"

I started this response by asking a question-- because it has been my experience
that when white people ask me this, it is a way of trying to deny my experiences
of difference-- to dodge the everyday priledges of belonging in the white world
that white people have (without often knowing they have it).  So I would like to
know why you asked.  Is it because you don't understand what is meant or are you
challenging the construction of whiteness and if so how come you are choosing to
go about it?

So, my answer is: white people are people of European heritage (A.G., I recall
wrote he was "white if Jewish people are white").

Also, I have been very curious about the magazine "Race Traitor" -- plan to buy
it when I have more money-- and was wondering if anyone on this list could
please fill me in-- tell me more about their philosophy behind their "rejection
of whiteness" (or correct me if I have that wrong).  Is anyone here involved
with that journal?

Dodie--
just wanted to offer a belated thanks for your post

I know you ended up feeling a little regretful of
this post (why do we worry so much on Poetics?)--
all the more reason to say "thanks". I was beginning
to feel a bit awkward, as my experience of Ginsberg,
despite the importance of his work, is perfectly, if
unintentionally, evoked by the poster you mention.
Which isn't to come down too hard on him--as I
said in my earlier post, this isn't a case of disappointed
rock fan syndrome. ["Joe Strummer once said he cared..."].
It's more that, having grown up in the Reagan era,
the kind of optimism Ginsberg seems, in part, to represent--
it just wasn't available to me, &, to a great extent still isn't.
However I may have appreciated his work, it couldn't
compare as politicized art to, for example, The Minutemen.
["If--if Reagan played disco..."]. That situation could
explain, in part, my attraction to, for instance, Bourdieu
as a post-Marxist, & the conflict model that's implicit
or explicit, variously, in his work. The social field as
site of continuous struggle versus (what I'd like to
believe in) the Revolution that signals the end of history
as we have known it.

Not that I mean to ascribe this position, or this subject-
position to you (I assume you're older than I am--most
of the more vocal listmembers seem to be), nor am I
thanking you for "speaking up for" me--I didn't speak
up more because I felt like maybe I was pissing on
the parade, or the procession, as the case may be. But
I thought I'd, I don't know, say "hi & I liked your post".

best, Chris

ps--You & Kevin did receive those books I sent, right?
They should have arrived some time ago, but the postal
service here doesn't seem to be terribly reliable.

You've got no reason to feel guilty, Dodie.  You wrote that Ginsberg wasn't
a huge liberating force for you regardless of the general tenor of the list
lately & that just seemed honest.  You weren't dissing him, just calling
attention to the fact that alternatives to the mainstream are no more
monolithic than the culture to which they're alternatives.

And, as this list gets ever larger, it's always going to be a good thing to
be reminded that each of us doesn't have the same tastes, hard as that is
to believe at times.

Rachel -- thanks for bringing that up. Before I jump in & lose
list readership let me say you'll be glad to know that Knott has
a new & selected coming out from Boa editions SOON.

    "To American Poets" seems to
be written, in part,  _to_ AG, or at least to his 'generation' of
poets -- which both is & isn't BK's generation.  I don't know when
 it was written, but _The Naomi Poems_  was published in 1968.
The poem you quote from is beautiful, both praising & criticising
American poets from Pound & WCW to the 'vietnam generation'
for being -- well, American poets, at a time when "there's no time
left to write poems" and "The world is not divided into your schools
 of poetry."  We both don't need poetry and need it and need it to
do more.  The lines  -- from which you paraphrase --
seem to me appropriately elegiac:

                       . . .You
are not important.  Your black mountains, solitary farms,
LSD trains.  Don't forget: you are important.
If you fail, there will be no-one left to say so.
If you succeed, there will also be a great silence.  Your names,
         an open
secret in all hearts, no-one will say.  But everywhere
they will be finishing the poems you broke away from.

i objected to the use of "white" in dodies post: it seemed reactive and
not very useful--in fact counter-productive if i might say so.  esp
since i felt that if anyone would never be accused of being complicit
with whatever "white" stands for (bland mediocre meaningless oppressive
tradition whatever) it was ginsburg.  white  was used in a homogenizing fashion
that failed to be attentive to the pluralities that term is used to organize
and did not recognize the virtually indistinct category it is.  of course it
does have a powerful political resonance

if i understand you you are suggesting that some believe the color
"white" to represent a culture?  if that is so i would respond by
suggesting that "white" cannot and should not be so easily equated with
either a distinct culture and that its conflation with
"european-americans" is virtually to use a term that is hopeless riven by
differences and contrasts.  not very useful in the end.

> So I would like to know why you asked.  Is it because you don't understand

challenging.  because in the end if as critics of various political
affliations vaguely represented as "left" we are not able to identify
allies and compatriots or people sympatico and perpetuate the idea that
an important (counter) cultural figure like ginsburg is "white" and
therefore not politically acceptable we lose a valuable ally and more
importantly a historical challenge that paved the way for "other" forms
of difference.  perhaps dodie is right: maybe ag is representative of a
particular formation of white male alienation but rejecting it out of
hand also risks tossing out for mistaken reasons i believe something of
great value.  sorry im not being specific enough about that value: i
leave that for others.  for now.

> So, my answer is: white people are people of European heritage (A.G., I

a rather contingent construction dont you think?  suggests the
ambivalence of that inclusion in that larger category.  if....  and
europe geez how does one make sense of that ethnogeography?  where do you
draw the boundaries there?  there are as much differences as similarities
it seems to me.

ok heres my (tentative) conclusion: race is semantically and
epistemologically more complicated than the linguistic and conceptual
categories used to discuss it.  itd be more useful i think to be aware of
that.  did i make any sense?  did i stumble into a morass?  do i need a
rope--either to pull me out or string me up?  have i gone on too long?  yes.

"All art which excites in us the feeling of joy is so far comic and
according as this feeling of joy is excited by whatever is substantial or
accidental, general or fortuitous, in human fortunes the art is to be
judged more or less excellent: and even tragic art may be said to participate
in the nature of comic art so far as the possession of a work of tragic art
excites in us the feeling of joy.  From this is may be seen that tragedy is
the imperfect manner, and comedy the perfect manner, in art."

Subject:      recommended scholarship

A few months ago, in response to a "what next?" query from Ron Silliman
I outlined at obtuse angle and length about a "Providence School" of
poetry.  Without getting into the semi-mystical maunderings which I'm
sure nobody wants to listen to ever again, I can say that the basic kernel
was to propose a kind of poetry based on a "different" metaphysics from
the popular postmodern blend of what I called nominalism or anti-realism;
the idea is that the poet accepts more or less as a given that there is
a real ordered universe outside our language systems which language,
more or less accurately, is able to represent.  This is realism.

I've discovered a new book which considers James Joyce's work from a
parallel perspective.  Now Joyce, as you know, is an avatar of postmodernist
critics & theorists.  There is a strong stream of postmodern/avant-garde/
deconstructive/feminist criticism which claims Joyce as model & percursor.
So I want to recommend the following book.  It's not the product of an
aging bitter departmental new critic fluffhead, either (and it's not by
Blasing, folks!!).

_The Word According to James Joyce_, by Cordell Yee, Bucknell UP, 1997

Though I'm only partway through, part of his argument is that, contra
many many critics, Joyce never forsook his roots in Aristotelian realism,
modified by his own discoveries in 20th cent. "process metaphysics"
with respect to the ability of language to represent what is
real. & in hopes of forestalling purely political pre-judgements,
I quote the following:

"As far as the political implications of Joyce's works are concerned, I
have no quarrel with anti-authoritarianism or feminism.  I do question
whether those political impulses are necessarily tied to a rejection of
the linguistic practices that make representation possible."

This sentence doesn't offer much in isolation, but it points to an issue
fairly relevant to the divide, say, between theoretical-left writing
theorists & other leftish writers (the whole langpo/Apex of the M debate).

I want to emphasize that Yee doesn't seem to have a tendentious axe to
grind, but he takes issue with a lot of Joyce scholarship because he's
actually interested in authorial intention & is trying to discover what
JOYCE was up to (& not so much what his playful interpreters want to bend
him into).  It's a new jumping-off place.   - Henry Gould

Note that what I found weird was arguments about what a third party who is

becomes silly not to ask. I did not mean to imply that the discussion of
words or ideas was weird, and I certainly don't think that a query need be
answered (although it could make for quite a discussion). Nor was I
responding to just this post. I am mum on the subject hereafter and will not

I like the non-heroic good sense of this, yet find myself disagreeing.
Maybe I don't quite get what you're saying.  To write well - seems like
hard work, not compromise & forgetting.  Or perhaps you mean the writer
compromises everything BUT writing? & the feeling of futility - is this
an effect of culture-glut? Or this compromise is wisdom, not betrayal.

poetry that i just read. students wrote their exams earlier this morning:

        (it's 8:30 am. 8:30 am. 8:30 am. 8:30 am. 8:30 am)

But "secuction" is good. Surely a word that Ginsberg would like. A secret,
seductive concoction of return-of-the-repressed, hiccuping, cocksucking by
the Secaucus 7, suction masters & section doctors, etcetera. Just what
Flaubert in Henry's quote is talking about, and certainly art is a process,
but when I wrote "Discontents" I was suggestion an origin for that process.
For as someone said, writing is hard work, although the joy ("secuction!")
can be great. Something
h a s  to come out. Were you there when it all came out? Ginsberg came out
early. Something out of sight deep inside is going to come out any . . .
time . . .NOW! It doesnt erupt from the author, does it? It appears to
erupt from the sentence, to the erupting reader. It hadn't been part of our
content, it had been dis-content, denied & hidden content or mine or yours,
& now, it's all over the papers, all over the newssheets. Barely civilized,
it was, until we saw how expected it had, all along, (honky commas) been.
Honky commas sit on it so as it wont blow, blow away. Until we began to
tame it, to domesticate it, find ways to compromise with it, married to it
must live with it, must alter it misunderstand it deny it ignore it. Must
ask if its author got out of bed on the wrong side the morning of the night
he made this *object* this non-ad-hominumizable object, this un homicidal
ding-an-sich, this ding in his fender, "it just [not simply] happened to me
as it were or was." As I-were-or-was was watching.

"Will have to [insert verb here] later" is also good, thanks Katherine
Lynes. Lets say the verb, whichever, is the process Henry mentions. We dont
know what it is yet but we know to leave a place for it, and we know to
cover up that place (read as a sentence without brackets, the reader finds
nothing open.)

Robin Blaser : "poets are the deodorant pucks in the urinal of life." In

pissoir that is. But with its nose towards the stars, blossoms in an

Now they know you know it of yourself, they'll know they know it of
themselves. Then deny it. Go back and do it over. I love you, all of you.

Well, to tell the truth, some of you may be old enough to remember the "We
Were There" series of history books.  "We were There at the Alamo" .
"We were there at Valley Forge". etc.  Back in 1962 or thereabouts I
read one called "We Were There When They Invented the Frisbee".
Everything else just seemed to click. And no, David Bromige, secuction
is not one of the 4 Major Squeezes which set the cosmos in motion.
This is my authoritative comment on that subject. (I'm sure Jack & Eric
will want to get in on that one, though.)

At the Russ-Amer Hoboken conference Elena Shvarts mentioned her interest
in scandal as the force of change in society.  Her example was not
repressed/exposed desire but the virgin birth of Christ [whatever you
make of that].  I point this out as an example of a different
way of poetic thinking from that which reigns in the West [i.e. sexuality
as the master-key to the Meaning of Life & the Blakean One-Eyed Vision
of our discontented so-called artists].

Henry Gould asked me how a writer is involved in compromise and
forgetting.

To write a poem is dependent on a whole series of experiences prior to
the writing. Most of the ones relevant to writing focus on poetry,
poetry traditions, and the interface between poetry and other aspects
of life -- politics, living situation, nature, weather, advertising,
etc, the list varies depending ont the individual.

Before writing, the poet has already committed to certain positions
within all these forces, a position necessarily wrought with compromise
since the forces impinging are myriad.

But to write, the poet cannot focus on these forces and the necessary
compromise.  The poet must put one word after another.  While sometimes
hard work (though I think of writing as more often joyful) this is the
forgetting:  Not focusing on the foundation, the foundation necessarily
composed of compromise, that makes writing possible.

This is all to say that I don't believe in individual vision, and that
writing is irreducibly social.

Best to all,

jeff

I love that quote, David, but borrowing the feminist perspective, maybe
that's what certain of our listers mean when they say they're tired of
being pissed on by male poets!

p.s. could you under-the-table me your snail-mail address? thanks, sp

Hoverer is too hard to say, too many syllables. I agree, lurk has sinister
connotations, unwarranted here. Look/looker would seem to have fewer,
though maybe some old-timey slang ones:"She's a real looker!" I'll keep
thinking. It's a good quest. sp

Dear Michael, it's Kevin Killian, thanks for letting us know about Joe
Dunn's death.  He was, I think, a wonderful writer, and one of the nicest
people I've ever met.  His friends and admirers were all, I suppose,
waiting for the other shoe to fall, but this is still awfully sad.  I hope
more of his work sees its way into print.

I'm not involved with the mag, but you should be able to get it, or at
least the collection of writings drawn from it published under the same
name, at a library.

The main thrust of their philosophy is that race is not a biological fact,
but a social construct, largely developed in the US in place of the (more
common in Europe at least) nationalistic views used to exclude folks from
social & political communities.

"White", "Black", and "Asian" are vague terms that deny the complex
dynamics of ethnic, national, personal, cultural, etc. influences that come
into play in an individual's life.  There aren't monolithic cultures that
are White, Black, or Asian, but many cultural affects that get lost when
these more generic terms become the center of discussion.

Hank,

I'm pretty sure there isn't a book-length bio published yet.  There are
some useful (though, depending on how detailed you need this, probably very
spotty) articles/interviews in various magazines like downbeat, and check
collections of occasional pieces by Whitney Bailliet, Martin Williams, etc.

If there's no individual vision, then the social is a one-eyed beast.
I too subscribe to the belief that humanity is one Being, that you are
me and I am you and we are all Jack Spandrift, as Eric Blarnes once put
it (in his personal memoir, _Living?  Isn't that Something...?_
Univ. of Left Overbie Press, 1994), and that this one reality is the
key to social justice as well as joy.  NEVERTHELESS there's a big
difference between the stoplight at 1st and Hennepin and the stoplight
that used to be at Cedar & Riverside, and it's that DIFFUDIFFURANCE
that the artist as INDUVINDUHYOU-ALL is trying SO HARD to get at
in her depiction of STERN & DAFT REALITY.   - Henry Gould

Writing situated as critique (SOMETIMES) versus writing writing
which refuses/represses its site (site as in scope-barrel-trigger) or
claims 'outsider' status--noncomplicity ["this is Art" or "it's just
art, man"] or ["I wasn't doing anything, honest"], i.e., nothing to be
complicit with.

Q: Situation as--what? Production or reception?  "I mean to say this"
or "this means this". Or both & how do they differ, exactly?

Or, possibly, to fetch together two current threads (so alter both):

|   To the dead, beyond imitation of life,
|             we must report something
|   different from poets before us,
|             raining tropes on their

|             of idle words. *Tremors
|   bring tears, longing ends in grief.*

Unless that's just an excuse to repeat these lines--which
repetition needs no excuse. Thanks to David Israel for

Yeap, I believe Herb is right. There is however one full-length book (in
French) on Monk I know of: _Thelonious Monk_ by the French poet Yves

I'm mostly in agreement with what Jeff says here. If I didn't forget the
inevitable compromises I have to make (many of which I'm barely aware of
(and at what level willfully, I'm not sure)), then I'd never write
anything. I'd fill pages with my imbedded parentheses. No, I wouldn't even
get that far. Yes, writing necessarily comes from a social construct in my
view. I cringe at the suffering genius model. BUT, isn't the act of
forgetting perhaps an act of individuation? Perhaps the place where we
"show" (surely not in full consciousness) how we have wove and been woven
by the social web. Of course, this activity may just be a lie we tell
ourselves to get through the night. As Donne said: "Oh what a web we weave
when first practice to deceive."

Herb et al,

I haven't been reading the list this past week because I had a grant due,
but KK dutifully saved and showed me every post that made any kind of
response to what I posted.  I think he should start a cottage business
doing this for people on the list.  It's a great service.  KK's Filterarma.

I wish you'd send a copy of your post to SPT's funders, where in many cases
I have to count everybody in the above groups you mention, as well as
"Hispanic" (which I was told during an arts adminstration seminar not to
use because it is a bad word invented during the Regan administration) and
the mysterious category "Other."  Then I am required to give hard numbers
and percentages of total for board, staff, constituency served.  These are
called Diversity Statistics.  No questions about income levels and class
these days--I think for two reasons, the first being the obvious one that
Marxism is over and class is no longer sexy.  But, then, more
problematically, I think a lot of condescension is implicit is this
model--all whites are priviledged and all Blacks, Asians, Hispanics and
Others are downtrodden innocents who need to be raised up by the Great
White Funders--there's a kind of noble savage tone to the whole project.  I
think is is apparent in a lot of what gets funded--sophisticated and
formally challenging writing is not going to seduce anybody into throwing
bucks at it.

It seems there is a desire to turn writing back to a folk art--like it's
very difficult to get money to support "professional" writers--rather money
is given to projects which help people who wouldn't normally write express
their feelings about their downtrodden state--and everybody feels good.  Of
course, it's possible that some members of this downtrodden category will
then move to the professional category, but that's not the goal of these
projects.  I'm not saying that these projects are unworthy of funding, I'm
just saying that there doesn't seem to be much left over for projects that
would promote the development of professional writers, and so the only way
to get training is that area more and more seems to be by entering the
elite of graduate writing programs (and to come out the other end with no
marketable skills and owing tens of thousands of dollars).  I am someone
who benefited greatly from free public writing programs.  And I know the
word professional is problematic, but I'm trying to grunt towards some
kinds of distinctions here--and I know any time anybody does such a thing
they're opening themselves to attack (attack, in a polite middle class way,
of course--I wouldn't expect anything rude here).

SPT is asked to hand out evaluation questionaires at our events where the
audience is supposed to check off what group they belong to.  Audience
members were continually indicating on the questionnaires that they found
these categories problematic and reductive, so, following the example of
another group, we changed our questionnaire to read something like, "We're
often asked to provide these statistics by our funders, so please . . ."

To clarify:  I *am* in favor of providing a broad racial mix in the people
I program--and I've been taking steps to broaden that mix futher.  This is
something I think is good (and which has resulted in some great events),
not something I do grudgingly.

Of course these categories are reductive--but my point is that to say these
categories aren't real is to not live in the real world--and further, since
they are so vastly operative in the world, I think that it would be
difficult not to have internalized them and see the world through them--no
matter how much you disapprove of them.

the new party isn't necessarily starting the revolution.  they are more
like continuing the *new* left, which is not as radically about ending
globalized capitalism.  they have great ideas, but don't seem to focus on
poverty and its increase as a result of global cap as a central issue.  if
ending globalized capitalism is your thing, then philly's labor party might
be more up your alley.  i think the new party is more about trying to involve
the *people* of labor and green interests in democracy and maybe socializing
a few things. . . .   this of course is just my reading . . . .

This seems a rather overly simplistic binarism, Jeff.

"If the 'poem' of _otherness_ is already begun _infrapsychisme_, our
art must equal this 'reseau de telecommunication'; for, as de
Beauregard says, 'in it exist "les futurs contingents en acte" but we are
unconscious of them.'

. . .

"The poet  does not dwell upon the absence of harmony in historical
isolation, as does the contemporary philosopher; he can speak before
he knows, and this act connects him to the 'spirit of man' which Olson
says 'is always ahead of his ideas.' A transitional period of
disharmony, regarded not situatively but morphogenetically, may even
contain a new _given_: 'Communal insanity ceases to be insanity'. Paz
writes:
        Destruction was my Beatrice, Mallarme says in a letter to a
        friend; at the end of the journey the poet does not
        contemplate the Idea, symbol or archetype of the universe, but
        a space in which a constellation appears: his poem.

"This place of emergence is in keeping with the Minoan gesture of
epiphany, which distinguishes it from modern 'primitive' practices that
attempt to induce epiphany by a non-ordering intervention instead of a
non-central position."

He got that from Freud, didn't he?  Sounds like a quote from Freud's late
essay, "Surfer Coyotes and Their Discontents".  There's always somebody
who understands our true animal bearing.  Thoth was an owl.  Pith was a

by some explainer or other with wolf hair.  (FERAL BIPED - CAUTION)

WARNING: LONG POST ON POLITIX,
IN RESPONSE TO KENT'S QUERY



Kent--

I've been active off and on with the New Party.  I might be more active if
they were a presence in Georgia, as they are *extremely* oriented toward
building right now at the local level.  A few people (in Wisconsin?? in
the midwest) founded it about 7 (?) years ago; the guiding light is
generally considered to be Joel Rodgers, a poli sci academic by trade, who
has authored or co-authored many of their public statements.  There was a
quite impressive essay in the Nation, which to some extent constituted a
founding gesture as far as much of the country was concerned, and got
hundreds of people (including myself) hooked up with the party.

Their platform is in flux and very vague, which has pissed off lots of
people on the left, and led to many attacks.  The NP says that this is
because ultimately they want the folks who are building the party to draw
up its detailed credo, and it is still in very formative stages.  They
claim I think a couple of thousand members, some of whom are of course
paper.  They have very active chapters in some major cities like Chicago.
Their early, tentative outlines of belief/strategy emphasize elections and
include what I would call a classic social-democratic set of details.
One of their defining features is belief in a tactic called fusion..This
would involve placing a candidate (usually a Democrat) on the ballot (for
anything from school board to President) under the New Party as well as
her own party...The theory is that as the NP swings people to the left, it
could demonstarate that it had been indispensible to gettng and keeping
that cadidate in office...Said cadidate would then (tho' a Demo and
usually quite unwilling) be forced to move invreasingly to the left, to
retain NP support and not lose the next election.  Fusion was outlawed in
most states to help crush the Socialists, Populists and other left
electoralist force early in this century.  They are hoping to overturn
those laws.

My modified admiration for them is based on the fact that (at least at
first) they were articulating a pretty forthright left/social-democrat
attack on the Republicrat structure, which I hoped would pry activists and
working class people away from the Democratic obscenity.  It remains to be
seen, in my estimation, whether they can deliver on that promise.  Where
they are active with ten or more members they have won city council and
similar type elections (sometimes in loose coalition with left-leaning
local Demo's) with impressive results.  They seem in my experience to be
doing better than most leftists of the past two decades at drawing in
**real** working class people of all races.  (The main argument in favor
of fusion, in my opionion, and maybe in favor of the NP, is that most
workers who haven't sunk deep into despair, who are somewhat harder to
mobilize, still believe the media that the Republicrats are and **can only
be** the one and only game in town..Fusion offers a way to draw in folks
like that, while they still half-believe that only a vote for a Demo. is
not "thrown away."  Many friends of mine, including those who think the
immediate way forward is mainly electoral (a debateable point certainly),
now suspect that the NP is going to repeat the trajectory of Democratic
Socialists of America, and become a sunday tea-club entirely subservient
for all practical purposes to the Democratic wing of the Republicrats, and
thus dead as a political force.  I'm not convinced of that, yet.  I
totally agree with you that there should be an IMMEDIATE merger of all
reasonably left parties that think the way forward is (partly) electoral:
most green formations, the New Party, the Labor Party, Campaign for a New
Tomorrow, and others...(A considerable number are involved with the
Independent Progressive Political Action Network, a half-step toward
unity, which I've been involved with recently; but many are only
half-committed..)

Much more could be said, but that's the general outlines of one (highly
personal) response to them...They have a good website.  As for the Labor
Party, which you mention, until their naitonal leadership wholly endorses
activism/membership by folks outside certified union locals, and commits
to running its own cadidates, it remains a pretty limited option for most
of us...And again, many (including some of its own members) believe with
considerable reason that as long as it says it is a "party" but won't
field its own cadidates, it is going to be simply a wing of the Clintonian
ultra-right Demos, as is so much of the labor movement which is
responsible for founding it.  At the moment, from what I can see, that's a
more compelling accusation than the similar one against the NP..

For years I thought it would be a good thing to write a "folk" tale. Did
that (too long to quote). Then a fortune cookie :"If you have broken this
cookie with your fingers/ don't lick them." (actually had cookies made with
that in them for a party). Recently I thought i'd invent a bathroom
graffito, see if it had legs--start it in a few places and watch the spread:
"Better to light a match than to curse the methane." Any volunteers for the
experiment, my blessings upon you.

Jeffery,

As I remember it, I said "white guys" in my original post.  It's
interesting that you latched onto "white."  Why not deconstruct "guys," why
not lauch into gender performance here?

There's a young scholar at NYU, whose name I can't remember, who is currently
writing a biography of Monk.  He was featured on PBS recently in a program
about the lives of minority faculty across the country. Try the American

It seems like this kind of intellectualized and evasive answer neglects to
address the positions of race as they actually function.  In addition to
the semantic, epistemological, linguistic, and conceptual categories
mentioned, there happen to be physical, emotional, and social realities
which are met through daily experiences rather than through
cerebral--distant--contemplation.  Whiteness is a construct, but it's also
a reality I live with.  Which ever way you think about it, skin says a lot.
A body reveals certain traits--Asian, African, European--but it doesn't
always give you details of national heritage or even ethnicity, as in a
country like Burundi.  A white person's categorical discussion of race
pretty much reveals the problems Hoa pointed out in her post.  Whites own
the show, producing their whiteness through their own terms rather than
listening and responding to whiteness as others experience it.

Finally, it is more than a bit ironic for a white person to determine a
"useful" vocabulary for racial discussion.  It seems like the appropriate
response to questions of race would be not to retreat into vague conceptual
terms, but to engage them in a more heart-felt way.  As it is, the above
seems dismissive and casual, and it removes personal experience from the
complicated issues surrounding race.

 When he first showed up at Word of Mouth I landed on him to tell him how

actually embarassed him I think - He was struck that we even  knew what he

He without question agreed to be the ghost of Lorca for my AFTER LORCA

he was just simply a fine man a fine poet & any one interested in Boston, SF

 would have a grand time looking into his work

gazer seems a bit too psychoanalytic . . . what about something more
pastoral, like "grazer," as in "I'm a grazer in the open fields of

well in my opinion you are both absolutely right and it's an extremely
generative question to be sure:

it's really not an either/or:

for example one might say:

I don't believe in glorifying individual vision

or

I don't believe that individual vision can best be looked at as a stable
quality but rather as a flux constructed by power and specific cultural
and historical entanglements

or

I don't believe in forgetting that individual vision is also part of
political textuality

well, there is also "auditing" --
or for that matter, "reading" --
one could be a "consumer" or an "imbiber" or a "tippler" or a "totler"
[sp?, as in tea-totling] --

a listserv totler (taking in the totality of discourse)

which makes one wonder abt. origins of "tea-totler" (if specifically contra
tippler or other such alcoholicals) --

a watcher of posts, a seer of sentences . . . . ?

(i'm still not satisfied in this name-quest)

d.i.

p.s.:  grazer does, of course, have specific yuppie-dieting connotations --

have some things in its favor -- a chewer of listserv cud)

I agree that the term is impenetrable and tricky-- Melville's whale-- and at the

that "white" is a "concept" designed to divide and imbue power-- to other
others-- I am at the receiving end of this in many palpable ways, whether it is
people (potential landlords, employers etc.) not getting calling me back
because of my "foreign" name or people acting shocked at my perfect English and
then "Welcoming" me to America or people saying "You know I know a Vietnamese
man.  He is *very* intelligent" or people asking me if my parents know kung-fu.

Each time I said "people" in the previous, I meant white people.  It is not a

experience I have with "white" Americans.

Interestingly, "stalker" -- in the great metaphysical sci-fi film by Andre
Tarkovsky (based, I think, on novel by Stanislav Lem (presumably titled,
like the film, *Stalker*?)-- as was likewise the other great Tarkovsky
sci-fi film *Solaris*) -- "stalker", I say, in said film, denoted the fellow
who was a guide to the regions of mystery (ergo, something of a guru
character, while also an outlaw of a benign sort) -- of course, I don't know
what Russian (from Tarkovsky) or Polish (from Lem?) word this English
"stalker" translates -- but the English word, there, seemed more along the
lines of "stalking the wild mushrooms" -- one who is knowledgeable of
the esoterica of a natural environment of some type (the particular
natural environment, in this case, being of "The Zone" -- the region of
land that it was officially forbidden to visit . . . .)

not sure this is support for the nominative candidacy (candidative
nomination??) of "stalker" in lieu of "lurker" -- just vital info & idle
chit-chat (can you tell the diff ?)

     The problem might be LURK was best in the first

     captures the sudden reveal - "Ive been here

Sounds like a position to occupy in American football. Isnt it "tangled
web," and wasnt it Robbie Burns? or Shakespeare? Was it really Donne, or
were you, Steven Marks, embodying your point about forgetting and the
individual (a provocative one, btw)? "Remember to spell" was a gesture in
my piece, towards what i think Jeff may have meant, and you may have, by
"compromise." I recall a student (and he wasnt entirely alone in his notion
of the individual) who insisted a word could mean, in his poetry, precisely
what he wanted it to mean, w/o reference to any dictionary or any common
parlance. Some of his classmates told him he was "just jacking off"--as
though there were something bad about jacking off. But lets take that (not
masturbation, but deliberately uncommunicative behavior) as one pole of
poetry, and then, say, Eddie Guest as the other pole. Consider the
distribution along this axis in terms of accessiblity, and one sense of
compromise will be clear

Of course, Henry, repressed material -- dis-contented material -- will show
variation from individual to individual.  Some of us have our sexuality all
worked thru or out, we dont feel uneasy or irritable when its discussed,
and can feel or affect indifference about it. I'm that way myself, I merely
use sexual reference because I've noticed others often enjoy it. But
patriotism is missing from my palette altogether, and will probably erupt
from my shadow in the most primitive way one of these poems. Other examples
I could have used: that our civilization survives thru murder &
enslavement, but that it manages to keep that out of sight most of the
time, or at least, unnamed and disembodied; or that if Beale Street could
talk, if Beale Street could talk, married men would have to take their beds
& walk. But I guess that's the ugly head of sex being reared again. Darn
this Occident! I should go live in Thailand, where they have other stuff
under their minds. Safdie-Bromige makes me feel like a catch or a belt, but
hey, I can live with it. db

Organization: Highland Community College
Subject:      L+A+N+G+P+O and New Party

Mark and Kristin:

Thanks for the replies on the New Party. For what it's worth Kristin,
I was being facetious about the revolution starting without me. I do
think that's going to be a while, and I'm sure that the New Party
(if global capitalism is brought to an end by something other
than a giant asteroid) won't be its red wedge. Why do you see the new
Labor Party as "more promising" of overthrowing "global capitalism"?
Do you mean its present leadership and current program offer this
hope, or do you mean that a political party in this country firmly
grounded in working class organizations is an absolute prerequisite
for smashing the rule of capital? (geez, now do you all see what I
mean about the asteroid? What's coming first?)

But Mark: one of the things I find interesting about the NP is that it
has apparently gathered old CPers like Zinn, DSA types like
Hightower, radical Christians like West, and real independents like
Chomsky together under a common banner. Of course, these are just big
names, but in the protracted context of the U.S. left's sectarian
provincialism, the symbolism of such a gathering doesn't
seem insignificant? Is Zinn's presence indicative of a broader CP
presence in the NP? Have they all "fused" into it? (Why wouldn't they?
The CPUSA's been a loyal social-democratic party ever since Hitler
stabbeb Stalin in the back.)

And glad to hear from someone who has hung in there through these
very "unsocialist" times (and it *will* eventually surely be au
courant again to be anti-capitalist!) that the question of unity
amongst new and viable left organizations seems to be in the
discussion. But don't you think that if such unity comes to be, Mark,
that this conspiratorial "fusion" crap should go out the window? Easy
for me to say after ten or so years of drawing a Trotskyist pension I
guess,(though I can at least say I was an active member in '85 of the
San Jose state farm militia in northern Managua, Nicaragua, even if I
did wet my pants the one time we came under [heavy] fire).

But if there is a "Republicrat" political structure, and if the two
parties are primarily there to give vent to the incestual squabbles
of this country's ruling class, why participate in the "obscenity",
as you put it, of what's going on? Why try to "pull" local Democrats
to the "left" via some kind of elaborate electoral blackmail when one
can present an honest and unwatered program to the public, stating
clearly that there is no hope ever of any kind of
true change as long as we keep voting for the parties of imperialism?
(is that term still in use?) Why not say clearly that those who are
the most reprehensible of all are those "progressive" sophisticates
who know the score, but still are seduced to vote for Carter,
Mondale, Dukakis, Clinton, and seduce otheres to do so, just so we
can have a little lesser evil? (ok, so we got the lesser evil with
Clinton--how's it such a breakthrough over Bush? Explain to me what
is so different.)

I underestimated my numbers in my last post when I said that Nader got
half a million votes--he got about 700,000 in 26 states and he barely
campaigned. The point would be that this intimates the potential of
principled, radical gestures on the local and national arenas, if
only intelligent progressives woudl stop doing 69 with the Democrats.
If there's going to be a Deb's-like resurgence of independent,
radical politics in this country it's going to require a simple
but firm step outside the hall of mirrors we're given, don't you
think?

But what does this have to do with poetry, especially since I titled
this post as I did? (I can picture Maria Damon with one of her
inevitable two-liners, asking). well, simply this: I've been on this
list for about five months now, and I have been startled that there
is apparently such little interest in discussing issues related to
how poets might integrate themselves into issues of broader political
commitment. This seems strange to me since the background to the very
existence of this list is a community of poets in 70's and 80's trying
to figure out how the act of writing might lead and be led into a
broader understanding of political engagement. If the Language
movement is evolving into other things, it seems to me (and please
correct me if I'm off) to be evolving into a diffuse kind of
aestheticism that can go on for weeks slamming Ed Dorn as a
fascist, talk intricately about the institutional implications of
Bernstein's and Perelman's poetics, but say virtually nothing at all
when an honorable publisher of avant-garde writing (the FC2 affair,
which happens, luckily, to have come to temporary close) is under
government attack and makes an appeal for solidarity.

What am I saying Mark Presjnar? I'm rambling, but I think I'm onto
something, even if few will respond, because, after all, it's just me.

For anyone interested...

Last week, I went to hear Helene Cixous give a paper.  The title was
something like (apparently she had several versions and permutations
of this title on the poster, which I never saw):  "My Menagerie &
Philosophy:  Stigmata."
        It's funny, but at first I wasn't sure what she was doing.  She
seemed to be relating a reminiscence about her childhood pet dog and
how it bit her, yet this was not a short story, it had been billed as an
academic talk.  Now, I'm not one to quibble over genre distinctions,
still, I didn't think she would be relating the circumstances surrounding
her dog's death for merely fictional purposes.  But gradually as she
talked I realized how immense a thing she was doing, how complex,
and how extraordinary to posit the dog's body as text for what was
going on around her and her family, growing up in Algeria.
        To begin at the beginning:  She started by mentioning such
writers as St. Augustine, Proust, Joyce, and Genet, all as introductions
for a literary history of stigmata.  She talked about stigmata as being
(or her previously thinking of stigmata as being) very catholic, very
masculine.  And, as it is something that happens to the body without
the body's control, one could consider circumcision a form of
stigmata.  In the same way, violent inscription on the body leaves
psychosomatic symptoms and scars.  This intro lead into her talk on
her dog Fibbs (Phipps?), and how his rage and teeth marked her left
foot, his bite became a pain imbedded on her brain.
        Basically, her family (Jewish, French-speaking) lived within
what was then known as Arab Algeria.  They were tolerated because
her father was a doctor and helped the surrounding neighbours.  But
once he died, their neighbours began turning against them, for being
Jewish and for being "French."  The anger and hatred took the form of
everyday verbal and physical (rocks thrown at them, etc.) abuse.  The
dog, too, was abused and did not understand why.  Eventually, it
began to attack its attackers, and the family had to chain it up within
the yard.  "We chained up our own incarnation," she said, "we beat the
innocent."  She thought the dog didn't understand because she didn't
understand.  The dog became a chained up cross waiting for her in the
yard.  Fibbs represented a love that was twisted, bloody, criminal.
And proved that to live is to survive in chains.  "We're all in the
process of becoming mean dogs," Cixous said, "one bites one's
brother, one bites oneself."  She felt, eventually, that she was not his
sister (though she had longed for a baby brother when their father
brought the dog home), but his assassin.
        When the dog bit her, his bite was penetrating; a hideous
attachment.  She realized he was her own raving twin.  And at that
moment, there was a slight beating on the inside of her brain, a
minuscule wound that would not close.  An ornament.  Poison, she
realized, is not hate, but weak love.  Somehow, she failed the dog,
abandoned it in terror and pity.  She did not rush into the flames to
save her dog/child.
        The dog was Job: it had ticks that it suffered from horribly,
soft vampires that suckled the dog to death.  Neither she nor the dog
knew where to go to prevent death from arriving.  And, as she would
not give her life for him, she could not be there in his death (after
biting her, he ran out into the street).  Fibbs died because he was
outraged at the injustice that surrounded him, yet helpless to do
anything but rage.  And a wound, at least, brings a sense of immediacy
into an intolerable situation.
        She concluded with the words, "I did not love him there in the
garden of war.  Not yet, but later."
        I think it's really fascinating the way, by merely describing her
childhood relationship with a problematic pet, Cixous managed not
only to discuss a volatile political situation, but also to posit a
narrative and analysis of stigmata and how we expect the body to
recall violent and emotional events.  Just thought I'd post this for those
interested but unable to attend.  Cheers,
        Nicole Markotic

Subject:      Sandhyabasha, from a while back

This is Anselm Hollo.  Colleagues Anne Waldman and Andrew Schelling (who
promise to acquire e-mail capability *soon*) have asked me to forward the
following in re the Sanskrit Poetics thread:

(Anne:) Yes, the somewhat free use of the term "sandhyabasha" doesn't come
particularly from a reading of Eliade and was never used or recorded to my
knowledge by Kerouac or Ginsberg or other confreres.  I had Andrew
Schelling's expanded sense of the term and my own desire to present the idea
of a secret code--perhaps intuited by other initiates (see the collaboration
"Pull My Daisy".  We are certainly aware of the literal definitions.
 Apologies for taking poetic liberties.  This only encourages me to more
dialogue with the scholars.  "Ulatbamsi," more literally upsidedown is
probably more accurate term.  And of course there's "dakini script" which is
what some poets think they're onto, not to mention the sense of poem as
"terma," or hidden treasure.  What do you think?  Not on the Net yet; this
intervention is courtesy of Anselm Hollo who alerted me to the discussion.

(Andrew:)  Confess I'm the source for Waldman's use of the Sanskrit term
sandhyabasha.  It is quite unlikely Kerouac ever encountered the term,
certainly he never used it.  Anne ws employing it as a way to line up Kerouac
"goofiness" (playful duplicity in language) with older Tantric traditions.
 Her "upside down" skips across to another word, another tradition,
ulatbamshi--which I know best from Charlotte Vaudeville's scholarly work on
Kabir--who of course did not write in Sanskrit.  I've tended to use the term
sandhyabasha without much concern for getting right its original Sanskrit
usage.  This I hope is okay since nobody knows precisely what it meant in the
old days.  Hence debate about whether it is sandhya- (twilight) or sandha-
(intentional) speech.  I've tried to give it a  contemporary spin: poetry as
a place where language has the "conjoint" (lit. sandhya-) lights of day and
night, waking & dreaming--goofiness or double-meaning--as opposed to secret
initiate language.  I gave my essay book published in Indi the title Twilight
Speech.  Its USA publication I'd hoped would have the same title, but Leslie
Scalapino who published it was alerted by Philip Whalen to how close the term
sounds to "twilight sleep" which he said is what women go into when they have
spinals for Caesarean sections.  So Leslie insisted we come up with another
title.  As for the Masson/Merwin book, it is a good collaboration.  Masson's
introduction particularly fine.  The choice of poems is surprising--even
inspired--though Merwin doesn't know the language so he can swim a bit with
tone and meaning.  Masson was once upon a time a terrific Sanskritist, but on
occasions sloppy.  Notice for instance the opening verse to his introduction,
which is not in any Sanskrit anyone I know has been able to decode.  Not even
Masson when I took it to him and said what the hell's this.  Said he thinks
he got it from his guru.

End of Waldman/Schelling transmission

Nicole --

thanks for the detailed & interesting notes --

I'd only, some time ago, glanced at one of Cixous' books; this does
make me want to return to it (or look at others) . . .

She seems to remind me a bit (or in a general way) of that other
interesting academic experimentalist (so to say), Ann Carson . . .

best,

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through
values or sentiments, in _one_ time, in _one_ history, in
_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality
and encouraging him to offer it as an example or impose
it as a conquering assertion. -- Maurice Blanchot

STALKER -- as brilliant a movie I know of -- based on the novel ROADSIDE
PICNIC by the "Strugatsky Brothers" (Arkady and Boris Strugatsky),
Russians. In his MICROWORLDS Lem has an essay on ROADSIDE PICNIC (I
believe there are other associations between Lem and the Strugatskys as
well). Was released in US translation in late 70s/early 80s along with
several other of their books. Very interesting -- but Tarkovsky makes its
content quite a bit more "metaphysical" than is the book, which on my
reading suffered a bit from that excessive sense of ironic humor from
which some of Lem's work also suffers. ROADSIDE PICNIC, if I remember
aright, actually says what's in the Zone -- it was more fun not to know
(exactly).

Essays on Contemporary Poetry and Poetics
John Taggart
With an introduction by Marjorie Perloff
A collection of 19 related essays on contemporary American poetry and
poetics, published as journal articles between 1975 and 1989, by poet
and theorist John Taggart.  By focusing on the work of several major
and less well-known American experimental poets from the 1930s to the
present, Taggart not only traces the origins and evolution of this
experimental tendency in recent poetry, but also develops new
theoretical tools for reading and appreciating these innovative and
complex works.  "Taggart's insights . . . are invaluable, for he
blends appreciation with analysis, information with inspiration, and
logic with imagination."--Philosophy and Literature 272 pages, ISBN

The many associations raised by Anne and Andrew--much gratitude for the
time they took--include one I think is particularly interesting: Philip
Whalen's tipoff about "twilight speech/twilight sleep," which brings up
whole new associations--the liminal states of consciousness: just waking,
just sleeping, neither waking nor sleeping. On the list of exercises
Bernadette Mayer culled from work at St. Mark's is a direction to write
something every day as you are just waking or just falling asleep.

I didn't expect to be playing devil's advocate here (or even

American pragmatism which he says at its best "consists of a future

enable more effective action.  Its basic impulse is a plebeian
radicalism that fuels an antipatrician rebeliousness for the moral aim

Kent's stipulation.  If one buys West's description of the"aim,"  is
bashing "progressive sophisticates" who voted for Clinton really a
useful way to direct your words and attention?  Clinton over Dole or
Bush may not have made a big difference to many people on this
list but the cuts those Republicans would have made or allowed in
education and a host of other social programs would have deeply
affected many Americans.  Likewise on race: its widely believed that
Clinton's Affirmative Action speech written by he and Stephanopolos

want to stress that I am *by no means* a huge Clinton fan - I
disagree with him at least on a weekly basis about something.  But I
find our contrarian attitude toward maninstream politics facile.
Ironically we end up saying roughly the same things about, say,
Clinton, or Democrats generally, that the right is saying about them:
namely, that they suck.  I don't see how this can be productive: save
the venom for the people who are really, consciously, deviously and
cynically, trying to fuck up this country.  If Dole hadn't been such a
schmuck Nader's votes in California could have landed us with a
Republican president who would have done a shitload of damage.  I
didn't vote for Nader because I suspect his penchant for self-
promotion and because, yeah, I thought it'd be pissing in the wind.
Does that make me an inconsequential "sophisticate" and "the most
reprehensible"?  I hope we all have bigger fish to fry.

Let me add a couple and make a brief comment.
Greater evil means two more Clarence Thomases on the court.
Greater evil means southeast Utah becomes the world's largest open-pit mine.
Greater evil means starwars.

Clinton is hard to swallow, but it's better than shooting yourself in the foot.

If a third, or fourth or fifth, party wants to be effective nationally, it
better start as "a grass roots project that might put
up local candidates." That's called an infrastructure. Not only would it be
hard to win a wider election without such an organization, but if by some
fluke a Perot, say, were to get elected he would be essentially powerless,
having no elected allies whatsoever.

Obviously, like Kent, I think, I'm not one of those who think that violent
overthrow, with all the fun that would be for the uncomprehending millions
who could stand to lose a little weight anyway, is particularly likely as an
avenue for change.

Nothing there I disagree with, David - in fact I think Rene Girard's
anthropological theories about civilization being IN ESSENCE repressed
mob violence are astonishing, if not totally convincing. I just think
that 1) art is not essentially free expression of discontent (I know you
didn't say that anyway); and 2) sex is not exactly repressed content anymore
in our world.  It's become a repressive single-minded culture-ordering
conventionality.  O tempus, o mores, whatever that means.

Thanks, Nicole for your recap of the Cixous talk. My introduction to her
was through the Brazilian writer, Clarice Lispector, of whom she has
written a great deal. In fact, Cixous has seen her as an exemplary writer
of ecriture feminine. If you or others on the list have not read
Lispector, I would recommend her with as much enthusiasm as Cixous does.
Try _Selected Cronicas_, just out from New Directions.

Steven

I am one of the Sanskritists who responded to David Israel's query re this
term.  I'm not surprised that Kerouac didn't read Eliade, whose books on
yoga and shamanism appeared in accessible English editions only in the
sixties [although an early English edition appeared in 1958].

However, I am *very* surprised to hear that none of his confreres were
reading Eliade.  Besides the explicit reference to Eliade in Rothenberg's
1968 book, I recall discussions of archaic poetics which I had in the 70's
with Diane Di Prima, from which I got the impression that she, and her
confreres, were definitely familiar with Eliade. Perhaps my memory is
unreliable, or perhaps I was generalizing from what appeared to me to be
her obvious familiarity with Eliade's ideas.

I've just read the article and find it typically excellent on many counts;
especially in the way it contextualizes Yasusada through other Japanese
poets, it's pretty much an education in itself.  I _do_ think that some of
its argument regarding poetic identity is a bit strained, since the
editorial stances of _Arial_ and _APR_, for example, -- both of which
published Yasusada poems -- are quite divergent.  That strand of the
argument seems to me to have more to do with Marjorie's current concerns in
general than with the Yasusada issue in particular.

I would like to know what Kent Johnson (who's on this list) thinks of the
piece.  But given his generally nimble responses to queries on this score, I
don't imagine he'll be all that direct. ;-)

I have two other questions:

1) are the Yasusada poems going to be published in book form?  I would hope so.

2) what comparisons should be drawn between the Yasusada and the Sokal
affairs?

Cheers,
David

I can't answer number one except to say, I hope so too. As for number two,
I would just say there is one key difference: The poems of Yasusada
"fooled" the editors because they were good poems (I seem to remember Bob
Perelman's MLA paper addressing this issue in more historical detail than I
can muster). On the other hand, Sokal's _Social Text_ piece (should have)
embarrassed the editors because it is clearly not a compentently-written
article. Regardless, of whether Sokal only decided it was a hoax _post
facto_, as Andrew Ross maintains, it should never have been published in
the first place (and indeed, if the author had been a graduate student or a
physicist at North Dakota State or someplace as marginal, then if would
have been returned w/o a serious reading).

Poetas,

this morning, in a note anent Nicole Markotic's precis of Helene
Cixous' "paper presentation," I remarked (tangentially) --

> She seems to remind me a bit (or in a general way) of that other
> interesting academic experimentalist (so to say), Ann Carson . . .

Hugh Steinberg backchanneled a one-sentence (well, two sentence)
question, inquiring abt. said Carson.  I've written out a somewhat
rambling (but poss. useful withal) reply/ -- and it doesn't seem I'd
be breaching principles of nettiquette in this instance if I flip
this from back-channel to front-burner -- which I'll do only bec. I
like Carson's work and suspect others may share this interest.  I'm
sure there are apt to be others more versed in Carson than am I;  but
here's what little I know so far . . .

Hugh, --

you ask,
> Could you tell me more about Ann Carson?  Where to start, etc.

I'll tell you what bit I know, which is somewhat anecdotal.  First to
note, am quite sorry I missed a reading here in DC by Carson -- she
recently appeared at the rather distinguished venues (& pricy -- one
of few places that'll charge, I think, $12 for privilege of hearing a
poet): the Folger Shakespeare Library -- sharing the bill with
John Ashbery no less.

Anway, my encounters w/ Carson began when I chanced on her remarkable
book EROS:  THE BITTERSWEET at a booshop some six years ago.  I
browsed, purchased, read it thru, & straightaway read it thru a 2nd
time (rare for a slowish reader like me) --

I don't have a copy of this volume on hand at this point (and it's
been, now, some years since reading)  -- but Carson's EROS made an
impression, lingers in mind, and seems to bid for a further re-read.

The main topics are the "nature of":

  knowledge
  love
  reading
  writing

and to explore this terrain, Carson relies on sources from the
classical Greek (mostly) -- especially (as I recall) on both Socrates
and Sappho.  Her citations and elucidations of both of these (very
dissimilar) writers seem superb.  Also recall an interesting
discussion of a section of the Odyssey involving an anecdote that
seemed to reflect on the "nature of writing per se" -- or some such.

She translates and elucidates the poem from Sappho with image of an
apple on the high branch (beyond reach) to discuss the nature of
desire and its relationship to knowledge -- a fine discussion which
deepened my appreciation & regard for Sappho, must say.  Similarly,
her creative consideration of certain passages from Socrates seemed
both delightful & brilliant.

One felt, with this vol., that one was in the presence of a mind
discovering genuine things, making fine leaps, and sharing it all in
a way that proved neither off-putting (for its specificity) nor
muddled (for its breadth).  Poss. a  model of the book-length essay.

I next encountered Carson's work in the pages of *The American Poetry
Review.*  (If one were to pore over issues of that publication of the
past half-dozen years, I think one would find a number of items from
Ann Carson.  I've not, unfortunately, much kept up with APR in the
past couple years -- but I recall seeing two or three presentations
of Carson's work -- her translations as well as her own poems --
within the span of a year or two, prob. circa '93).

Carson's poems engaged (in at least one instance) the "idea of God"
in interesting & likeable (to me) ways.  Her translations seemed
rather quirky in (likewise) likeable ways -- for instance, I recall a
(supposed) translation that made reference to Deng Xiaoping and
tossed out some mention of "small bottle" (this would be a likely,
literal rendering of xiao-ping -- at least there is a xiao which
means small & a ping which means bottle) -- and now I'm not at all
sure whether this was (supposed to be) a "translation" from Chinese
or rather (equally likely) from ancient Greek!  (I think it was the
latter.)  Notwithstanding this playful sort of anachronism, I recall
being left with the impression of a lively (& "good") translation . . .

I've also seen -- somewher in some bookstore -- a cassette recording
of Carson's lecture on some or other classics topic (unfortunately
didn't snap it up).

Further:  In the [Village] Voice Literary Supplement -- abt. 3 years
ago? -- there appeared an article that amounted to an awestruck
appreciation of Carson's intellect & writing.  (This article may've
included some bit of an interview with her.)

Ann Carson is based at a University in Canada (McGill, I think),
where she's a professor of Classics.  From all evidence I've seen,
she's a new breed of classicist -- or perhaps a breed apart.

I look forward to further enjoyment of her writing; the above is what
I know at the moment.

best,
d.i.

Lemme preface this by disagreeing a but with Dave Zauhar on Sokal.  It
is a lot of things, but one thing it ain't is an incompetently written
article.  I agree that it should of course have been rejected, but the
fact that it wasn't has, as even Ross's self-justifying account of his
role in the fiasco suggested, a lot to do with the expectations created
by Sokal's position as physicist.  Sokal's hoax has different purposes,
of course, and it's not nearly as subtle as the Yasusada case, but I
think the differences there are of degree rather than kind.

Not so with Malley methinks.  First off, of course, Malley was created to
ridicule the editors of _Angry Penguins_ in a wholesale fashion, and the
poems were notoriously composed in -- what? -- an afternoon?  Yasusada
seems much more carefully constructed; it obviously took a long time to
put him together -- although both "poets" include clues to their
nonexistence in the poetic texts (and in Yasusada's case, in the notes and
English exercises in APR).  Further, Yasusada is _not_ lampooning
anything, at least as I understand that; he seems to exist more as an
insider critique, to raise questions rather than attack practices.

Another question about Yasusada comes to mind.  Perloff's article nicely
points out some words, like "scubadiver," in the poems that are obviously
anachronistic.  She also cites a poem dated 1945 that contains the term
"big bang".  Does anybody know when the term was coined?  Theories about
the universe expanding were based on Edmund Halley's observations and
arose I think in the late 1920's.  And the Catholic Church officially
embraced the Big Bang as a proof of God in 1951.  So when _did_ the term
arise?  If it's late (1945-1950, say) then "big bang" is also
anachronistic.

Cheers,
David

The Poet's Testament

I wrap the sky around myself
to keep away the cold
and eat starlight late at night
to take the place of rice.
Dewdrops scatter below the sky
for me to find and drink,
and out my poems flow
to greet the morn, to last the age.
My heart, sacrificed to its grave,
gains unworldly powers;
the spirit flies to lands of dreams
the far side of the sky.
It seeks divinity in Heaven
and brings it back to earth
to soothe the sand and grass,
bringing happiness, bringing peace.
My purpose in composing poems
is to salvage the soul.

-Angkarn Kalyanapong

translated by Allen Ginsberg.

I came across this translation in "Three Thai Poets", 1978,
Sathirakoses-Nagapradipa Foundation, Bangkok

In the preface, S. Sivaraksa states that Angkarn, Naowarat Pongpaibool and
Witayakorn Chiengkul partipated in ASEAN Poetry 78 held in Jakarta,
Indonesia that July.  Angkarn's expenses were, in part, defrayed by a Ford
Foundation grant. The Sathirakoses-Nagapradipa Foundation published the
bilingual "Three Thai Poets" (Thai-English) to mark the event.  The above
poem was first published in the Social Science Review of Silapakorn
University in 1962. The English translation also appeared in Tenggara
(Malaysia), Solidarity (Philippines) and Quadrant (Australia).  Does anyone
know the year it was translated (the year is not provided in this edition)?

Although the English translation does not take the traditional Thai form,
Ginsberg communicated the sentiment superbly, proving that it takes a poet
to translate one.

David, your memory of Anne Carson's _Eros: The Bittersweet_ is quite good.
I'm no expert on her or things Classical, but this is a book that I hope
to reread as well. I read this book in connection with a review I wrote of
her book _Plainwater_ which contains a stimulating mixture of poems and
essays. And it is delightfully never clear which is which. The review was
at the web site for the Boston Book Review, but I don't think it is there
anymore. For anybody who might want to read it, it's at my home page at
the address below. Click on "Reviews" when you get to the welcome page.
Here's two samples from _Plainwater_ (Knopf). The first doesn't do the
lines justice since they are in different type faces and sizes in the
book.


fr. 22
Half Moon

        He awakens early.

Half moon through the pines at dawn
        sharp as a girl's ribcage.



And the second sample from "Mimnermos: The Brainsex Paintings"


...I can't distill my history into this or that home truth and go plunging
ahead composing miniature versions of the cosmos to fill the slots in your
question and answer period it's not that I don't pity you it's not that I
don't understand your human face is smiling at me for some reason it's not
that I don't know there is an act of interpretation demanded now by which
we could all move to the limits of the logic inherent in this activity and
peer over the edge but everytime I start in everytime I everytime you see
I would have to tell the whole story all over again or else lie...


As I typed the above, I realized where some of the idea I had about
forgetting (or ignoring as Hugh suggested to me backchannel) and
individuation comes from.

Geez, I'm just full of recommendations today!

Yes, the immediate target of the Malley hoax was Max Harris and John Reed,
editors of _Angry Penguins_, although as McAuley and Stewart stated, they
were the epigones, in their view. Their real target was Herbert Read, as
critic/advocate of the avant-garde and the English Apocalyptic group. But
the hoax broke before the English half of the target could be drawn in.

But David's point about the careful construction of Yasusada vs. Malley
probably needs the rider that while the Malley poems were written in an
afternoon (apart from the first one, "Durer: Innsbruck 1495"), the context
was English Apocalyptic writing, latter-day surrealism, automatic writing
etc. That is, the chief virtue of the Malley poems as McAuley and Stewart
(the perpetrators) argued was that they were produced _without_ the
"sovereign  power of the shaping intellect." So it was exactly the free
play of the unconscious/imagination together with textual pastiche that
produced "hoax," that is, bad, poetry. The problem, of course, was that, as
Harris, Sidney Nolan, and many young Australian poets in the more than
fifty years since the hoax have recognised, it was exactly the eruption of
the unconscious (or whatever we want to term it) and the zany pastiche
(picked up by Kenneth Koch for _Locus Solus_ as a piece of [homoerotic?]
collaboration) that gave the poems their strange appeal and resonances (as
well as their bathetic clunks).

"Ern Malley" became, and remains, a kind of rallying point for radical
modernist, postmodern and avant-garde writing in Australia. For the
moralising anti-modernists of mid-century Australian literature, Ern Malley
represents the the possibility of an entirely amoral art. (Max Harris was
prosecuted for pusblishing obscene material, that is, poetry of
indeterminate meaning.) In a chapter I'm currently writing, I argue that in
fact Malley becomes the _authentic_ origin of Australian (post)modernism.

Anyone thinking of embarking on a hoax should study the reception of
historical hoaxes, they never seem to have quite the effects they were
designed to.

David Golumbia --

thanks for your detailed info abt. Stalker & Roadside Picknick -- I'd
never heard of the latter novel.  I guess Tarkovsky's films Stalker &
Solaris seem a pair -- a suite of two, so to say -- & hence my
(wrong) assumption abt. authorship of the novel behind the former
(since Lem had written the Solaris novel).

Speaking of Andre Tarkovsky, these literary references in his work
have especially interested me:

* in STALKER, he gives -- in mystic voiceover (I think while the
camera is doing slow pans of water & objects in water -- something
the camera does a lot of in this film; -- all this by way of giving
some sense of "what life is like" in "the ZONE) -- a few well-known
verses from the Tao Te Ching [Dao de Jing] attributed to Lao-Tse.

It's been years since I've seen the film (or read the TTC), but as I
recall, the lines quoted [w/o attribution] are those that compare the
Tao to water . . . noting water's pliancy, mobility -- it always
seeks the lowest place (etc.) . . .

* in THE SACRIFICE (which was Tarkovsky's final film -- he made 7
movies in his life, before succombing to cancer, in the mid-'80s) --
there's a curious and (I'd say) significant reference to the work of
Carl Jung.  One tends to feel a kinship w/ Jung (if not actual
influence) in Tarkovsky's work generally -- and in this late case,
one finds, it seems, a sort of hat-tip by the filmmaker, saying, in
effect: yes, it's to Jung that I'm referring here.  More
specifically, the anecdote in question is found in (if I recall
aright) a footnote in one of Jung's essays on the topic of
Synchronicity (CGJ's own coinage for what he termed "acausal
connections"; -- I don't much care for his "acausal" arguments -- he
was bending over backwards trying to justify basic subtle matters for
his skeptical rationalist milieu -- but anyway the material of
synchronicity is, even so, fascinating & important) . . .

anyway, early on in the movie, the postman -- who rides a bicycle and
delivers a medieval map of the world, as a birthday present  to the
eccentric chap whose birthday is to be celebrated in the course of
the weekend chronicled in the film -- this postman remarks that he is
a "collector of incidents."  What kind of incidents?, he's asked.  By
way of answer, he tell's Jung's anecdote.  He says, this is the sort
of incident I collect (& tells the tale).  The tale involves a woman
during the 2nd world war (early on), who went to have a photograph of
her son taken.  But due to war circumstances, she had to fell the
country the very next day, was separated from her son -- and never
had the film developed (it was abandoned with much else).  Years
later, in America, she sits for a photograph herself.  The photo is
developed, and it proves to be a double-exposure: her image is
combined with that of her son (the film having never been developed,
but, rather, re-used) . . .  the postman tells this story, as an
example of one of the many incidents he has "collected" (meaning, it
seems, researched & verified) -- and by this means, the filmmaker
serves to signal the viewer that THIS is close to the essential
matter to be delved into as the film unfolds . . . .

best,
d.i.

Dear DaVID

indeed that message was sposed to be backchannelled to you, and what I did
was reply to a message of yrs, and as it was addressed mainly to me, I
hadnt noticed that it was on the net, so it just goes to show: you never
can tell.

Dear George, University gets out so early in Canada, or is it only BC? When
I attended UBC, I was told we got out that early because we were wanted in
the forests to fell things. Was that T, or F? So these 3 weeks of hell open
upon a paradise of summer hols. What will you do with yourself now the
stake has gone thru the heart of another academic year? Travel? Lie on the
beach at Kits? Garden? Speaking of hearts, that was naughty of you to scarf
every last chocki & not save any for your sweetie. --Does Valentine's Day
fall six weeks later in Canada, the way your Thanksgiving is six weeks
earlier? It has to do with the northern seasons, I suppose. People's
plumbing stays frozen until April? F, T?

I'd meant to mention in my last response to David K. that for those
interested there
is an intelligent exchange about Yasusada in the recent issue of
the fine, upstart Countermeasures, and there is another
"introductory" article
in the November issue of Lingua Franca, and two pieces by Eliot
Weinberger in the VLS/Village Voice. There're some other things
from abroad too, which I can provide info on backchannel to those
interested. Chris Reiner's appropriatly samizdat-like Witz will be
publishing a long essay on AY by Mikhail Epstein, Russia's preeminent
critic of poetry, and Joe Napora's next BullHead will have a special
discussion section in their next issue, though the other special
section there on Jack Clarke will be just as or more important. The
Boston Review will have a number of people responding to Marjorie
Perloff's essay in their next issue, though I don't know who they
will be.

According to Timothy Ferris's book "Coming of Age in the Milky Way," the
term "Big Bang" was coined by astrophysicist and science fiction author
Fred Hoyle as a derisive commentary on Georges Lemaitre's theory that the
universe began as a singularity which erupted in what Lemaitre called the
"Big Noise" in a 1933 New York Times magazine article.  Unfortunately,
Ferris doesn't cite a date when Hoyle first used "Big Bang" in public.
Hoyle published his book on the steady state theory in 1948, so my hunch is
that it's not quite an anachronism.

Unfortunately Deanna Ferguson will not be able to appear
as advertised on the CCCP programme which Fiona Templeton
just posted, but there will be readings from her work
during the scheduled appearance time. _Salt_ will also
look to carry some of her poems next year. Talking of
_Salt_, I enjoyed the posting regarding Helene Cixous; the
August issue of _Salt_ carries (both in French & in trans-
lation) a fascinating piece called "Savoir" by Cixous,
which any "short-sighted" readers out there will especially
appreciate. Also, for those interested in progress reports re the
Folio(Salt) publication of J.H. Prynne's _Complete Poems_, we
have an Australian release date of late August and a US/UK release
date of late October. Fremantle Arts Centre Press are combining
with Folio on distribution so we'll get the book everywhere. Oh,
and great news, there's a new manuscript of Prynne's that Equipage
hopes to publish in time for the CCCP and that has also been included
in the Complete Poems - "For The Monogram". The opening epigram goes:
"Why should the dog ever be displeased _spontaneously_?" -- Leibniz,
_Theodicy_, intro. by Austin Farrer (1951).

As I believe the first editor to have published Yasusada I should chime in
that in fact I wasn't "fooled" precisely because the piece was so good. I
said so to a number of people at the time. There are moments in the piece
that are just a little too perfect, & the speakers a little too well informed
for no one in the community to have heard of them (that's how it struck me in
1990, anyway). I published it because I thought it good, discursively &
aesthetically, though I was quite curious about its origin. Oh, & it's
_Aerial_, not Arial-- which is actually a new one, usually people misspell it
Ariel.

Thanks to Rod Smith for the editor's eye view of the event. I'd just like
to point out that I put scare quotes around "fooled" to account for what
were obvously a wide range of reactions to subsequent revelations, as well
as to a variety of possible initial responses upon first encountering the
poems. Not very precise, but I had just gotten home from a 6-7 hour happy
hour. However, I stand by my initial assessment of Sokal's article, in
spite of not having access right now to Social Text to help me make my
case.
        Finally, I wonder if anyone has ever thought about how one's
perception that a poet might be an invention alters perception of the work.
Ted Berrigan and Ron Padgett (according to Padgett's memoir) assumed that
F.T. Prince was such a poet. I remember reading _Ted_ when it came out then
looking for Prince's work, and upon finding it, being convinced that Prince
was another Ern Malley, so much so that when I encountered his entry in a
DIctionary of Literary Biography, my first reaction was to say, "ha, fooled
them!"  But as the artist currently known as F.T. Prince put it:
"To the vigilance of my exertions a lax pause"

no quite the opposite actually: it encourages one to be aware (dare i say
sensitive?) to the permutations of difference and the difficulties of
making ethno-assumptions.  i dont apologize for an "intellectualized"
answer and i dont accept as "evasive" an attempt to separate the wheat
from the chaff--as it were.  your point of addressing "the positions of
race as they function" is taken to heart--however much the criticism of
"cerebral--distant--contemplation" is inaccurate.  i like to think of my
self as somewhat influenced by enlightenment practices: the general AND
the particular.

this two statements evoke for me precisely the difficulties i mentioned
in my post: that the racialized body is both a sign of ethnicity but
problematically ambiguous.  to which i suggested that our language for
talking about this is simply not adequate to the experience and the
experienced experience of race--which is to say that we are saying the
same thing in different words.  but while you alluded to this ambiguity
of race you also insist upon it--which is not to say you are inconsistent
but that the language of race necessitates both an attention (as you say)
to the lived experience of race but (as i say) an attentiveness to where
that language fails to address the ambiguities complexities difficulties
of differences.

i hope youre not making assumptions about race on-line: its hard to see
not to mention the fact that the inscription of race on the body is
itself always subject to interpretive ambiguity.

well referring to my post as "vague conceptual terms" that are
"dismissive and casual" in favor of a rather sentimentalized language of
the "heart" whose idiom is "personal experience" runs the risk not
only of alienating your interlocutor but of particularizing any discussion of
race into an my experience versus youre experience.  a rather habermasian
dilemma if i do say so.

in the end this post raises these thoughts for me: first that i hope that
i didnt seem too harsh in my original look at the use made of "white
guys."  second that an idiom mediating particularized languages of
experience--the "heart"--and the "intellectualized" analysis of such
epistemo-linguisitc concepts is necessary.

This is partly a test to see if this gets on before three messages I
posted last night do. But while I'm testing, I thought I'd ask if
anyone else found the B&B sex-play repartee over the past few months
to be very suspicious. I, for one, do. In fact, I'm convinced these
witty and sexed-up massages (oops, I meant E), are encrypted and hide
more serious meanings, and I've begun to go back
over them, using a variety of cryptographic techniques, including
some of the methods pioneered by de Saussure in his late hunts for
anagrams embedded into Latin verse. So far, I have been stymied, but
I do think a broadly anagrammatic approach is the key (reading
backwards and acrostically, I am now satisfied, is barking up the
wrong tree).

If anyone shares my concern, or has suggestions on reading techniques
that might prove fruitful, please let me know. The truth is that
this little game has gone on for too long. And the use of erotic
longing to obscure real motives only ends up cheapening sex.

I've just had the rather odd experience of going directly from the
conference on the construction and possible undoing of whiteness held at
Berkeley to the meeting of the College Language Association in Atlanta,
and will, as several have asked me to do, provide BRIEF reports on both in
the coming days --

The conference on whiteness turned out to be the most ethnically and
racially integrated academic conference I have ever attended -- On the
other hand, white academics continue to absent themselves from the
meetings of the College Language Association -- whatever we might think of
race in America, it's clear that many people who might be considered
"white" choose their company in the same old ways --

More directly to Hoa Nguyen's questions --

_If _Race Traitor_ were only arguing the social construction of race there
would be considerably less controversy about their platform -- I would
second the note that you might try to get the Routledge collected traitors
at your nearby university library --

BUT also -- last year in the _American Quarterly_, Shelly Fisher Fishkin
offered, with bibliography, a fairly accurate summary of the recent
critical and socio/political works examining the evolution of "whiteness"
in American culture -- I can get the exact citation for you if you want me
to (could perhaps even mail you a xerox, since I have it here somewhere
in these piles of books) --

David, thank you for the technical term for what I was describing :
"repressive desublimation".  I'm glad you were reading your Marcuse back
in the 60s.  Too bad the best you can do after 30 years is a feeble
one-liner. That's called Marcusing time, if you want to make puns.

also Romanian).  Unsolved murder in Chicago. Myth is murder, according
to Prof. Girard.  What say, ethno-poeticians?

Glad someone pointed that out; but still, the surfer idea leads to

we know "cruiser" won't work; nor "sailor" -- but there must be

just thought I'd land ashore here for a brief comment . . . ")

there's IDLING (as what a car does, when it's not engaging the road,
but is still running); -- then, what is it when one looks out the
window & takes in the scenery? -- there's scanning (but this already
has its techn-meanings); snooping (naw); scoping (?); smelling the
coffee / sniffing the flowers, sauntering the walkway, walking the
dog, reading the funny papers . . .  lot of verbs & objects . . .

I've been high-beaming thru this listserv for a while, and thought
I'd just brake to say . . .    okay, back to beamin' . . .

I've no idea what Girard might mean by that (nor who that Prof. may
be, for that matter); but it's interesting that Eco (w/ his "Name of
the Rose" interest in intrigues) would unearth -- and so
provacatively -- broadcasst this (poss. "real life") tale -- a thing
one wd. think old Umberto would decidedly NOT do except if he felt
there were (likely?) something to it.

as I recall (from suburban televideo upbringing), the haploid/hapless
quasi-antihero Maxwell Smart once mentioned a method he'd tried
applying to a suspect novel: reading every 3rd word.  His success,
it seems, was little better than that you report.  And to boot, he
found it partricularly hard to follow the storyline that way.

But your post calls to mind the 1st paragraph of William Gass's
interesting-looking essay in the April issue of Harper's. (I read
only the first few paragraphs while eating my brown rice in Union
Station . . . so can't vouch for the bonafides of the whole essay) --
this is the 1st essay Gass has had in Harper's Magazine since an
excellent one back in '94  . . . .

There was a feature on this in the Chicago Reader several months ago.

Am not an ethno-poetician (at least I don't think I am) but if myth is a
form of societal dreaming, it's reasonable to assume some of those dreams
will be nightmares.

I was so glad when george posted & didnt say the reason we'd been
cheapening sex lately was cause as old farts we have to pay too much for
it. George can be very vulgar, & that is certainly vulgar. But george, I
think its best to admit our code isnt Korean, its Canadian, eh? And its
best to admit we bin caught w our pants round our ankles. Its a first
offense, & i think we should throw ourselves on the mercy of the court. I
intend to talk abt how busy i've bin w civic duties of late, writing
letters to the local papers & going to weekly meetings and stomping the
precincts to prevent the wrongful annexation of orchard-land to build an
industrial park on the edge of town, how i had to make a speech to the
Local Agency Formation County Organization while they were all doing good
imitations of my firstyear students during Melville, how we had to put on a
mixer/art auction to raise money to pay for the lawsuit and how i've been
gathering stuff for the yardsale next weekend, humping mattresses into
flatbed trucks, for the same purpose, against big odds: 4 of the 5 city
council members cldnt be more for it if they were in the pockets of the
developer (i'm probably speaking metaphorically about now, the council is
too big for that),  and theres a law now that allows the city cxouncils to
pass on the costs of any lawsuit to the developer, which is a bad law
because it encourages the council to vote irrespnsibly, as they did in this
case, the EIR is the most flawed i've ever seen, the traffic engineer in
reporting that the 2500/day extra cartrips this industrial park will
generate. neglected to factor in that each year, an extra 880 car trip/p.d.
go thru Sebastopol. And the waste storage ponds planned wont be nearly
large enough to contain effluent from the parkinglots once the big storms
hit in the winter.Its ribbon development, which our recently approved
General Plan forbids, meanwhile theres an industrial park already built 43
miles away in Santa Rosa w plenty of empty buildings, and I cd go & on
about this, not my first venture into grassroots politics, but i wont,
because who wants long postings, and also because i want to address your
defense, George, you must tell of how hard you work at SFU, and of needing
at the same time to be nursing your wife as you are doing thru a serious
illness, while traveling the world in behalf of Canadian Lit; and how all
this hard work, requiring stern sublimation, made us crack up : and then we
just throw ourselves on the magistrate's mercy & hope he hasnt recently
been made to look foolish in public by a colleague on some judicial matter
in such a way that he's looking for some easy butt to kick.  I'd say its
always best to make a clean breast of it, but I'm worried that the
superfluous sexual energy encoded in language would render that cliche, in
context, suspect. But in any case, George, we must see to it that our
heavily (but not heavily enough) encrypted desire for one another is kept
strictly in the back channels henceforth. We wouldnt want the Listmaster, a
man notorious for his playlessness, and who always stands by the fixed
meanings he imparts to his words, delivering an officious censure to us on
the parade ground. Au revoir, cherie--j'embarrass ton rep. db.

I regret last post of mine.  Sorry, David B., for the bile. & sorry list
for having to listen in.  DB has started me thinking about this in a new way.

Re; Eliade article - sorry, David I., I can't give you more specifics - I
think it was in the latest or next-to-latest NY Review of Books.  And
Eco didn't unearth the story - he's just reviewing a book about it by a
Romanian author.  "Myth is murder" is just shorthand for Rene Girard's
massive all-encompassing theory of human culture & nature.  He theorizes
that the roots of human culture & even intelligence (by way of the ability
to name & make distinctions) is rooted in "mimetic desire" (the desire for
something the value of which is enhanced only because someone ELSE has it).
That in social situation this triangle leads to endless back-&-forth feuding,
& cultures solve this problem via the scapegoat mechanism; that underlying
all culture-organizing myths lies mob violence & the scapegoat victim - myths
are a kind of utilitarian bad faith or disguise which promote the victim to
culture hero & thus salve the guilt of the community & maintain the system
at the same time.  Girard argues that Biblical religion exposes this mechanism
& thus opens the possibility for breaking the vicious circle via understanding.
I think there is some truth to the idea - paralleled in a purely literary sense
in Auerbach's thesis that the Bible began our sense of "ordinary reality"
in literature - that the Bible represents a comic, de-glorified divinity -
subversive to mythology.  There are a ton of books about all this.
(One could argue though that some forms of Christianity - & probably
other religions too - try to have it both ways, & the circle goes on).
But I agree with Walt Whitman, folks: Let's Not Argue About Religion.

this would really be interesting, since Kelley is an historian

jeffrey and dale: it's a truism by now that race is socially constructed.
however, there are real privileges (for white folks) and
disenfranchisements (for folks of color) assigned to those various social
constructions.  so to use the "construction" argument as to deny the real
effects of racism and the real privileges of whiteness is a real problem.
most of the "white" critical race theorists who are problematizing
"whiteness" are doing so not to avoid taking responsibility for their
privilege but precisely to take responsibility and take steps, as aldon
pointed out in his "whatness of whiteness" post, to dissolve its mystical
powers of privilege-granting.  it is this taking responsibility that seems
a little lacking in your posts, jeffrey.  what you say about construction
is true, but to use that argument to deny the material/ experiential
effects of racism on people of color seems...well...evasive, as if you feel
personally attacked and need to defend yourself.  there's a wonderful
article by george lipsitz in American Quarterly about a year ago, where he
coins the term "possessive investment in whiteness" and explains how gov't
policies that started in Roosevelt's time have affected the gap in life
opportunities,material wellbeing, etc. between whites and blacks.  this
takes the argument out of the psycho-emotional "i feel hurt that i'm being
charged w/ racism just cuz i appear to be white" realm that makes so many
otherwise wellmeaning white people balk at a serious study of white
privilege.  being jewish (not technically, as my mother wasnt, but
identifying as such) in america has complicated this issue for me.  in
europe, where most american jews came from, weren't white. here, we are.
so here, we have to take responsibility for our white privilege without
forgetting that it's a contingent category. we're "honorary whites," or
"sort-of" white, or "white for now." it points up exactly how arbitrary the
categories are.  but --i can get a loan for a house no problem, i can buy
property in certain parts of town, it was assumed i'd go to college (and i
did), etc. etc. blah blah blah. i'm babbling now.  no offense meant; just
an intervention, perhaps inappropriate.

Eco article is in April 10, 1997 issue of NYRB. It's called "Murder in

could, but as Nixon reminded us: "That would be wrong." God, I hope that
was Nixon and not Carter. Or Gore. My quote machine has been a rye lately.

NYRB dated April 10, the "Spring Books Issue. The book under review by
Eco is _Eros, Magic, and the Murder of Professor Culianu_ Northwestern U
press. The author is Ted Anton who I believe is at Depaul University and
not Romanian. Eliade's connection with the fascist Romanian Iron Guard
and Culianu's attempt to come to terms with this is part of a sordid
reconstruction of events that led to his execution style killing. Eco, I
guess had some brief connection with Culianu, but the review is rather
flat, taking the book to task for tending toward the sensational.
Although its hard to see how this story could be anything less, even if
it is, in the last instance, simply the banal evil of Ceausescu-esque
censorship of Romanian dissent.

I really look forward to Philip Read's writing on the Malley thing, which
has always struck me as fascinating....I'd like to point out what I
consider a neat (in several senses) parallel instance.

I still feel that perhaps I disagree with most posters here, on Perelman's
Marginalization, including Susan in her excellent discussion (I got Witz
on Saturday--Thanx, Chris Reiner!)...In the sense that I read the tone of
the book as less putting-down of many of the poets discussed, than others
do......But here I'd like to point out one of my favorite passages in the
book, where BP discusses a poem (in Writers & Poets magazine?) which was
intended as an angry debunking of LongPo..Like the Malley poets, the
author stressed that the short lyric was written without effort or
revision, in (in her case) a few seconds.  Perelman demonstrates
(correctly, in my opinion) that the poem shoots its author in the foot in
just the way the Malley work has often been thought (by their opponents)
to shoot its authors...The lyric can be read as quite intelligent,
entertaining and meaningful.  I rather like it, myself.  Its author may
have been demonstrating precisely the opposite of what she intended
(namely, that non-mainstream "avant-garde" styles are inherently
meaningless and worthless ways to write verse)..At the very least (and
this is what I always thought the Malley affair represented) the "parody"
language poem shows that parodic attack never demolishes a poetic style
you dislike..... the only people who will "see the light" in response to
your parody will be the folks who already agreed with your loathing of
the style...

Along these lines Noel Ignatiev (co-editor of _Race Traitor_) published
_How the Irish Became White_ examining in fine historical detail the
dynamic M. Damon refers to.

_Race Traitor_'s subhead is "a journal of the new abolitionism". It is
theoretically eclectic in its treatment(s) of social construction-ism.
however it is precisely about active and activist attempts at
confronting the very real manifestations of racism, rather than the
straw-man dance around 'PC', multi-cultural-ism etc. and other bugbears
that lather up discussions of injured liberal locus communis. One of the
journal's strengths is the space given to young folks.

Subject:      who is social, individual, or a writer
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Actually, I think Henry Gould and some others are missing the
implications of Jefferson Hansen's suggestion that writing is a social
rather than individual phenomena, and I want to elaborate on the reasons
I'm with Jeff on this one.

        Historically, inside the traditions of western philosophy and
culture, to speak very generally, the "individual" refers to the idea that
the human being has a single, unified consciousness that exists without
any level of social mediation--individuals are BORN as themselves, as
unified, and then come into contact with a social environment. There is a
lot of writing that takes apart this notion of the individual--I'm not
sure I want to say more here than that the work of Foucault and many
others focuses on how the notion of the individual IS ITSELF A SOCIAL
CREATION.

        But let's assume, for the moment, that Henry's evocation of the
"individual" is a less naive notion; that what he means, rather, is that
despite the various levels of social interaction to which individuals are
subjected (and to which they respond in and perhaps beyond that
subjection), there still remains a PARTICULAR vision that comes forth from
this particular consciousness, which marks that consciousness as
individual in the sense that its ideas and productions are exactly that,
PARTICULAR. This seems perhaps a more workable notion of the individual as
existing in a kind of social specificity that is not totally accountable
to group consciousness.

        That might seem a better notion of the individual, except that it
seems to me that there is a further problem. WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE THAT
SOME PART OF A WRITER'S PRODUCTION MAY COME FROM A UNIQUE PLACE THAT
CANNOT WHOLLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY AN EXAMINATION OF THAT WRITER'S SOCIAL
FRAME, IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PARTICULARITY CAN BE MARKED
AS A KIND OF SINGULAR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT COULD BE TERMED INDIVIDUAL. That
is, if some part of consciousness and production remains opaque to,
resistant to, unreclaimable by the contextualization of a social frame,
there is equally no proof that this "resistant" proportion of productive
consciousness has anything unified about it. In fact, the attempt to
describe this fundamentally opaque site, whose status cannot be determined
except through the language to which it remains opaque, as a notion of
INDIVIDUALITY is precisely an attempt to unify it, unless one wants to
retain the term "individuality" to apply to something not singular, not
unified, and resistant to description. But it seems to me that
"individuality" is by no means sufficent to describe such a field of
activity, especially as it is a term already compromised by its prior use
as a notion of unified, non-social consciousness that is central to the
mechanics of late capitalist cultural domination.

        Of course, whether such a field of activity really exists as
resistant to the social is itself an intensely important question. I would
take Jeff to mean, in this case, that such a site of resistance, were it
to exist or not, DOES NOT FORM A SIGNIFICANT GROUND FROM WHICH THE
ACTIVITY OF WRITERS FOR INSTANCE EMERGES. Its opaqueness to the social
either does not exist at all, or is no more than an undifferentiated
residue which is at best a minor and indecipherable part of the creative
process, especially when compared to the power of social ideology. I
suppose the signficance of this opaque site to creativity could be
debated, but again, I see no way to describe it as "individual," because I
see no way to think of it as a site of any sort of unified consciousness.

        Clearly, the history of 20th century philosophy, psychoanalysis,
and cultural studies (and how all these fields are also altered by
feminism) has been much taken with this history of the status of the
subect and its (potential?) residues.

        There are no individuals.

In my opinion...Well, there are some very long possible answers.  The
short answer in my opinion is: because world (stalinist) Communism was so
central to the left, many serious attempts at building a sort-of-socialist
alternative include old CP'ers.  For the most part, it's nothing more
significant (or sinister) than that.  This was true of the New American
Movement in the 1970's, a socialist party of some promise that melded into
DSOC to creat DSA (and the promise faded); and of many other similar
groupings.  One constant in doing political work from 1968 to the present
is, that you find people with this kind of background among the most
committed and constant activists you're working with.

first post on this)--Because it might help us reach many of the working
people who still think the Republicrat structure is the one way to work if
you are going to be "realistic".  But if instead you want to try founding
another flaming red revolutionary grouping, please be my guest.  I might
join!  But I myself work full time or more at a day job, do labor
activism, and consider my work as a poet and editor to my my "real" life's
work--I can't quite manage the energy to found my own party!  So I support
any initiative that MIGHT move us forward..And like the Jesse Jackson
campaigns AT FIRST (I hasten to add) the NP looks like it MIGHT have some
small contribution to make in this direction.  You work with the left you
have; and I have always felt that the truely best left would be: 1.
revolutionary; and 2. very much NON-leninist.  As no such formation now
exists that in my opinion is any good, I lend my support to whatever
flawed initiatives I see people attempting out there.

I wonder if you (or anyone, really) can direct those of us
who are not familiar with the Ern Malley affair (which
does have a distinctly Victorian ring, thus put) to a few
salient (primary &/or secondary) sources. I assume there's
a lot of writing on this one out there, somewhere, but
possibly in more fugitive publications, & so not, for instance,
indexed in the MLA database.

interesting; i went to stanford as a grad student partly cuz i was so taken
w/ girard's work; then when i got there, i tried to sit in on a few classes
of his and just couldn't, for reasons mentioned below.  everything came
back to the same old story, which ratified Christianity.  he was/is a
charming character however, with a very large, large head.  his two
mantras, to be said in a heavy french accent were, "Very strannnnnge!" and
"But it's so obvioos!" accent on the last syllable of obviooos.  These two
descriptors applied to every anthropological anecdote at his disposition;
first strange, then, with the application of his theory, rendered "so
obvioos."

This is another test. One of my messages posted yesterday and
three from day before have vanished. One a response to David Kellog's

'The only people who will "see the light" in respondse to your parody will
be those who already agreed with your loathing of the style.' Hallelujah,
Mark Prejsnar, I couldnt agree more. Would add, however, that "seeing the
light" isnt the only pleasure one can take in a parody. One can enjoy
"Burnt Norton" and still enjoy "Charred Whitlow" (by Henry reed, is it? Too
busy or lazy to look it up). I've seen parodies of writers I greatly admire
that have been outrageously funny. It seems to me its something akin to the
potential funniness of names--parody can throw limitation into a new light,
we see the something mechanical about style, and Bergson in "On Laughter"
makes sense to me when he remarks that one thing that can be funny is when
human beings act in a mechanical way.Or the comedy routine is "a
machine"...Chaplin appears, theres an open hole in the street, we know its
only a matter of time before he falls down it . . that example is likely
from someone other than Bergson, huh? Cant recall my source there, sorry.
Any style has the limitations of its virtues, and if a parody can detach us
from its charisma for a moment, we can laugh at it without, however,
"seeing the light" & expunging that poet or that poem from our hearts.(I
recall the thread on the List months since, concerning "Stopping by Woods"
being sung to the tune of "Hernando's Hideaway". Poems from _The Shropshire
Lad_ too, I think Bowering posted in, cd also go to that tune.) One of my
favorite parodies is by Kenneth Koch, and has fun with WCW's "This is just
to say" : "This is just to say/ I'm sorry I broke both yr arms at the dance
last night/ but I wanted you on the wards, where _I_ am the doctor." The
chief problem w the parody Bob P alludes to, is that it isnt a good parody.
It's not well-written. And given its authorship, how cd it have been? Even
that is faintly funny.  db.

gone for weekend, glad to get back to all these interesting messages.


>They (the NP) seem in my experience to be

>**real** working class people of all races.

not sure what to make of this claim.  the new party's base seems to be
primarily in the intelligencia at this point.  the philly branch of the
labor party (detroits is also pretty successful) has succeeded in
umbrella-ing a wide variety of activist groups LED by poor people.

>Why do you see the new

>hope, or do you mean that a political party in this country firmly
>grounded in working class organizations is an absolute prerequisite
>grounded in working class organizations is an absolute prerequisite
>for smashing the rule of capital?

here the latter is the crux of the matter.  people who have nothing to
lose are less likely to compromise with the present system.  while i like
the new party's ideas, (see the following)

>Their (NP)platform is in flux and very vague, which has pissed off lots of
>people on the left, and led to many attacks.  The NP says that this is
>because ultimately they want the folks who are building the party to draw
>up its detailed credo,

if they do not succeed in overturning the fusion thing, they may not make
it electorally.  if they overturn the anti-fusion thing, but only mostly
have the intelligencia behind them, then it is possible that (see following)

>the NP is going to repeat the trajectory of Democratic
>Socialists of America, and become a sunday tea-club entirely subservient
>for all practical purposes to the Democratic wing of the Republicrats, and

as for the labor party . . . .

>until their naitonal leadership wholly endorses
>activism/membership by folks outside certified union locals, and commits
>to running its own cadidates, it remains a pretty limited option for most
>of us...

they ARE committed to running their own candidates, but only after they
have built a larger and INDEPENDENT funding base.  projected start date:
3 years.  thus the following statement

>considerable reason that as long as it says it is a "party" but won't
>field its own cadidates, it is going to be simply a wing of the Clintonian
>ultra-right Demos,

is false.

the NP's ideas and efforts are commendable and have potential,
but the future is unclear. at some point labor movements such as
the one in philly, which consists mostly of groups that are poor-led and
poor-organized and strives for independent funding, may be a necessary
alternative.  they are highly organized and quite serious and
quite clear about how *they, personally* are getting fucked over.  this
summer some members plan to march  from the liberty bell to the united
nations.  last summer they marched from the liberty bell to
harrisburg(which is a lot farther than the UN).  against (economic) human
rights abuses in USA.  unfortunately our local news doesnt like to give
them any press . . . .  let alone getting an article in *the nation*.

it seems to me that "individuality" is by no means sufficent to
describe such a field of activity, especially as it is a term already
compromised by its prior use as a notion of unified, non-social
consciousness that is central to the mechanics of late capitalist
cultural domination... I see no way to describe it as "individual,"
because I see no way to think of it as a site of any sort of unified
consciousness...There are no individuals."

Perhaps the word "individuality" is the real problem here.  There's a
great number of writers/thinkers who attempt to posit selfhood as
"not singular, not unified, and resistant to description."  For instance
Emerson: "I know better than to claim any completeness for my
picture. I am a fragment and this is a fragment of me."  Or Creeley:
"I am struck by the situation of schizophrenia wherein the
experience of body may so place the hands or feet or anus in the
consciousness so affected, that no communal agreement as to their
location is possible."  These seem to me attempts to posit a self
which is both contingent and multiple, and certainly resistant to
description, description not only of "individuality" but also any
description which would merely collapse self into a particular
collective.  I would argue that these kinds of positionings are both
infused with social consciousness and highly resistant of any
attempts to construct something resembling, say, "rugged
individualism."

Try buying a house in Tuxedo Park or Lake Forest. Institutional antisemitism

Here's a quaint bit of white American folklore that I've known all my life

Silly me. I've always thought that, though I live in the social world, blah
blah blah, how I make my way through it might be different, individual, even
if there's no such person as the unsocialized urperson. To say that all of
my significant movements are in detail socially determined sounds an awful
lot like recycled calvinism. This may be naive (I love the use of naive as
an expletive).
Of course, none of these assertions are "proveable." It's entirely possible

Subject:      Re: who is social, etc.

The position opened by Jeff & enlarged upon by Mark is one I have a hard
time understanding!  Of course there's been a ton of critical theory
on the "place" where the "subject" swerves off into ambiguity, or the
Other, or the self-contradictory; and in a time of "identity politics"
as well as commodified "personal" poetry, the idea that the individual
is not only not important but does not exist holds, I suppose, a certain
gleam of provocative interest.  Moreover, as I understand the poetic
process, it's certainly not just a matter of "self-expression" or
self-imitation - it's an exploratory breaking-down & reconfiguring.
"You must lose yourself to find yourself", as the proverb goes.

But how does this theory relate, say, to the news report this week,
who knows how accurate it is, about a recent scientific study that
advances the notion that the skills which activate human intelligence
are instilled by age one & based on the amount of spoken interaction
the child has with loving parents?  I suppose you could read this
either way - but what does it mean for Mark's "power of social ideology"
if the child is primed for it by age one?

In my view individuality is not a phenomenon in isolation, & has never been
described as such in classical philosophy, as Mark claims.  "Man is the
civic animal."  (Aristotle)  "Man is the companionable animal." (Dante)
How's that for classics?  But the reification (in ideology) of "social
forces" to the point of nullifying the sense of individuality seems
way off base to me.  The whole trend of our century has been toward these
totalizing ideas and against the concept of the Person.  My own PERSONAL
viewpoint is that individuality is the GIST, the very TASTE of the SALT OF
THE EARTH which brings the DIGNITY of the PERSON to the POINT, the ESSENCE
of political efficacy & meaning - and that this DIGNITY of the HUMAN PERSON
is the shadow of the DIVINE ANALOGY which the unity of the HUMAN RACE
displays in all its glory.  HUMANITY is the living MANIFESTATION of the
DIVINE IMAGE.  Thank you, & good night. & don't leave out the dolphins, neither

does expletive mean simply pejorative?  i didn't think so. i thought it had
a more specific meaning which wd make the term "naive" not an expletive.
can some etymologist or grammarian explain what, exactly, an expletive is?

Yup--I agree with this....Much the point, in some ways, of the instances
people have been discussing (not Yasusada, but the others): try to use
parody as a cudgel and it tends to ricochet back at ya...But within a
community of shared concerns, it can be illuminating play.

Kristin--

You may be overgeneralizing from your local experience...Some NP chapters
seem to be less exclusively "intellectuals" than the one you've
encountered..But that's just as impression.  Certainly I'll say this: the
day I replied to Kent's initial posting, I happened to get a call from a
NP person, a rather arrogant and ignorant fellow, practising what was
well-critiqued in a Nation article a year or two ago as "boiler-room
leftism"--i.e. "We don't care what you feel or believe or if you're an
activist or want to be...Just give us a bunch of your spare money,
preferably enough to be a paper member of our organization."  He actually
read to me from his little sheet that they have ten thousand members and
hope to have 20,000 within a year...Needless to say, all but 200 or 300 of
these are on paper, not active, just as with DSA.  So I think I can agree
with you and others who have suggested that the NP is very likely to have
problems.  I ESPECIALLY agree with your comment that without a legal
victory in the fusion case before the Supreme COurt right now they won't
have that well-grounded a tactical approach, and will falter..

I'm very excited about your comments re the Labor Party, Kristin;  the
things you write about their presence and activities in Philly are very
encouraging indeed..Thanx for the comments and information

I'd agree, and add that the emphasis of the "civic" which Henry cites has
*at least* as dubious a history as any emphasis of individuality one can
find.  It accounts for what Cornel West has called "the metaphysical
residues in Marx: the Hegelian-inspired penchant toward totalizing
history, universalizing collectivities, and simplifying emancipation."
I'd suggest that one doesn't have to have a unified sense of the
individual in order to reject these "metaphysical residues," residues
which I think have been profoundly harmful to both "individuals" and their
various collectives.

I canna resist emphasizing a little further.  If you deny individuality
exists in the writing process, you might as well deny the importance
or even existence of individuality per se.  Is this what you're saying?

Nothing personal - but I find this a malignant doctrine.  Deny the existence
of the individual & you might as well start the train cars rolling for the
camps.  Nothing personal - I sense from M & J's posts over the years that
you are both young serious-minded fellows of good character & strong
feeling & ideals - maybe you even look alike!!! But this retread of
the negation of the human individual comes from reading too many
books in political science, fellas.  & you is wrong.

Now please don't accuse me of heatin' up the rhetoric, cause I ain't.
I just look at Stalinism & Fascism & all manner of superior authoritarian-
isms & hear the same noises.  & I agree in advance that Individualism could
also become some kinda twisted anti-human ideology. & profit & property
have justified their stealth on half-notions of the individual.  But

identified as Mark Prejsnar.  Read same on plane back to San Ho, and want
to commend them to your collective and perhaps occasionally individual
attentions.  #1 includes some intriguing poetry by one "Cal Taubman" who
may or may not be a real "person" but whose poems I liked much -- also
Mark's reviews of two recent Sun & Moon anthologies and several journals
and web sites.  #2 ("incomprehension is the subtitle") has some good Mark
P. poems, the journal watch & "surfing for poetry" features and other
delectables --

$3.50 will get you a four issue sub. to this newsletter (you don't have to

OK:
expletive. n. 1. An exclamation or oath, especially one that is profane
or obscene. 2a. A word or phrase added to a line of verse or a sentence
in order to ease syntax or rhythm but not to add any meaning. b. a word
that stands in place of and anticipates a following word or phrase; for
example, the word _it_ is an expletive in the sentence _It is nice to see
you._
~adj. Also expletory. Added or inserted in order to fill out something,
such as a metrical line or a sentence. [Late Latin _expletivus_,from
Latin _expletus_, past participle of _explere_, to fill out' _ex-_, out +
_plere_, to fill.
                [Tormont Webster's Illust. Encyclopedic Dict.]
How's them apples?
[or,
"A former pletive--like, a former pletive spaghetti." --Iron Jay]

I have to agree with Gould.  I should keep my trap shut on this.  I'm no
philosopher.  But to say that individuality does not exist in the writing
process fails to acknowledge, to my mind, deeper manifestations of human
individuality outside the act of writing.  Even if some one conclusively
proved that the individual is a social construction, so what?  That should
feed the individual with even deeper personal insights into his or her
relationship with a larger group.  With writing--with any creative act--a
person takes action due to a personal impulse, a will to engage something
outside the self.  I'm sure one's will consists of more than only social
conditioning.  But even if it didn't, that would be all the more reason for
the individual to engage the world with all of his or her idiosyncratic,
chaotic, and impulsive gestures.  It's been a while since I read it, but
isn't that similar to the situation of Dostoevsky's character in Notes from
Underground?  In the end I feel that, as Pound said, it's better to gamble
an opinion than to humbly submit to that with which you disagree.  Anyway,
that's my two cents, for what it's worth. I don't like these kinds of
theoretical gambits, but I believe these discussions should take place on
occasion to help possibly clarify, if only to ourselves, our own pretenses
for writing at all.

Subject:      re-post re: Yasusada

I had sent the below as a reply to David's Kellogg's query on future
book publication of Yasusada. It (with three other posts, including
a crucial update on the B&B decoding which I'm also going to re-type)
never got on the list after numerous tries, so I think the original
is somehow corrupted--thus my
re-typing without David's original message titled "Re: Perloff on
Yasusada." It's transparently obvious to me now that B&B are working
directly with Joel Kuszai, or else they have somehow infected the
sending function of my machine. I've just installed a new anti-jamming
system, so maybe I'll get around them this time...

On 4/19 David wrote in part:
"I would like to know what Kent Johnson (who's on this list) thinks
of the piece [Marjorie Perloff's Boston Review essay]. But given his
generally nimble responses to queries on this score, I don't imagine
he'll be all that direct.... Are the Yasusada poems going to be
published in book form? I would hope so."

I replied:

David:
Doubled Flowering: From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada, will be
published by James Sherry's Roof this fall--the complete
manuscript of poems, letters, and marginalia, along with a "critical
appendix." But I have to ask what you mean by my "generally nimble
responses to queries on this score," since the truth is that no one
has ever asked me anything on this list and thus I have responded to
nothing! On the Sokal thing, it's the hope of those involved in the
Yasusada that it won't be reduced to that level. Yasusada is much
more than a trick.

Heyward's book is strong on archival and original research, but not so
strong on readings of the poems and the cultural signficance of Malley. See
my review article:
"Cultural Pathology: What Ern Malley Means," _Australian Literary Studies_
17.1 (May 1995): 83-88. If this is difficult for any interested US readers
to track down, please backchannel to me personally.

I tried to send this the back way but got it thrown back, so might as
well do it up front. (jr)

dear Henry Gould --

I thought your letter on the question of the individual was right on --
a defense, I take it, of what has long been an endangered species.  And
on the matter of what �ethno-poeticians� say about Eliade's fascism or
fascist connections, I would guess it's pretty much what they (or we)
would say about Pound's or any others' support of murder or mayhem.
About E�s writings otherwise, the Shamanism book was of particular use
to me when I was in need of something like that -- as a compilation, from
my perspective, of forms of language & experience that resembled in traditional
contexts what Rimbaud projected as the "absolutely modern."  And the term
"technicians of the sacred," which I came away with, gave me something
to think about -- alternately with fear & wonder.

Anyway, this to say I read you with interest in this strange medium.

With best,

Blink, Grandma, Please..."
By Andrew Lam, Pacific News Service

"Please, Grandma, blink, just blink, please," my mother says, but Grandma
only smiles. Then she says, "Bye, bye," her wheelchair gleaming in the
sunlight. "Bye, bye." It is all the English that she remembers.

"Alright, Grandma," I say, taking over, "if blinking's too hard, try to nod.
Nod, please, it's important. Very important."

We hold our breaths and wait. Nothing. No blink, no nod. Only that
constant beatific smile. My mother finally throws her hands up and sighs.
"This is it. We are doomed."

Grandma must learn to blink or nod her head at the right time. If she fails
to do so in front the officer from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, she may die.

I am not exaggerating. Without the much coveted U.S. citizenship, she'll
be cut off from the health care that had kept her alive for the last decade.

Blink, grandma, please.

The problem is that Grandma's once sharp mind has dwindled to that of
an infant, peppered with sporadic moments of lucidity. She's 87, diabetic
and severely senile. Since a stroke left her partially paralyzed several
years ago, she has resided in a convalescent home where attendants
regularly measure her blood and inject the insulin she needs.

As a legal immigrant who has lived here for more than two decades, she
is qualified for U.S. citizenship. In 1994 Congress passed a law that
exempted seriously disabled immigrants from English proficiency and
civics requirements. Then, last month, the INS issued new rules removing
that exemption. The INS says it will be flexible about ways that these
immigrants can take the oath. Blinking or nodding, they say, will suffice.

But what seems to the INS an easy, even a charitable solution is more
like cruel and unusual punishment to mentally handicapped immigrants.
How can a person suffering Alzheimer's disease nod at the right
moment? Can you teach a mentally retarded child to blink, pretending to
understand that he's taking an oath? And can people in comas or
completely gone into their own worlds possibly grasp that a single
gesture has such enormous significance.

The situation would be sardonically funny in a play or movie -- Samuel
Beckett, I should think, or perhaps Stanley Kubrick. But this is not
make-believe; this is the new American reality for hundreds of
thousands of immigrant families like mine.

Blink, grandma, please.

Of course, if Grandma is thrown out of the convalescent home she will
be far from a life on the street: we take care of our own. But how well?
And how long? My parents are not rich. They worked for decades to
achieve a modest middle class life, complete with a home in the suburbs.
But they are both in their late 60s and can't possibly perform
round-the-clock care - let alone medical duties.

It comes down to this: If Grandma fails to blink at the right time she will
not become an American citizen. Then the government may take away
her health care. If that happens, my parents may have to sell their home,
the sum of their labor, to pay for her medical treatment. Then after all the
money's gone, what?

Blink, grandma, please.

This woman, gray haired, smiling in the sunlight, survived two wars in
Vietnam. She had seen enough horrors to last ten lifetimes -- including
having her home bombed twice by American planes. She raised four
children on her own when her husband died at the age of 34 and, after
we fled to America 22 years ago, babysat her grandchildren, cooked
and cleaned.

In her mid seventies, she decided to go back to school to study English.
"Never give up," she often told her grandchildren, "when there is still
work you must finish it."

Her strong values passed down to three generations, all now
hard-working Americans. But in her twilight, my grandmother is faced
with something she can not possibly fight: The banal bureaucracy of the
U.S. government.

Blink, grandma, please.

Last year, some of my aunts and uncles voted for Proposition 187, the
"anti-illegal immigrant initiative," hoping to draw the line between legal and
illegal. But they soon discovered that line did not hold. It has becomes
clear to us all that the anti-immigrant purge makes no such distinctions
and is going after the weakest link -- the aged immigrants, those who
could not vote, or have no public voice. But will it stop there?

If we are ready to force retarded and senile immigrants to blink and nod
before we care for them, then we ourselves have already shut our
eyes. As anti-immigrant sentiment grows, we no longer recognize
ourselves as a nation of immigrants. When a society hides behind
bureaucracy to do its dirty work the only logical outcome is cruelty.

"OK, grandma, let's pretend I'm the American officer, " I say. "when I read
you the oath, you blink or nod, OK? Try it." But Grandma only smiles.
"Bye, bye," she says. She seems so small and frail and far away, fading
into nothingness under glaring  California sunlight. "Bye, bye."

Dear Kathy:

At the last minute here my lodging plans seem to be collapsing. I was going
to stay with friends in Philadelphia & commute by train. But now (I won't
go into all the reasons) that seems to be impossible.

Bob Perelman has offered me space in his hotel room, with Alan Golding,
pending Alan's assent. I'm willing to take a pallet on a floor, or even
just a floor if it comes to that. And of course I will contribute my share.
I have emailed Alan asking him. But I also thought I ought to email you in
case you have other ideas or suggestions, or perhaps know someone else who
has no roommate and wants one, or someone who has cancelled . . .

any help is very much appreciated, and I am sorry to be such a pain at this
late date when you must have much else to think about.

all best wishes, and I look forward to meeting you.

Dear Charles, I hope you find somewhere to stay at the Rutgers conference,

HERE WAS YOUR CHANCE TO SAY--"I would rather eat carpet tacks than share a
hotel room with Bob Perelman."

with Alan Golding,

HERE WAS YOUR CHANCE TO SAY, --"But Alan is so cheap he begrudges even the
price of an e-mail, and his prostate has become so enlarged I fear he will
step on me during one of his fifty trips to the bathroom during each long
New Jersey night."

Oops, I had better stop now, I'm getting into this too much, and speak as a
fond admirer of Alan, Bob and Charles,

Good luck everyone,

1) Has anyone of late thought to mention what a terrific series Sylvester
Pollet's Backwoods Broadsides is? If not, let me be the first. Real
chapbooks on a single sheet of paper (and without seeming crowded). Many are
by poets who are simultaneously widely published but genuinely
underappreciated (Enslin, Rochelle Owens, Bern Porter, Anne Tardos, Andrew
Schelling, Schwerner coming up soon).

2) Has anyone else noted the genuinely bad start with which the Cubs began
their year? I have a theory, called "The Curse of George Will." My evidence
is that the Cubs were unable to win until after the big Ginsberg memorial at
Temple Emmanuel in San Francisco was complete. The Cubs' minor league teams
also have the worst cumulative record in baseball. Jack Spicer would have
appreciated this form of torture.

There is an article in today's NY Times science section about biologists'
take on the concept of the self.  Unsurprisingly, they see it as a deep-
seated social survival mechanism (by deep-seated I mean back to the membrane
separating individual amoebae).  They also differentiate between cold-blooded
reptiles, which have a basically defensive, passive response to environment,
& mammals, whose warm-bloodedness allows for more initiative & creativity.

As far as humans go, they focus on the symbiosis of self & social environment;
the stronger the sense of individuality, the more complex & "successful" the
survival in the community.  There's more but I just skimmed it.

Remember Joe Poet, or was it Josephine?  The one who always pushed to the
front of the line at the open mike & read his poem about how he felt after
he stubbed his toe on a fire hydrant & what it meant for his neighborhood,
city, nation, cosmos?  Remember?  Remember?  God, his poems were lousy.

Mandelstam talks about poetry as a surging force, pre-existing.  & yet
particularly in his Voronezh poems (a new translation, _Voronezh Notebooks_
from Bloodaxe Bks, is out there.  Mandelstam is the greatest) the "lyric"
is personal, personal, wild, wild, personal, surviving voice, surviving
challenging & submitting to & condemning his coyote-enemy, Stalin.

I think the practice of any kind of work for
any length of time brings anonymity - the ego getting
caught up in the form of the work - but I think his denial of self here
is a little... uh.... oh shut up for a while, Henry [Blarnes here]...

Thanks, Ron. The two latest have just gone out, #26 A Real Toad, by
Jennifer Craig Pixley (the allusion to Marianne Moore recently discussed)
and #27 Between Ourselves, by Peter Money.
July will bring Zwyczaj/Mark Nowak, and Family Tree/Mary de Rachewiltz.
October, Armand Schwerner & Amiri Baraka. Anyone on the list can have a
free sample (they sell for a buck apiece ppd.) or subscribe for $10.

1.  Mark W. discussed individualism and the Western tradition.  My use
of the term is different than his:  I think of "individualism" in its
current manifestation, as emanating from certain strains of
Romanticism, the most obvious example of which is Coleridge's "Kubla
Khan."  I agree that individualism is not around, at least not in the
same form, in earlier periods.

2.  Henry--any ideology can be used to send people to death camps.  My
guess is that more people have been killed in the names of Karl Marx
and Jesus Christ than in the names of all the rest of humanity
combined.  Both were more interested in liberation than repression.
The tyrants grab hold of any ideology that will work and use it to
hurt.  Let's not fool ourselves:  ideas for tyrants are not as
important as they are for us thinking types.  For them, they are no
different than a brick, baton, bullet or bomb.

3.  I believe in improvisation, transfiguration, torquing, twisting,
and altering given social materials.  Some of the materials forge us --
the ones we forget -- and some we act upon. If you want to call this
work individualism, be my guest (as Conrad Hilton would say.)

4.  Funny to find myself here -- in graduate school my interest in
pragmatist philosophy, before the big resurgence  in John Dewey
studies, caused me to be called "naive" by Continental theory heads who
didn't think I was taking the "Death of the Author" far enough.

5.  Five years ago, Mark Wallace and I began a dialogue with the clause
"there is no such think as Language" as a way of critiquing the
totalizing and structuralist tendencies of much of Continental Theory.
We advocated the messiness of languages, plural, instead.

6.  Henry -- It follows from 5 that you're aiming at the wrong
"culprits."  Find the "real" ones.

7.  About babies and temperments -- of course there is something
natural here. I've been around too many to believe in tabula rasa.
Then again, it's a long walk from genetic predisposition to Romantic
Individualism.

8.  No hard feelings -- i luv it when the rhetoric heats up.  Let down
your hair and drop trousers, gang!


Best,

Jeff

P.S.  Neither Mark nor I intend on trying to send people to death camps
any time soon.  Nor do we plan on aiding any individual or regime who
does attempt to do so. In fact, our tendency would be to oppose such an
individual or regime.  I can only speak for myself on this one, but I
would do so by any means necessary.

This is a very important point.  But you have to be an individual to
stand up to them.

I agree with you guys there.  There is no such thing as language.  See my
400 pp. post on the Language Chat List for further extended commentary on
this position.

But it's an even longer stretch from Romantic Individualism to McDonald's
in Dinkytown.  And an even LONGER stretch from there to what you guys said:
"the individual does not exist."

MIME-Version: 1.0

Mark Weiss, Henry Gould and others:

        Thanks for your lively responses to my recent post. I'm sorry to
have to continue to argue with you here.

        Mark: Quite simply, to say that one is socially constructed says
nothing about one's ability to respond to social constructedness, and to
effect change. Rather, one might construct a social notion of that field
of activity reduced to the term "individual" as a SOCIAL site where
various kinds of social activities are focused and rearranged. As M. Magee
(do I have this name right?) points out, there is already a history of
literary discussion of this kind of social activity of the human. I would
suggest also the work of ERVING GOFFMAN, who in books like SOCIAL
INTERACTION and others works very particularly with the notion of what he
calls "face work," constructing in the process an idea of human identity
as a series of responsive gestures to social phenomena, gestures that can
include many types of resistance, rewriting, and possibility. But none of
these possibilities are EXTRA-SOCIAL; rather, Goffman's idea is that
"personality" (choose what word you will) is this SERIES OF PERFORMATIVE
SOCIAL CHOICES).

        Henry: I appreciate your appreciation of my "youthful
seriousness"--I'd thank you for your "adult seriousness" if I was sure
that you were any older than I am. Perhaps I should have been more
particular in my detailing of philsophical history; yes, it's true that
Greek philosphy does not create the modern notion of the individual. I
think it's more traditional to start with Descartes in this regard, moving
up through Kant, etc. But I'm not sure I want to go into details here.
Rather, it seems to me that in such phrases as "the divine analogy which
is the unity of the human race," and "individuality is the gist" and
"humanity is the living manifestation of the divine image" simply repeats
the western history of a coercive "center elsewhere" that posits its goal
of reducing all difference to the sameness of "individuality" in the name
of a divinity to which it claims access. I have no problems with
considering the possibilities in the sacred, per se: rather, I have
intense problems with the philosophy and cultural critique you launch in
the name of a divinity which you understand as "unity," but in which I see
no presence of any unity.

        As to whether one goes to news reports for the details of
scientific surveys (and indeed whether one goes to such surveys as the
authoritative source on what constitutes the life of the human (I do NOT
say individual), I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not those
sources are disinterested and trusthworthy, or biased by social factors.

        But again, thanks for your response on this; it's made clear to me
that our differences here are profound.

        My apologies for my inability, on this modem, to correct typos.

        Mark Wallace

henry, your last remarks about the individual struck me as perfectly
appropriate for earth day!... in any case, and not to sound at all aloof
here, i can't really see the controversy i've been reading re invidual VS.
social -- henry, jeff, mark, others -- to the extent that recourse to the
social, even in the hands of somebody like foucault, need not do away with
human agency... sure, agency would seem to take a beating, as it were, when
one considers any larger, group context, esp. in historical terms (whether
social or ecological)... of course there is a sense that one is already
written, even as one writes, owing largely to the social dimension of
language practices...

but, but the question of the individual is surely a matter of continual
negotiation, yes? (sorry for this word, btw, "negotiation"---it's a bit too
fashionable, too currency-driven perhaps, but i'll stick with it)... in
fact, one could say that the self, whatever it is or they are, is always in
the midst of processes of self-negotiation (by which i do mean to invoke
some cognitive processing too)... you get human agency, and the creative,
in the work of raymond williams, just as you get it in dewey... you get
individual agency in bateson, even as you get it in spivak...

what one does with one's sense of agency, or individuality, is another
matter... i suppose, setting aside empirical research, this is what most
interests me---what our obligations, responsibilities, possibilities are as
individual agencies (and as a species) who are so caught up in our various
social-ecological-cosmic (to be just a bit oracular here) settings... which
opens more to that other thread---"what is white?"---and could open into
another, more eco/onto-oriented thread too---what is human?... but you
really can't ask one question, i think, without reflecting on the other,
esp. when you consider that, in the u.s. not all that long ago, those who
were non-white were "officially" considered by many to be non or sub-human,
and surely not full-fledged "citizens"...

i mean, it's in bringing ourselves to ourselves, whatever we are and
whoever we think we are---as anything but a solipsistic gesture---that
things get complicated, no?...

anyway, happy earth day, folks, and a belated happy passover!...

best,

joe

I seem to have become a miner, like my grandfather.

A Jew in New York


Like everybody else, I wasn't a Jew
Until I came to New York. In Portland, OR,
The other day, a young Latina asked me
If I were Jewyorican. Papa and Bubby
Came from Ukraine, landed in Brooklyn,
Settled in Harlan, KY, and named my father
Benjamin Franklin. My mother, the offspring
Of a coalminer, married Ben, the only Jew
In town. He didn't last. Ma remarried.
In kindergarten, in Cincinnati, instead
Of moving to the afternoon session the second

Semester, I stayed in Morning and changed my name.
This is the year 5755. In Chinese it is Year
Of the Dog. I am 45 years old, and learned that
The time between Rosh Hashona and Yom Kippur
Are the Days of Awe. Moody and gray, with dashes
Of absolute clarity, I love these days. Cleansing
The summer's sweat from the streets of New York,
I always think of the Year beginning in September.
"That's when school starts." A holdover from Youth.
This year, 1994, for the first time I thought,
Hey, it's the real New Year, and I am a real Jew.
A real Jew, and a real coalminer's son, too.

for the past number of days. So if any of my messages have appeared
more than once, I do apologize--I haven't seen but one or two of my
own appear in the past week or so.

I'm going to unsub for a while and try to flounder through
until semester's and summer term's end, but I can be
reached (I hope!) backchannel. For what it's worth, the thing about
"feeling sorry for the class collaborationists" was just a silly
comment. I happen to have become in my mid-years that lowest form of
homo-politicus: an armchair social-democrat.

And by the way, David B and George B, I've given up on trying to
decode your postings--tantalizing clues, but I now understand that the
key is too buried and beyond my reach. You guys are just plain good.

Well, you can lump Descartes & Judeo-Christianity together if you want, but
it's pretty lumpy.  Descartes "think therefore I am" ego is a truncated
version of what I'm talking about.  What I'm talking about is not exactly
western: it's probably most directly & simply presented in Byzantine art:
humanity as the mirror-imago of spirit.  It's not an other-centered divinity:
it's many-in-one.  And it's not necessarily anthropomorphic in another (differe
nt) truncated sense.  The mirror-image acknowledges the imageless, the
unrepresentable, the-- "I am".

Pierre == Muriel Rukeyser's being celebrated here at Teachers & Writers on
May 8 (reservations required, call now). I'll ask Jan Heller-Levi, the
editor of the MR Reader and instigator behind the recent string of MR
reprints (I think), whether the book you mention is coming back.

        A last word on my earlier post: I had to run to class, and so
could not finish (or carefully edit) my remarks.

        "Individuality" is in no way the creation of something "divine,"
rather, individuality is a social concept with a specific history, usually
but not always the history of claiming "MAN" as the centralized authority
over all experience, however that "MAN" is related to the "divine"
(usually, in this history, the "divine" is what gave "man" his primacy).
This specific history of the individual is directly tied to the history of

Kent,

Glad to hear the notebooks are being published.  As for "nimble responses"
etc., I was recalling -- probably badly -- a sense in the Lingua Franca
article that you had been somewhat, well, cagey.  If they never contacted
you, or if I remembered wrongly, I apologize.  (On the other hand, I also
recall quite admiring the stance I perceived.)

Of course, the Sokal event is different.  But the evasion of responsibility
by the editors of Social Text is not, I think, any more obtuse than the
retraction of Yasusada by APR.  Yasusada is more than a trick, yes, and more
than Sokal.

Cheers,
David

        The history of the individual is directly tied to the history of
economic and racial exploitation that marks the history of capitalism;
"individuality" becomes the basis for a class of owners to manipulate
workers in the name of the "individual's" freedom to seize resources (a
process usually referred to as "the right to make a profit"). The
"individual" posits a notion of human beings as self-contained, discrete,
brought into existence by a divine declaration, and not responsible to
anyting beyond their own individuality.

        I see nothing in the process of creation that is "individual," if
one means by that self-contained, discrete, and in any sense absolute
rather than provisional. Creativity emerges in responsiveness, contact,
that place where the human mind finds itself not singular and individual
but IN RELATION TO THE WORLD.

        There are no individuals--I guess I'm going to have to say that
again.

Mark:

     "Capitalism" becomes the basis for a class of owners to manipulate
others, not "individuality".  Not only is the process of creation
individual, but so is the process of interpretation.  We have all looked
at a work of art, be it literary or otherwise, and formed our own
interpretation of that work.  However, the artists alone knows how
he/she intended for the work to be seen, because the artist, as an
individual, gave birth to the work.

certainly! the only reason i have cable tv is to watch the nba all year,
the playoffs in their entirety, the bulls in particular and any soccer i
can catch. yet missed what i heard was an excellent mexico/usa world cup
prelim match on sunday (busy coaching 4 on 4 soccer and emphasizing to the
kids the similarities with basketball). what i've seen of mexico makes me
think they're very good so the u.s. matching them 2-2 speaks well for the
u.s. the mexican team is fast and precise on offense. fun to watch.

as for basketball, the bulls are vulnerable without rodman and kukoc that
is for sure. what's bad for me is that those two are my favorites to watch,
kukoc on offense and rodman at both ends. and what of the lakers? eddie
jones is the bomb. he's like the mexican soccer team: fast, precise and fun
to watch. and if clyde, hakeem and sir charles are up for it they could
make a run.

"Individuals" are not to blame for the fact that corporations increase
their clout in the legal system through the mechanism of the
"corporate individual".  Nor in my view has socialism (based on the
concept that the individual is subservient to the whole) proved very
successful in practice.  I still think the good bishops were on the
right track in their documents on the US economy of 10 yrs ago -
accepting private ownership as fostering efficiency, responsibility,
and a buffer against the state; yet demystifying capitalism as the
best of all possible worlds.  They provided a pretty thorough critique
of capitalism & called for an ethos of stewardship & communal responsibility
based on democratic governance.  It's easy to scoff at them as establishment
ameliorators - but then, it's easy to scoff, period.  You try coming up
with a better plan.  & they did it all while honoring the idea of the
Person as the heart of the whole matter.
   This has nothing to do with my "metaphysical" bent on this subject;
I'm not a Catholic; I looked into this issue during my community organizing
days.      - Henry Gould

Ten years ago David Bromige was a guest at my home in Washington, D.C.
where he was giving a reading that week.  After he left, I found that he
had left behind a pair of black bikini briefs and a pair of glasses that
seemed to magnify things out of all proportion.  I had no way of knowing

I wish him well on steps five through twelve.

Why should a concept of the individual necessarily be the "creation of
something divine?"  Also, what is troubling about positing "'MAN' as the
centralized authority over all experience?" And why do the above
descriptions of the "individual" seem so flat, dissected, and clinical?
Why do you narrowly label the individual as something "self-contained,
discrete, and in any sense absolute rather than provisional?" And if
Capitalism still exists, how did the individual slip away, if the
individual, as you mention, is a construction by which Capital perpetuates
itself?  In such a society, it seems that the lyric voice of personal
suffering would offer a more valid proof of individual struggle in the face
of mounting opposition.  Personally, I think Capital needs the concepts of
the social in order to flatten the greater dimensions of the individual.
Social constructions erase deeper, more ancient impulses, wherever they
come from, in order to pacify the present capitalist structure.

I do not like using this kind of highfallutin, distant and conceptual
language.  But what you, Mark Wallace lack, as well as myself in this
instance, is personal testimony, concrete examples, a language dedicated,
like good poetry, to the contradictions and myriad pressures of experience.
Maybe there is a place in philosophy for this kind of language.  But I do
not understand the benefit, indeed the truth, in your statement, "there are
no individuals."

Maria, it's too damn long to type. Look in almost any anthology. In the
Norton third ed. Shorter it's on p. 590. The title is "Poetry," is that
what you're looking under? It's the last stanza you want. sp

one of the senses of expletive is "a word which is obscene or

but expletive also means a word that serves as a filler, something to

I think that subconsciously, my lifelong pal David Bromige really gets it.
That a gap between serious discussions here of cosmology and eidetics--and
little scabrous stories about our sexualized history---is just a gap in
perception. Words delight me, and so do sentences (and so do those little
gestures Rachel makes, but that is another question). So if ten slow words
oft creep in one dull line, then I dont care whether I am hearing the
dictates of the creator of the universe or the latest poem from Bukowski,
forget it. But if I hear something delightful, the caroming of a word off
someone's discarded comma, so that there is a discernible pinnng!, then I'm
yr man.

Victor Coleman has always been a big fan of NCAA basketball. He is a big
Syracuse fan, for some reason.

Some friends and I always have in January a cvommittment to writing down
our predictions of the final 4. My friends did terrible this year because
of the hype for Kansas and Cincinatti/ they didnt get any. I got 2 right:
Arizona and kentucky.

But really, I am an NBA fan, more properly a Cavs and Sonics fan.

But that Victor Coleman: he gets pictures of basketballs on the covers of
his books. He sleeps beside a basketball. Nice smell. "Wake up and smell
the basketball," as his ex-girlfreind painted in a painting I have.

As we all know, the color of horse manure depends on whether it's fresh or
well-aged.  Uncle George obviously prefers the well-aged variety, since fresh
horse apples are green, green, green.

Yeah, and I also remember his twin cousin Shirley (or was it Stanley), who
always read last at the open mike, who read the poem about stubbed toes on
fire hydrants and their meaning in the cosmos in a sort of shy,
half-terrified whisper.  They were also terrible.

Having been to scads of open mikes, of course most of 'em were terrible.
But every so often a poem or even a line would break through that was
wonderous.  And I'd always recommend reading at the front of the open mike:
that way there will still be folks around to hear your poem about the fire
hydrant and your lovely, hurt toes.

Well, not in this household, but back on the WC, San Diego way, Quincy
Troupe, son of a basketball player, player near-pro himself til is knee
quit on him, has had basketball themes run through his work all along.
In fact there's a concert at RPI in Troy (that's in Nueva York, not Asia
Minor) tomorrow (& that's a pitch to the crowd in the Albany area) by
composer & trombonist George Lewis with a new composition using one of
Quincy's poems, with electronic innerjections of lines by Jordan,
especially the one he used when he quit briefly (to try his hand at
baseball): "I can live without it."

By the way the Cubbies were good enough to win 2 over my Mets, lawdie
lawd, though just half an hour ago the latter finished an excellent game
beating the Reds 7 to 2. It's been 60 degrees all day long & it won't
freeze tonight, the Mets won one, its parse-over day & thus no teaching,
martini hour is fast approaching, the individual vs the social match is
a draw at half-time, I hope bromige will wear them funny shorts when he
comes through Albany in the fall,unless of course he'd had to hock them
to get bowering out of Canada -- what a sweet one it has been! -- Pierre

I would think that most Nortons have it. It is Moore's most often reprinted
poem. It's called "Poetry", and dates from 1921. the year before Eliot's
big news. Hmm.

Maria & fellow-Listers & -lubbers, there are 2 versions. One,, too long to
type, as sp says, the other, very short, 4 lines I think, all mm left of it
in one of the more drastic acts of revision by any poet. Those 4 lines I
have neither by heart nor bookshelf.

PS Katharine, interesting that an expletive can look like something deleted.
 (2) lubbers, as in "lubbers come back to me," "Lubber, when you're near
me," "When your lubber has gone", and on & on.

Aldon, i need those magnify-things-out-of-all-proportion spectacles back!
I'm looking for a silver lining. That other item was my swimsuit. Actually,
keep that. It wouldnt fit me any more. I've been eating tons of these great
new potato chips called Kettle, & they have magnified me out of all
proportion.

Mark Wallace, always interested in what you have to say. But puzzled,
today,to hear there's no such thing as an individual, so let me try to
match up what I think with that assertion. Para One (above) was written by
an individual, or by someone who has learned how to sound like an
individual. He learned that from the stuff all over the scatter we call
society. Much of that stuff was commonly available, some of it (family
ways) was not. But how he learned it, the way in which he picked it up, &
so, what he did with it . . . isnt that down to a genetic template as
individual as your fingerprints? Well yes it is and so I think, Mark cant
be meaning _that_, when he writes "individual". Your parents (or caregivers
during infancy) encourage/discourage the manifestations of this template,
thus shape it until it feels like "nature". As your life proceeds, this
shaping will largely determine what you cause to happen to you.

   But there is something there from the womb they have to work with, no?
"Individual" I recall in the Am. Heritage Dictionary as "undividable". Not
from soc'y, but from itself. You can sound like anyone, if you're a good
mimic, but who is that who is sounding like anyone? Why am I having such a
hard time grasping this, when it sounds so straightforward for you?

    If there is so individual, there is no sin.  Great!  But the categories
of sin precede capitalism. In fact capitalism requires some of those
preexisting categories of behavior--Greed and Avarice--for its continued
infliction of itself upon us poor suffering mortals; mortals, we all die
but each faces his death as an individual, alone.

While the organizers of the conference on "The Making and Unmaking of
Whiteness" at UC Berkeley did not bother to send any notices of the affair
to my CSU campus, notice was posted in enough places that the media and
certain professional opponents of "social construction" "ism" got wind of
it in advance.  The day before the conference began, the San Jose Mercury
News ran a piece titled "Furor Erupts over Cal scholar's conference on
'whiteness'."  While I appreciated the use of quotation marks in the head,
I was confused by the same head's suggestion that only one Cal scholar was
in possession of the conference.  In the Mercury News article, "race
scholar" Shelby Steele was quoted as asking, from his perch in the Hoover
Tower at Stanford, "What else is ethnic studies going to do to justify
their existence? They've not produced anything in a critical way, just
celebratory.  It opens the door to this kind of garbage."  "Race scholar"
Shelby Steele is apparantly unaware that back in the days when Charles
Olson worked for the ethnic interests section of the Democratic Party,
"ethnic Studies," where it existed at all, was given almost exclusively to
the study of people who would today be termed "white."  I'm not really
clear how the putatively celebratory nature of ethnic studies is supposed
to have opened the door to the garbage of studying the construction of
whiteness either, but then I'm still a bit dim from all this reading and
teaching I have to do every day.   The same article quoted KLLC disc
jockey "Vinnie" as remarking, "When I see another white person walking
down the street, I don't say, 'Hey, that person's on my team,'" and I
suspect he was telling the truth.

Anyway, that will give you a sense of the social representation of the
conference on the social representation of whiteness.  The media were on
hand in impressive numbers as the conferenc opened, talked to one another
loudly through the early presentations, collared a few organizers for
sound bites and then had the good grace to leave.

The conference was opened by Elaine Kim, Michael Omi and Jose David
Saldivar, who remarked on the fact that a trio of "non-whites" (a term
that was denounced every three hours by members of the audience) was
introducing a conference studying whiteness.

The first negative reaction I had to the conference program came when I
realized that there would be no discussion of poetry anywhere in the three
days of the proceedings.  Then I recognized just how marginalized
literature in general would be at the conference.  It seemed that much of
the productive debate about racial discourse in writing had simply not
been read by those organizing the meetings.  An oddity in my eyes -- in a
nation that has often defined literature as a category not available to
"non-whites" (see T. Jefferson on that), here it seemed that white people
had little to do with writing at all!

The first panel, on popular culture, had some interesting work.  My sense
was that the grad. students on the panel had the most exciting material in
hand.  Josh Kun's paper, titled "The Yiddish Are Coming! Mickey Katz and
American Whiteness," was great stuff -- and he played some fine Klezmer to
an audience who mostly hadn't heard it before.  (and if you've never heard
Katz sing "Don't Let the Schmaltz Get in Your Eyes" you ain't heard
nothing yet!)  Annalee Newitz was quite good on "The Whiteness of the
Police."  Eric Lott and Fred Pfeil gave pretty good talks, but they were
for the most part elaborations of work that they have produced previously.

The audience responses to the first panel set the tone for the remainder
of the week-end.  There were several quite good questions and observations
from people who had obviously listened carefully and thoughtfully,
interspersed among the diatribes from those who thought either that the
whole conference was just one more way for white elitists to control
discussion (despite the evident integration of the entire conference), and
those who believe that the mere existence of academic conferences is just
one more means by which the oppressive bourgeois apparatus prevents true
revolutionary action from taking place.

Panel Two included rather bland presentations of interview work done by
Michelle Fine and Lois Wise, and more intriguing talks by Cameron McCarthy
(on "suburban resentment and the representation of the inner-city in film
and television") and Aida Hurtado on "taming (becoming) the savage: white
ethnic appropriation in the construction of whiteness" [what I sometimes
term the "Pocahontas Perplex"].

The last panel of the first day included both the worst of times and the
best of times.  Cheryl Harris, whose "Whiteness as Property" is a
touchstone of Critical Legal and Race Theory work, gave an exemplary (and
very literary I might add) reading of legal rhetoric in court decisions
regarding race.  Walter Benn Michaels, on the other hand, delivered
himself of exactly the sort of procrustean redefinitions and misreadings
that mar his recent book _Our America_.  According to Michaels, race
cannot be a social construction because it is a mistake.  (One wonders why
it cannot be both.  One wonders why those who have made this mistake don't
apologize [though I resist the apologia mode in these discussions as it
plays right into the media's ((as in the Mercury news the day before))
tendency to portray any discussion of the subject of racism as "white
apology.")   The continuing problem in Michaels's work on this subject is
his tendency always to reduce race to something that somehow inheres in
the individual (despite his frequent disclaimers that he is not proposing
an individualist perspective); as several of his fellow panelists tried to
point out to him, the idea that race is relational _means_ that it
persists in the language beyond the body of the individual.

I will now hurry things along a bit, as some of you are in digest mode and
paging rapidly to the next post.

On Saturday Howard Winant gave a rambling talk that pretty much replayed
the work he's done with Omi. Ruth Frankenburg talked about locating
research on whiteness, Caren Kaplan gave a very incisive talk on commodity
feminsim in an era of globalization, and Nancy Scheper-Hughes went on
interminably about her field work in South Africa.  (An instance of an
interesting subject made boring by the mode of presentation.)

The second panel of the second day was titled "Queering Whiteness,
Querying the Self."  Allan Berube talked about "How Gay Stays White,"
perhaps the most "confessional" of the papers presented at the conference.
Jasbit Puar demonstrated once more that the grad. students were doing some
of the best work in these areas, Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarno recited a sequence
of nostrums, and John Powell of Minnesota led the crowd through a careful,
but informal exploration of "The Fluidity of Self and the Stability of
Race," the highlight, for me at least, of that panel.

The last panel I was able to attend was titled "Critical Studies of
Whiteness."  Noel Ignatiev was unable to present his paper, so a Berkeley
staff member read if in his place.  It wasn't so much a critical study as
it was a restatement of the _Race Traitor_ platform.  I have a general
sympathy with Ignatiev, but I doubt that reifying blackness is a good way
to unmake whiteness.  The term "New Abolitionists" has its merits, until
you recollect some of the peculiar racial ideas of some among the old
abolitionists (remember Garrison and others telling Douglass he should
just tell his story and leave the theory to them!)  And I'm not at all
sure it's true that racism is the major prop of capitalism in the United
States, though it's one hell of an accomplice -- Other papers wrapping up
the day included Mab Segrest's autobiographical "memoirs of a race
traitor" talk on "The Souls of White Folk" and David Wellman's "Whiteness
as a Site of Contestation."  David Roediger, again from Minnesota (and
just why are there so many experts on whiteness from Minnesota?), gave a
much-needed reminder in the form of his paper "Studying Whiteness: An
African-American tradition," in which he quickly sketched some of the more
important stages in the development of "whiteness" studies by black
authors, including most prominently the Du Bois of "The Souls of White
Folk."  Michael Rogin was amusing in the role of absent-minded professor
as he commented on the papers and fielded questions from the audience.

Which included a not-entirely unexpexted disruption.  A fellow who
announced that he called himself Thorsson ("I reject my Christian name")
interrupted Mab Segrest to denounce the entire proceedings as an affront
to Euro-Americans.  Turned out he was there in cooperation with Dale
Warner, a fellow who represents himself as head of a European American
activist organization.  I'd had prior experience of Mr. Warner.  After a
talk I gave in San Jose, he sent letters to senior faculty at my
university (I was not yet tenured), on the letterhead of his law firm,
denouncing me as among the 15% [where DOES he get these numbers] of
European Americans who are "deeply twisted, pathologically self-loathing,"
and therefore unfit to teach at a university.  This in response to my
public invitation to white Americans to work with white Americans to end
racism.  [This was echoed in the Mercury News article, by the way, when
radio talk-show host Michael Savage said of the conference organizers:
"They're self-hating fools.  They'll be happy when whites are on the
cotton plantation."  I'm not making this up, guys -- guess he didn't know
white people had always been on the cotton plantation.]

Sunday morning featured a session on the "Histories of Whiteness," which I
had to miss -- Troy Duster made closing remarks, and then, despite the
closing remarks having already been made over lunch, there was scheduled
an open discussion titled: "The Unmaking of Whiteness: Where Do We Go from
Here?"  I was intrigued by the first person plural of that, assuming it
meant "we" who might want to unmake whiteness, but I was even more
intrigued wondering just where the "here" is in that question.  But I was
already flying to L.A. by then, and will have to wait for others to tell
me what happened.

tune in next time for "On the Wings of Atalanta," or "College Language
Association Meets the Black College Spring Break Freaknik," and will
somebodies after Rutgers please tell us absolutely everything?

i dont feel attacked.  really.  i hoped to say to dale that referring to
my posts as "intellectualized" was an out of hand dismissal.

i was/am in complete agreement that there are material/experiental effects of
race.  this was the thrust of my last post where i agreed with dales
comments on this matter (and bodies which).

i dont quite understand why if what im saying does not resemble what other
"white" theorists do--not taking responsibility for privilege--my
comments are lacking some essential dimension of that discourse.  should
i be saying it like them? perhaps i might learn something from them but....

i think its important to remember that i objected to how easily ginsberg
was collapsed into a category of "white guys"--and that i intended to
reflect  upon the difficulty of using that denomination to identify him.
i dont think thats such a difficult position to accede to.

thanks for your post maria.

with "resonance" i wanted to suggest that it carries a rather negative
connotations.  i dont want to sound like dinesh d'sousa here but "white"
is often used as a derogatory appellation.  no i do not believe in
"reverse" discrimination.  im not one of "those."  really.

it: white.  it should be used in brackets i think or under erasure--its

i wont deny your experience and i think that your comments here suggest
my own need to re-think my own responses in relation to what you have to say
about this.  im not trying to own them to my self but say that i think i
have something to learn from what you have to say here.

id like to think that "white" is something that stands between us
perhaps.  i as much as you perhaps would like not to have to negotiate
its effects and shapes in our lives.  i am very uncomfortable with it at
times--as much as it creates privileges for me.  living in nw washington dc
off and on i recognize the geographic determinations of race but though i
found it comfortable to live in a "white" area of the city (i later moved
to se capitol hill where there is a greater mix of people) i was also
greatly disturbed by the wealth and extravagance and often blatant
excessive grossness of money.  if "white" is that sort of privilege (and
more) i would rather not be included.  you know?

id like to hear more from you on this actually.  im not sure i
understand.  my first response is that its would seem to me that i should
wield that privilege and wield it responsibily (and i hope i have).  race
is not a concept: ok.  i understand it is a lived experience.  at the
same time i believe that words like white hispanic asian indian do not do
justice to the "daily experiences" you refer to.  you said you are
uncomfortable with "white" assumptions about your race and its implications:
such assumptions (on the part of whites) are the effect of the limited
semantic/linguistic tools we--?!--have for talking about cultural differences.

i hope i was clear about this last point: i just think a better language
could be used/developed for talking about race than the generalizations
of categories we use to do so.

sorry to take up so much space.

if i hazard a reckless summary bear with me: but the vaguely humanist
yearnings in some postings on this thread and the post-humanist critiques
of the former lead me to wonder if there is not a need (being filled?)
for a post-humanist humanism.  if so what name does it go by?  what i
mean is that there seems to be this rather humanist nostalgia for some
sort of meaning and significance defined by a universalist
particularization of the individual that competes with a
post-structuralist decentering of the individual.  in this discursive
encounter i wonder if there is a way of reconciling these discourses.  i
believe charles altieri takes on this issue somewhere--is someone up on
his stuff?

Poet Demands State Senate Pay Rent for Poem

For Immediate Release:
April 23, 1997
For additional information contact:
Brendan Lorber
212/533-9317
lungfull@interport.net


Poet and publisher Brendan Lorber is adding his voice to the protest
against the end of rent regulations in New York.  This Wednesday he will
send a poem to every state senator on behalf of the millions of tenants who
will be forced from  their homes if regulations are terminated.  But he
isn't just giving the legislators a piece of his mind -- he's renting it to
them.

"Poem for Rent" is a 12-page page booklet with drawings by Lorber
throughout.  The back cover explains, "This spacious well-lit poem with
western exposure and plenty of closet space is the property of Brendan
Lorber.  It is being rented to you." Underneath is a request that the
senators remit payment according to one of three rental plans.  If they are
in favor of rent control, the book is theirs for 15 cents a month. If they
prefer rent-stabilization it's an affordable 25 cents.  If they are against
all regulations the book is $1,500 a month.  "The senators should pay
whatever they think is right," Lorber said. "If a majority opposes
regulations, the senate will owe me about $45,000 by the first of May."

Asked if he thought the state legislature would actually pay their rent, he
said, "Well I hope the senators don't turn out to be a gang of squatters."


"Poem for Rent" is an ironic poem that challenges the senate to consider
the effect of its actions.  With a refrain of "Cast your ballots," Lorber
unfolds a litany of injuries New York City will suffer if regulations
expire:  from increased homelessness to the exodus of the city's working &
middle class.  Even parking will become more difficult, with families
living in their cars.  Both landlords and tenant groups agree that rents
will skyrocket with deregulation.  The only thing standing between hundreds
of thousands of New Yorkers and the street is the state legislature.  And
"Poem for Rent" is an indication that New Yorkers won't stand by silently
while their representatives fail to represent them.  In the poem, Lorber
writes, "Who'll live here after I'm cast / from my one-bedroom with brick
wall view? / Maybe Governor Pataki after he's voted from office."
Discussing the situation, he added, "What makes New York unique is the
diversity of its residents.  Once we're forced out, what's left?"

"Unless we all act now, tourguides of the future will say, 'Welcome to New
York City, the only city in America populated solely by millionaires and
homeless people.  To the north is Harlem, a vibrant center of the
African-American community before the African-Americans were forced out.
To the south is the Village, home to thousands of the country's most
talented writers and artists before they too were forced out.  Across the
East River is Brooklyn, called the City of Churches before all the
parishioners were evicted.  And here is Central Park, the emerald prize of
the city before it became the world's largest shantytown.'"

Brendan Lorber, 27, is a New York native, raised in Greenwich Village.  His
work has appeared in the Village Voice and the Chicago Tribune as well as
numerous other publications.  He is also the publisher and editor of
LUNGFULL!Magazine, a national literary journal that supports emerging and
established writers.  He has performed his work throughout the country and
in Australia and has made numerous radio and television appearances.

Hm. I sometimes feel like I wasn't as much a Jew until I moved *out* of
New York, to a place where being Jewish was something distinctive that
had to be explained to people. I only started to really grok Jewishness
when I had something to contrast it too.

I'm looking forward to your performance at the Knitting Factory Seder

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

For anybody interested in looking at the relation between individuality
and capitalism Max Weber's THE PROTESTANT WORK ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF
CAPITALISM traces this relation, and his other work follows through on
many of the implications of that book.

        For Weber, the work ethic begins in a communal process of
self-denial, opposed to individualism, that allows the group to build
business and capitalist power through a devotion to continued profits at
the expense of self-gratification. In later phases of this development,
the increasing profits of the capitalist economy erode the original
communal base, fostering the idea of individual success at the expense of
the group--and thus, in the long run, destroying its own power system. In
this reading, then, capitalism creates individualism, while at the same
time individualism creates a new form of capitalism, one based on
indulgence of the self at the expense even of the power of the business--a
capitalist ethic that, in this country, finally became utterly dominant in
the era of leveraged buyouts and corporate raiders, who often found that
they could make more individual profits by DESTROYING businesses that were
making too much money.

        Certain of Weber's takes on particular matters have been shown to
be false; nonetheless, I've seen no successful rejection of its basic
thesis. Cornell West, for one, continues to look to Weber's work as one of
the main bases of his own thinking about capitalism.

Dear David, Herb (being a man of some refinement) never enters these
sordid revels--probably still disgusted at being assigned fictional
custody of a certain "object" during the Bowering wars of last summer.

Speaking of objects, underwear, and the man, are you sure you mean
Everlast and not EverReady?

Huh?

But David, I don't think I've ever seen any Canadian underwear. (Robert
Mittenthal has, on occasion, mentioned a pair of dainty hand-washables that
was left in his spare room by some visiting, uh, dignitary in the early
Subtext@Speakeasy days.  But despite Robert's offers/threats, I've never
set eyes on this particular artifact.)

Oh, wait, come to think of it, I'm actually wearing Canadian underwear
right now, as I type this.

If, that is, the t-shirt of BlaserCon '94 counts as such.

Dear Poetics Folk:

Chax Press now has a web site which can be found at

http://personal.riverusers.com/~chax/

It's brand new. Most of the kinks have been worked out, but on 3 of the 9
pages there are several images which take some time to download --
hopefully not enough time to go & get a cup of coffee.

Anyone (Loss, Chris Alexander, Pierre, others?) who wants to make a link,
please do. I've linked to some of you, but am open to other suggestions as
well.

The first 10 people ordering books from the web site, via email, will be
given a 50% discount on orders. Prices are on the site. I'll let you know
whether or not you were among the first ten.

Also announcing:

a new book:

The Tongue Moves Talk
by Karen Mac Cormack
$11 plus $2 shipping & handling

But all ordering from Poetics before May 10 may have this book for $9,
including shipping & handling.
More details about the book are on the web site.

And please email responses to this offer directly to me at chax@theriver.com

From now until the middle of next week I have my poetics set on nomail.

I had hoped to leave this discussion to Henry the Brown, who has been doing
just fine, but I guess I'll have to wade in.
This question is a set of chinese boxes. No "proof" is possible, because we
all, and all the phenonmena we muster to one side or the other, could be
merely ideas in the mind of god. For the sake of argument, I put aside such
conversation-stoppers.
Where to begin? Personality and individuality are not interchangeable terms.
However generated, personality is socially perceived, individuality is
individually perceived. We write critiques of romantic individualism, not
romantic personalitism. If Goffman mixes these two terms up, throw the book out.
Personality, how one presents oneself and is perceived, is certainly partly
a social construct, and varies according to social situation: I'm a
different person with different people. But it's not entirely, nor even
overwhelmingly, a social construct. Chemistry and genetics also count.
Personality, as anyone who has ever experienced a chemical alteration to the
brain, self-induced or otherwise, knows, is a most fragile thing: the
peaceable can become violent, the shy demonstrative, etc. "You're a
different person when you're (fill in condition or substance)," those who
observe us most consistently and intimately will say.
Chemical balances change constantly. Sometimes a spike in a given substance
in the brain will lead to surprising behavior that may be considered
inappropriate in a given social context: we run off with the neighbor's dog.
When the chemistry returns to baseline we consider more objectively our
relationship with said beast.
There are, of course, social/cultural determinants to how we express these
changes. In a dogless context we run off with the cat.
As for genetics, we all know of children who, despite being raised in what
would appear to be the same environment, behave, from the womb, quite
differently. But it's fair to argue that no two children are really raised
in the same environment--differences of nurture, no matter how small, could
explain differences of personality, no matter how large. That's why twin
studies have been so valuable. Studies of identical twins raised apart from
birth have been going on, in this country and Japan (where, traditionally,
twins were separated at birth and raised apart), since the twenties.
Consistently, the twins studied show remarkable similarities of personality,
down to such seemingly inconsequential matters as color preferences. In more
serious matters, like the incidence of schizophrenia, the findings have been
striking: if one twin is schizophrenic, there is a 50% likelihood that the
other will be, regardless of who raises each child. In fraternal twins the
likelihood is the same as in the general population. This finding has been
the impetus for all of the exciting work being done to try to identify the
genetic mechanisms that predispose to schizophrenia.
Individualism is a separate subject. Baseline--altho our personalities may
change, altho the social value placed on the concept of the individual and
the role that the individual plays within a society may change, all humans
in all cultures who are not afflicted with certain severe and quite specific
brain dysfunctions experience themselves as individuals--possessed of a
continuing internal narrative that is different from the narrative of the
next guy over. A major concern of the narrative is the constant negotiation
and renegotiation of relationships with the world outside the
individual--the establishment of boundaries and the terms for cooperation,
and a critique of the social determinants of one's conceptualization of
self. Most of us have a series of different identities--as individual,
family member, community member, citizen, etc. The emphasis on one or the
other identity is usually functional, or a remnant of when it was
functional. Depending upon the social context, social cohesion or individual
freedom of action may be more valued in a given culture at a given moment.
Cooperation is stressed and idealized when a high degree of cooperation is
necessary for survival, individual freedom may be stressed when times are
more flush. And individuality may be idealized as a protest against the
limitations imposed by functionally obsolete social restrictions (caste,
class and the like).
Neither individualism nor romantic individualism begin with the romantics,
although they certainly are good examples of my last point. I think one can
find literary traces of both going back to the greeks, and as a social
reality it probably goes back to the beginning of the evolution of
consciousness. Heroic oral narratives by and about living individuals exist
in almost all non-literate cultures. But I'll stick with recent western
culture. Living at a time when existing sociopolitical structures were less
and less functional, any good 16th century calvinist accepted both that his
own good or bad fortune indicated something about him as an individual and
that it was dependent upon a destiny which he could not alter. Whether or
not he prayed in the company of others, his primary relationship to god was
one to one. A century later, after the English civil war, Dryden has the
hero Almanzor (in The Conquest of Granada) echo Milton's Satan when he
declares that "I alone am king of me." Satan, who remains rebellious, is
demonstrably wrong (look what happens to him). Almanzor, after doing no end
of damage to the society in which he lives, submits his individual will to
the power of the state (across the water Le Cid did the same), reflecting,
in the wake of the civil war, the danger to society posed by heroic
individualism, as Dryden and many others saw it. At issue is the balance
between the needs and rights of the individual and the needs and rights of
the society.
In current American society, many of us, myself included, react to what we
perceive as the ideological abandonment of cooperation and the overemphasis
on unbridled individualism (Donald Trump: "I alone am king of me") that
makes concerted action almost impossible by emphasizing the social over the
individual. But to parse individual motivations so fine as to see nothing
but social determination seems to me to partake more of theology than social
theory. Any objection on behalf of individuality can be countered by one on
behalf of social determinism, usw, and we're left deciding who comes up with
the last turtle.
Enough. New fields and pastures new.

Poetry

I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all
                 this fiddle.
   Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one
                discovers in
   it after all, a place for the genuine.
       Hands that can grasp, eyes
       that can dilate, hair that can rise
             if it must, these things are important not because a

high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because
                  they are
       useful. When they become so derivative as to become
                     unintelligible,
       the same thing may be said for all of us, that we
           do not admire what
           we cannot understand: the bat
               holding upside down or in quest of something to

eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf
                 under
        a tree, the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse
                     that feels a flea, the base-
        ball fan, the statistician-
            nor is it valid
                 to discriminate against 'business documents and

school-books'; all these phnomena are important. One must
                 make a distinction
    however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the
                 result is not poetry,
    nor till the poets among us can be
         'literalists of
         the imagination' - above
             insolence and triviality and can present

for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall
                  we have
    it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand,
    the raw material of poetry in
        all its rawness and
        that which is on the other hand
            genuine, then you are interested in poetry.

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and
also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to continual
redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized
discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations,
and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. Joel Kuszai is list manager.  For subscription information
contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot always decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."


set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail
message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

 or

 review POETICS by name

(which will give you the list alphabetically by name)

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.

Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Sylvester Pollet & List--

        Let me add my voice in praise of Backwoods Broadsides--I have been
grossly neglecting a variety of correspondences & near the top of this list
for months has been a thank you to SP for his carefully edited & beautifully
presented series. The latest two ("A Real Toad" & "Between Ourselves")
arrived last week & are as absorbing as the back issues I selected before.
The length of the broadsides is fascinating: Peter Money's has as many poems
as a short chap book, while Anne Tardos presents a group of drawings which,
unfolded, might be one image: so SP has taken two pieces of paper & turned
one into a drawing you could hang on your wall and the other into a book
you'd keep in your shelf--
        I explain it poorly but order them and see for yourself!

Is this true? (not the stuff about the themes, etc). I know that Quincy
Troupe's father, Quincy Trouppe, played in the Negro leagues from 1930
until their demise (for the KC Monarchs, Homestead Greys, the Chicago
American Giants, and others), and then briefly in the majors. This wouldn't
leave much time to play basketball seriously. But then again, in those days
you didn't get rich playing baseball, esp. in the Negro Leagues, so I can
see where he would have had to barnstorm at hoops too, to make a living.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Good for Brendan Lorber!
& May what happened in Massachusetts, not come to pass in New York.

Since rent control was banned in Massachusetts, former rent control tenants
(aka "protected status") have faced rent increases anywhere from 50-300%.
What have cities done to help all the people who are now vulnerable to
"market rates?" Nuttin. Except, in Cambridge at least, the city has set up
a board to "assist" people in moving out of their apartments and, since all
the rents in the city have skyrocketed, effectively move out of the city.
Left on their own, city government does this kind of thing, and then they
praise themselves for it in the press.

There are alternatives though (for anyone in NY, or anywhere else facing
this situation).

Last week, after months of campaigning, tenant organizing, lobbying, etc.,
a group called the Eviction Free Zone saw through city council orders in
Cambridge that 1) transferred over 1 and 1/2 million dollars into the
Affordable Housing Fund (from the "free cash" coffer) and 2) designed a
transfer tax on residential sales in Cambridge--with the first $300,000
exempted that will provide a substantial revenue for replenishing
affordable housing funds.  This is going to the State House in a week or
so, where Governor Weld has already stated that he will veto ANY taxation
bill that does not have a local referendum attached to it. So in the
drafting of the bill, the EFZ insisted that such a referendum be attached.
We are very confident of being able to see that it passes in the fall.
Next on the agenda is securing a 20 million dollar bond for the immediate
purchase of apartment buildings on the market to be made permanently
affordable housing.

It's incredible the arguments that were made against all of our efforts.  I
am growing confident that the real estate interest is second in power in
this country only to the military/defense interest.  One argument: "if we
put through this transfer tax it will hinder young and struggling families
from buying homes in Cambridge."  A glance at the Sunday house
advertisements indicate the median price range for a house in this city to
be well beyond the means of any "young and struggling families." In fact, I
have come across more than enough families who have lived in Cambridge all
their lives and who cannot afford it anymore.  Their children will have to
settle elsewhere.

Anyway, it's been a long road, and it's certainly far from over. Hours of
meetings and talk complicated by time given for both Creole and Hispanic
translators, etc. But it can be done, and good luck to anyone facing this
dismal prospect.  Back channel me if you want more info. on the work we've
done here.

Brenda,

How can I get a copy of Lorber's poem?

Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday (April 12th-15th) constituted a grand
slam of poetry to rival January's Triple Crown.

Saturday in Golden Gate Park was the 2nd Antenym contributors' reading.
Although the weather was a mite cloudier than the previous Saturday, it was
fairly warm and there were plenty of critters about to punctuate the
readings, including a beautiful orange feral cat (recently feral,
apparently:  still had a collar) and an insistent quail.

Douglas Powell went first, reading several witty and smart poems from which
I'd like to quote, but someone had borrowed my pen, so the only one I can
regale you with is the one he spun off of Ginsburg, which went something
like this:

the mind is a shapely genital, and a face is a fig leaf.

Then recent S.F. transplant Rob Hale, who had several family members in
attendance, got up in a sharp suit and read from a series which has several
pieces in _Antenym_ 12:

these days have been mauve--but that doesn't sound possible
the mesh of so many laws allows the big fish to go free
in a small room, a large heart enclosed in a body
my country is a model of water purification
in the heart, there is another heart, clean as the sea.  But the sea isn't
clean.
the mirror doubles as a bee's nest
the irony, or whatever

Finally we got to hear what George Albon's been writing lately.  But first
he read a bit from Osip Mandelstam:

continent lifting itself on paws out of the sea.

George read from _Rehabilitation_:

what is hound?
terratoma, brain-compass
what is map?
slice sphere involving compromise
pirates in the green space making [...]
wrestlers fall, fall, fall
with each thud a portion of the metaphysic escapes
the first day of more day

Chris Daniels, Darin DeStefano, Eric Selland (I think), my sister, my
cousin, my nephew were among those spotted in the audience, and after the
reading my relatives and I went to a cafe and then to Mission Street to
have burritos and visit the new head shop on 24th St.  (man they want a lot
of money for those lava lamps)

On Sunday at the 3300 Club there was a reading for John High's new book
_The Sasha Poems_ featuring John and Harry Polkinhorn.  Four people signed
up for the open mic which was intended to follow (actually five, but one
got cold feet or something and didn't answer when called), but it was
decided to have two of us warm up instead.  Jack and Adelle Foley went
first, reprising the work (reassembled from Ginsburg lines about death)
that got them on the front page of the _Examiner_.  Then I read a couple
short poems, one from the new _Antenym_ and the other from my notebook
(turns out it's still in need of some punctuation).

John was ready by then, and read several of the Sasha Poems, begun both as
a way of dealing with despair and a way of communicating with his young
daughter.  Some lines I particularly liked were:

she healed herself and even the dead one found it pleasing
the chanting, like smoke, lifting from the Siberian snow
the moon so blue, chilled
there are those who listen to this music, and those who color its sound
all these abandoned shoes, walking about the windmills to the south
a winged butterfly moving toward the predawn face
what happened to the father that he is distracted by the voice of God?

There was a short break that allowed the assembled to mingle and order more
drinks.  (The assembled being, among others, Thoreau Lovell, Michelle
Murphy, Andrew Joron, Don Hilla, Jandy Nelson, Jonathan Hayes, Joseph
Aukee, Laurie Amat, Norman Fischer, and Anne (Andrew, was that Anne Lamott
or another Anne?).  I happened to mention to John that I had just turned
30, and Jandy said I must be having my Saturn return (right she was!)

Back to the reading.  Harry Polkinhorn, up from San Diego, read from three
works, "Stein", _Mount Soledad_, and _Throat Shadows_, which contained
lines such as the following:

an ambiguous power over the falconry of desire
egregious positing of [sorry, didn't get the word here] looks-at-you
your body exploded in its own manner of speaking
sucking the circular brilliance of the upper world into my own eyes
a present person does not mirror an absent one

Jonathan Hayes and one other open-mic reader later, we were deep into the
lasagna some wonderful person had made (was it proprietor Nancy Keane, as I
assume?) and conversation.  Jandy and I took the astrology route (though I
won't bore anyone else with the details, except to say that Jandy's a
Sagittarius with Pisces rising).

Cut to Monday night at Canessa Park, where series curator read with Ron
Silliman.  Good crowd for a Monday night, including Brian Lucas, Norman
Fischer, Eric Selland and Naoko, Colleen Lookingbill, Steve Tills, Spencer
Selby, Kevin Killian, Norma Cole, Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson, Leslie
Scalapino, Paul Hoover, Maxine Chernoff and Steve Vincent.

Avery read two translations of Salvatore Quasimodo that appear in _lyric&_
#5, and from his manuscripts _Differing Senses of Motion_ and _The City
Speaks in Many Tongues_.

the lizard in dormant awe
my scar-filled bean
trees running into each other at 70 miles per hour
starry richness of night?!
this rain is a sign of rain
"things are in the saddle and ride mankind"--Ralph Waldo Emerson
blinded by the not quite sunset
source as silence
cotton is king again

Ron, introduced as still probably the most effective anthologizer (I'm
paraphrasing) of "the Formerly Known as Language Poets", then read from
_Ketjak II_, which he said he's been working on since 1988 or -9:

memories of underdevelopment
for each and every sentence, an equal and opposite sentence
the odor from the cud of their great truck
definition itself is a form of Manhattan
the whale that ate Liberty Valance
brushing dead leaves off of dry poets
Antarctica has no legal time
Vanpools of the night, unite!
is seriousness boredom come of age?

Then on the 15th at New College, Eileen Myles read to a packed house in the
Cultural Center.  Lyn Hejinian, Gloria Frym, Jean Day, Michael Price,
Shauna Hannibal, Kevin Killian, Dodie Bellamy, Giovanni Singleton, Bob
Gluck and Alison were in the house as Eileen rolled poems off her tongue in
a thick New York accent:

even the millennium is unspeakably long
I'm beginning to trample you all with my big ass daily
it's the openness of summer that disturbs me
there may come a day when my dog will eat cat food
the blood in the eyes of the cars
under the spotlight--eep!
he's like a big posing gondola
we must offer ourselves up as food or eat someone
not a poet, but a donut or a myth
prose fills the window and becomes abstract
now that we're through virtual reality, we can try virtue, that might work
the word wiggly describes my desire
I believe in you like a door that returns

and a poem that Eileen was pleased to report she heard through the lesbian
grapevine that Adrienne Rich had giggled at, which reads in its entirety
(of course I'm omitting any line breaks that may exist in the original):

Her tongue and her heart were throbbing in the holster of her pussy.

Coming soon:  my report on some more S.F. readings....

Actually, this became quite an issue between Uncle George & me.  He claimed
poetic license based on an obscure tradition from Taigetos, a wild region
of northern Greece (horse country, for sure), where they practice something
called aeiphatosmosastoupoulos, or "satire using horse manure imagery".
I said he was just making fun of my institutionalization of hired learning.
I'll be reading transcripts from our recorded dialogues from Fargo, MN
at the poetry & public shusphere conference at Rutgers, in room 101
(across from the men's room).

Aldon--

Report on the whiteness conference is fabulous..As someone who's
interested in all these issues ( and consider 'em very germane to poetry),
I found this helpful and fascinating.

This kind of thing is a major service, at least to me.  (..in a very
different way I also value the I-was-there reports of Steve Carll, the
Michael Musto of the SF poetry scene; useful for the deprived who
unfortunately are not (there)....)

You bet. Stephen Dunn certainly is -- in fact I think he played semi-pro in
Spain for a while in his youth. Other versifying NCAA fans -- and Syracuse
fans at that!-- are Robert Lietz and yours truly.  I think Garrett Hongo's
a hoops fan, too, but I'm basing that on a poem of his so take it for what
it's worth.

It does seem, though, that if a poet dares admit to liking a sport,
baseball is the safe one, probably because it's slow, and therefore

An interesting sport to bring up in the company of poets is golf.  I once
mentioned that I played -- or was trying to -- and was immediately brought
up short by another poet who gave me a lecture about how poetry and golf
were incompatible, morally so, as I remember.  This, however, came from
someone who had never played the game, and who assumed that only rich
stockbrokers indulged, ignorant of the fact that almost every summer
weekday evening the links are crowded with hard workin' factory folk
tearing up the fairways with their company leagues.  Par to the people.

Once upon a time there was a village in the hills called Squattle Falls.
People worked hard just to keep the mill open and the jail closed and
the furnace running and the plow polished and the grill hot and the
potatoes fried.  Everybody knew everybody (and that includes Jodie &
Bob over on Lilac Lane).  Barnet S. Robinson of the distinguished
sherriff & militia clan of Robinsons owned a lot of property (right
up against Governor Limpet's estate) & he got richer & richer in a
single-minded way.  His kids were spoiled rotten except Leonard became
one hell of a lawyer & Louise is now chairwoman of the D.A.R. for
Junta County.  Now the Robinson Tool Works is owned by a southeast
Asian conglomerate, and everybody works hard just to make ends meet.
Sprint Blodgett set up a website for Squattle Falls, can you believe
it or not.  You can find out more about us at http://bingo.individuals.org.
Or just ask Professor Weber over there at State U.  He's done a book
that sure pulls it all together, yah.

when I was a child I spent summers in camps in the mountains of pennsylvania
with a bunch of other urban kids. by analogy with snowballs, we used to have
manure fights. This makes me something of an expert. The lady has it.
The deal was to find a turd that had dried enough so that it could be molded
into a proper sphere but fresh enough so that it would still cause offence.

What a relief to tell the story. I have been afraid that this piece of
folklore would die with me and the world be impovrished by its loss.

Poetic sports? Most sports fall into three categories--skills of war, skills
of hunting, forlorn hope that sportstogs will tear in interesting ways (the
greeks combined these by having athletes compete naked). Then there's a
remnant category--skills of labor. My favorite of these is the ox-pull,
practiced at county fairs in New England (and beyond?). A pair of enormous
oxen are hitched to a sledge laden with concrete blocks. The pair gets three
tries at pulling each weight for, I think, ten feet.
What's wonderful about this sport is that the oxen (unlike horses in the
otherwise identical sport of horse-pulling) are truly as stolid as
oxen--they exhibit absolutely no change in affect or mood. As if by
contagion, their human entourage neither. Despite the fact that consistent
losers are likely to wind up as hamburger (analogy with mesoamerican
ballgame?). And also (antecedent--wonderful) that the vast bulk of the time
is spent in loading the sledge further, leading in the teams of oxen,
hitching, rehitching, unhitching, etc.
If the poetic in sports is in proportion to the slowness of the game, this
beats baseball by a mile. The audience, sometimes larger than at most poetry
readings, tends to be on the laconic side--zen farmers who've sat once too
often.
Did you know that if you sit absolutely still for long enough your brain,
responding to gravity, begins to puddle? That's what I love about ox-pulls.

here's the whole poem of which a line was drawn in San Francisco by
O. Mandelstam, trans by McKanes, with improvements (in his mind at
least) by H. Gould:

Birth of the Smile

When a child starts to smile,
with a crease of bitterness and sweetness,
honestly, the ends of his grin
go off into the anarchy of the ocean.

He feels invincibly good,
the corners of his lips play in glory,
already the rainbow stitch is sewn
for the endless understanding of reality.

At the flux and flow of the mouth's snail
the mainland rose out of the water on its paws,
and one world-shouldering moment is revealed
to the slender tune of praise and surprise.

1937.

Translation of course is a poor substitute.  This too was written in
Voronezh in the year of the Terror.  Mandelstam's music of phanopeia/
melopeia/logopeia - his bridge of pathos/joy - is utterly invincible
& is the apex of the M(illenium).  He is maybe close to Yeats - the
same "eagle mind" but without that sort of cat-like feral coldness
Yeats sometimes displays.

One of his few pleasures in exile was listening to the radio.
He wrote this poem after hearing Marian Anderson (she was on tour
in Moscow).

I am buried in the lion's den and into this fortress
I sink lower, lower and lower,
listening to the yeasty cloudburst of sounds
stronger than the lion, more powerful than the Pentateuch.

How closely your voice calls to me:
mankind before the commandments,
like the strings of ocean pearls
and the slender baskets of Tahitian girls.

The strong deep notes of your chastising song
are like an advancing continent.
The savage sweet faces of spoiled daughters
are not worth the matriarch's little finger.

My time is still limitless,
and I abetted the rapture of the universe
the way a quiet organ's playing
accompanies a woman's voice.

[trans. by McKanes with slight improvements]

think of Marian Anderson singing at the Lincoln Memorial in the 30s
over the heads of the D.A.R.  & Mandlestam is listening to her,
over there in Voronezh.  & it's the 30s and it's now.

You know, the stock market
has a fifty point collar
that holds up trading almost
every day these days the
idea being to allow things
to cool off, but when the
lock comes off (the button?)
trading tends to go on at
the same pace as before!
Which is not to draw any

and the stock market, at

Time now to relax & let our memories drift back to 1997, thirtieth
anniversary of the summer of love.

Well, for some perhaps, but for others, 1997 was the year in which the
Subtext@Speakeasy presented the following readings:

May 15
Belle Randall & Drew Gardner

June 19
Leslie Scalapino
(Scalapino will also conduct a workshop on the 20-21.  The workshop is $40.

July 17
John Olson & Christine Stewart


All readings begin at 7:30 pm on the 3rd Thursday of the month at the
Speakeasy Cafe, 2304  2nd Avenue in Seattle's increasingly fashionable
Belltown district.  Suggested donation is $5.

This quadrant of the perennially ongoing series was curated by Bryant
Mason.  (He's also responsible for the following couple of months, but that
information is currently available on a need to know basis only.)

Also, writers from the Subtext collective uber-committee will be featured
readers at the Red Sky reading Sunday may 4th, at 7:30 pm on 14th Ave
between Pike & Pine Streets in Seattle.

Did I remember to make it clear that this all takes place in Seattle, in
the capitol of the United States?

It's in the pitching too. There's poetry in the pitching, or at least I think
so from my few years on the mound. Spicer said poets think that they are the
pitcher when in fact they are the catcher. I think it can go either way; one
can't do without the other. Gerald Early (I think that's right) has a couple of
nice prose articles in the APR on baseball and poetry from last year (summer I
think).

You can add Jack Collom and Michael Friedman to that list. As for me, I had
the distinction of playing on the worst H.S. team in South Bend Indiana -
the Marian Knights - in the early 70's. We went 1-12 before I quit. God, did
we suck! Jack opines that the Bulls are so eminently watchable not just b/c
of their preternatural court prowess but b/c they are easily the most
eccentric collection of players in the league. (Is anyone else beginning to
find Jordan's impersonable perfection cloying? My favorite was Magic Johnson
 - with the possible exception of Cousy and the Big O, the smartest player
ever to step onto the court).

And why is it that baseball (which moves too slowly for me) inspires such
good writing and basketball doesn't? I can only think of two good books on
hoops - Halberstam's _Breaks of the Game_ which unfortunately was written by
Halberstam ("He was Bill. He was Bill Walton.") and John McPhee's marvelous
book on Bill Bradley at Princeton, _A Sense of Where You Are_?

Golf is a truly sublime sport, as anyone who's ever sunk a difficult putt or
knocked the dimples off a tee shot knows. I know Paul Naylor is a player,
but I've never met any other poet who professed to like the game. I'd play
more - but then I couldn't buy books!

You bet. Stephen Dunn certainly is -- in fact I think he played semi-pro in
Spain for a while in his youth. Other versifying NCAA fans -- and Syracuse
fans at that!-- are Robert Lietz and yours truly.  I think Garrett Hongo's
a hoops fan, too, but I'm basing that on a poem of his so take it for what
it's worth.

there's the opening to _What_ now obsolete 'cause of the WNBA

and procrustean Walter Benn Michaels once told me that he knew the west coast
langpo boys best from basketball rather than poesy

and despite bad knees barry watten volunteered for a game in orono that never
took place

and tim bahti once told me a funny story about stanley fish yelling at a grad
student "hey yr not ever to play without me again" or something of the sort as
i guess sf had been forced to the sidelines or wasn't getting his shots

and alan shapiro played as an undergrad at brandeis and sees the court pretty
well and rumor has it once turned down a chance to pick up a game in nc with
mike j. figuring he'd be the only one ever offered that possibility who could
say THAT

and i recommend all you bards send yr books to phil jackson so he can pass
them out to players on the road and you can say that rodman and kukoc didn't
read my book as they hung out in hotels and made $250,000 a night

Now what sort of fun is it if you won't name names?  But I like what
Mencken had to say on the subject: "If I had my way, any man guilty of
golf would be ineligible for any office of trust in the United States."

Fred -- trhere is of course Toby Olson, lovely poet & novelist & golfer
who has a splendid book of the latter variety that deals with golf. --
Pierre


In fact, golf is used as an agent of good (against evil) in Seaview.
A fine novel; morally compatible for even the best golfers.

Up till now, I've resisted the urge to post a poem, but since I'm reading
tonight in Ellsworth (Maine), and since this one comes so close to the
description below, I've succumbed. It's from around 1980, & based on the
Blue Hill Fair, annual Labor Day Weekend event.

                September

Cast-concrete weights, five to the ton.
The front-end loader stacks them on the sledge--
it is the month of the ox-pull.

It looks like a contest for bellies--
men swollen with children, with bills,
swollen with biscuits and Bud.

Oxen wait and wait.
They have no place to go, no reason to go there,
shriveled scars for balls.

All afternoon the weights are added to the sledge;
the oxen strain, lurch forward past the stands,
the Ford-dump gears down and hauls it smoothly back.

Hoofprints and treadmarks in the dirt,
oxshit and oil.

In the stands, ice-cream and polite applause.
They wait all year for this, and then all afternoon.
There's something here I can't make out.
No thin man owns an ox.

Our Okanagan horse bun fights were something like that. Not the soputh
Okanagan is desert country, so horse buns would get crispy dry on the
outside while they were still green on the inside. Perfect for picking up
without disgust and throwing against the other kid's shirt (on the days
when we wd wear shirts), because they would burst and spread. Other good
things for throwing were tree-ripened peaches and clumps of really
high-growing couch grass, whixch you wd swirl and hurl. They wd hit dirt
first.

oh, for me it's all about basketball.  perhaps because i went to my 1sy
bball game when i was 27 days old (my dad's a coach) and thus it has been
a part of my life forever.
but it's not so sentimental, really.
basketball is an art/form.  impossible things happen on a basketball
court.  and they happen because they are confined to that court.  just
like in poetry, impossible things happen--because they are confined to the
poem.  there are rules, forms, a space in which to play, to perform--and
when all of those things are maintained: the impossible happens.  is made
to happen.
no human body should be able to do what chamberlin's or west's or
abdul-jabbar's or bird's or jordan's did/does
and language isn't supposed to do what it does in a poem, what the poet
makes it do.
i suppose you could make this analogy of (m)any sport(s)--but there is
something about basketball--something about the form and formalism of it.
baseball has its infinitude; football and ice hockey their recklessness;
but basketball (and tennis, too, i think) are about form and formalism,
making impossible things happen w/in that form. . .

In an anthology of fiction about sports that I once edited, there was one
story about golf, by David Helwig of Kingston, a poet and fistion writer.
But that's the only one I remember seeing, and IU dont remember any golf
poetry. Wait, didnt that novelist whose name starts with U. write fiction
abt golf?

I have enjoyed being on this list for the past year and a half.  The
discussions are often lively, and I receive a lot of information on
publications, conferences, etc. that I would otherwise not know about.
But I do feel that we should all heed Charles Bernstein's latest
revision of what the list is about.  Note that this is not intended to
be a list for anyone with a vague interest in poetry.  It is intended
for people committed to working through and on innovation.  On top of
that, "poetics" by its very definition involves intellectual
theorizing.  Therefore, it seems to me that criticizing people for
being "high falutin'" or too intellectual on this list is contrary to
what the owner of it intends.  While I don't want to be a police
officer, I do think we should all take note that this list is private
and that it is intended for certain purposes.  If our interests diverge
from those intended by this list, maybe we should try to hook up to a
different one.

A number of people have told me, backchannel, that they no longer post
for fear of being pounced on by others who have not even carefully read
the original post.  Why are we here?

The strangest amalgamation of poetry and golf  I can think of are those
stories of Ted Berrigan, presumably, and oddly, a fan of the sport. At
least one memoir I've read mentions him reading books on the history of the
PGA tour, and he was known to compare the writing of poetry to Arnold
Palmer charging on the back nine on the last day of an important
tournament.

interesting that the word "europe" is parsed (via some or other root) to
mean "west" just as the word "asia" (in like wise) has roots in "east" --

PPS The 50-posts-per-day limit is unfair to Westerners, esp to BC,
Oregon, Washington state & California residents. Unless we're
insomniacs, the dice of the day's debate are loaded against us. Would like
to see some proportional representation system worked out to redress
this imbalance.

proportional, as in, numerically representative of a ratio of subscribers?
(or of just those who post? -- swimmers rather than swimmers +
lubbers)? -- as if one were to take a census & figure out how many are in
eastern U.S. time zone & how many in western U.S. [the two assumed
poles of the above idea] and then ration it out somehow? . . .  and where
does that leave our friends down in Oz? -- or (say) Stephen Paul Miller
(now in Krakow, Poland) or . . .  so, in theory, there could be issues . . .

David B. posted the above-quoted note early in the day on Monday
[from California], but I didn't get it till today [Wednesday] -- it was being
compiled in Wednesday's digest [being a hold-over form a day well past
its 50-limit], till I switched from digest to nodigest mode . . .

David I. [aka moi], on the other hand, attempted to make a post at 4:45
p.m. today (here in the mystic east), and got this response from LaMama
Computer:

I'm thinking of this & trying to reckon (or sourt out) against whom the
dice of the day are/were loaded; but I can't quite reach clear conclusions.
Today, the 50-limit was reached quite early -- and true enough, it was 3
hours earlier in California than in New York; on the other hand, you
westerners get a clean slate & a clear road directly after the New York
Midnight -- which is 9:00 p.m. for you'all, so you've got clear sailin' at
that end of the day, while we -- to participate in any early-list reparte,
must needs burn the proverbial midnight oil . . .

DB also allows:
<<< You  c o u l d  place a ceiling upon the number of postings by an
(excuse the term) individual per day.  db >>>

yes, but some folks have these neat little rejoinders & suchlike, while
others have these fantastic, billowing essayish items -- and how, praytell,
is that to be well-sorted by a mere number-of-posts factor? . . .

in short, I don't really have a position on this.  Another listserv that I
participate in has a number-of-posts limit set at 10 / day -- and that's
something that, there, folks are rarely aware of (once or twoice, I've met
up with it meself, but this indicates my prolixity in that corral . . .) --

yes, there could be some such limit; one thing it would perhaps encourage
would be longer (or even more "thought out" posts) -- but do we
necessarily want either of those forces at the steering wheel ? ?

Although not strictly poetry, but poetics, I have a video show tomorrow
night, Thursday, at 7:00, at the Knitting Factory here in NYC, 74 Leonard
Street. I'm running out of Jennifer, btw, or vice versa, at this point; on
Cybermind and Fop-l, I've been writing about the phenomenology of this ms/

Doctress N's Expose of Jen's Lies


When Doctress N stayed with me a few weeks ago (having come for the launch
party of the Being on Line book), I screened the Jennifer tape for her.
Later, in the middle of arguing, she said she knew now that I wore pant-
ies. I said, no, I didn't wear panties; I wore them for the tape and noth-
ing else. (Since she had seen me naked, she should have realized that.)

Where is this going? For one thing, I'm screening the tape tomorrow night.
For another, her reply was that she was an artist, and she never lied in
her art. The assumption, of course, is that wearing panties on tape and
not in real life constituted a lie, a dishonest art, an art of subterfuge
perhaps - which itself was constituted by the fact that the material on
the tape, its content, appeared somewhat _as if_ I was Jennifer, to re-
suscitate Jeremy Bentham's or Vaihinger's conceit.

A fetish requires maintenance, labor, economics, of a different order and
temporality than artwork, which passes literally from hand to hand. When I
think: Jennifer pushes me borderline, I _do_: Alan pushes Jennifer border-
line. There's no hardness, no uncanny gaze, in the text.

But the primitive conceit of the _truth_ of art (i.e. "her art is honest,"
"she true to herself," "she's a fake," "her art's fake," and so forth)
hangs like a phallus over its irreality. (For if art is a discourse, it is
centrifugal, rim-objects at the subject's horizon generating internally,
ec-centric. Truth _swarms._)

Forge a head.

Small Press Traffic Presents

Friday, April 25, 7:30 p.m.

Talk Series:
Kristin Prevallet on Helen Adam

New College Theater
777 Valencia Street
$5

Small Press Traffic's _Talk Series_ continues with this special event
featuring poet Kristin Prevallet, who will discuss her research on the life
and work of Helen Adam, one of the brightest lights of the San Francisco
Renaissance. Scottish-born Helen Adam (1909-1992) was a mystic balladeer,
who wrote and thought in the language of Dunbar and Ingoldsby while
maintaining intimate friendships with Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Madeline
Gleason, James Broughton, and countless others in the poetry-mad world of
the Bay Area of the 1950s and 60s. A gifted storyteller, collagist and
photographer, she is best remembered for her tragicomic operetta _San
Francisco's Burning!_

Kristin Prevallet's _Perturbation, My Sister: A study of Max Ernst's
Hundred Headless Woman,_ is forthcoming this spring from First Intensity
Press. She is an editor of _apex of the M,_ and is working on a video based
on _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner._ For the past three years she has been
cataloguing the archive of Helen Adam at the Poetry/Rare Books Collection
at SUNY Buffalo.

At this event, Prevallet will give a slide presentation of Adam's life and
times, and will introduce the restored version of _Daydream of Darkness,_
the film made by Helen Adam and the painter William McNeill in 1962-3.
_Daydream of Darkness,_ a poetic film fantasia, was shown only once, at
Robin Blaser's Peacock Gallery on the eve of JFK's assassination, and then
abandoned. In the course of her research, Prevallet discovered the film,
its celluloid near rotting, and has arranged its restoration for this grand
re-premiere!

Please note: Prevallet will be reading from her own poetry at a separate
event this same weekend, at Canessa Park, 708 Montgomery Street, Sunday,
April 27th, at 3:00 p.m. Do not confuse the 2 events-our event is the one
and only Helen Adam presentation!

Friday, May 2, 7:30 p.m.

Joanne Kyger
Dale Smith

New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street
$5

What an event! Joanne Kyger, an active presence in the Bay Area poetry
scene for forty years, has lived the life I've always dreamed of. She's the
author of 14 books of poetry: she's seen it all, she's done it all, and she
grows younger instead of older-my ideal! The friend of Olson, Spicer,
Wieners, Berrigan, and so many more, Kyger has crafted a poetry of
excitement and spiritual revelation which influences the younger generation
of today. The range and energy of her writing seems to re-distribute the
molecules of the air we breathe, and the social space we inhabit. Her most
recent book is _Some Sketches from the Life of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky_
(Boulder: Rodent Press, 1996). This summer she will be teaching at the
Naropa Institute.

Dale Smith returns to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, where he has
recently completed a thesis on Philip Whalen's poetry for his MA from New
College. Smith's writing is always surprising, ranging from elegaic to
formally combustible, but always with a romantic Western undercurrent.
"Wanting/ to live furious, the living/ as distinct a thing as things/
themselves." His work is forthcoming in _GAS_ and _Jejune_ and has appeared
in _Mirage, Exquisite Corpse,_ and _Wired_. With Michael Price he edits the
magazine _Mike and Dale's Younger Poets_. "Other than that, I get high,
read, and hang out with Hoa."

Mister Bowering is confused again.  What he remembers as "gestures"
were, of course, my desperate attempts to hail a cab after that
disastrous night in Granby, Quebec in 1973 (about which the less said
the better).  George had a lampshade on his head at the time and was
alternately singing "O Canada" and reciting from the collected works of
Charles Bukowski (one of his favorites), so I guess he must be forgiven
for his lack of depth perception.

The Lorber information was indeed delightful.  As with the  "BurmaSlave"
campaign, this is much-needed creative linking between social action,
political debate and poetry.

Daniel B., thanx for the updates about Boston/Cambridge.  It should also
be kept in mind that housing struggles are central to just about all of
us, and things weren't better for most people even before the recent
ultra-right attacks on rent-control.  Under the old system, relatively few
people of modest means could get rent-control in Brookline, Cambridge, and
Boston;  the system only applied to a small percentage of the rented
housing stock.  I lived in the 1980s in Somerville, a working class part
of greater Boston where rent control had been successfully trashed in the
seventies..Rents were rising so fast that Somerville natives were being
driven out, dozens of families per week. I sometimes felt impatient with
housing activists in the area, who concentrated for years on the impending
attacks on rent-control, when the housing situation was dire for the
majority of area working-class people, who couldn't get into the small
number of controlled units.  (In Cambridge and Brookline, though not
Boston, there was virtually no link to need; so pertinacity and
connections got some people rent control who didn't need it that much,
while many who did hadn't a prayer--It bothered me how little the local
left understood or cared about the limits of defending what was already in
some ways a corrupt and inadequate system....)

Hey folks, We are gearing up for the Rutgers conference on contemporary poetry,
"Poetry and the Public Sphere," which kicks off this afternoon at 3 p.m. with
talks by Cary Nelson, Maria Damon, and Harriet Davidson.  Thanks to a dedicated
group of crazed graduate students, wacky professors, and mightily talented and
energetic New Brunswick community poets, the conference will be huge, exciting,
and explosive. The full program and travel information is posted on our
website:

http://english.rutgers.edu/poetry.html.

Everyone is welcome!  No need to pre-register.  Tonight, readings by Amiri
Baraka, Tracie Morris, Reg E. Gaines, Aileen Reyes, and Carl Hancock Rux.
After a brief intermission, we will hold a tribute reading to Allen Ginsberg.

For those of you who cannot make it to the conference, Galinsky and Go! Poetry
will be here taping events for a later broadcast and archive on his website
(more information to follow).  Thanks to everyone who helped make this event
HAPPEN.

KC

meanwhile -- after a brief sojourn in Los Angeles about which I speak no
further, it was on to Atlanta and the College Language Association --

The College Language Association recently celebrated its 60th anniversary,
this was its 57th conference, and, as mentioned in a previous post, the
number of white academics in attendance does not seem to have increased by
much in six decades -- not that white attendance is a measure of anything
other than a continuing lack of interest on the part of persons employed
at Historically White Universities and Colleges --

On the other hand -- there were far more students on hand than usual,
though they hadn't meant to be on hand for a conference.  As it happens,
the conference was scheduled for the same weekend as the 17th annual Black
College Spring Break Freaknik, always held on the beaches of Atlanta.
Thursday night as the advance wave of students started checking into the
hotel there was a certain amount of consternation as they discovered that
the place was full of the very English and Foreign Language professors
they were trying to escape --

I won't try to summarize lots of panels, but will tell you of some
characteristic moments --

The first session I attended proved to be one of the most interesting of
the weekend -- Titled "Migration and the African Diaspora in European
Literature," it featured primarily medievalists -- Catherine Johnson of
Georgia Southern U gave a good survey of "Medieval Europe's Struggle to
Re-Define Self after Contact with the Black Moor,"  Reginald Bass talked
about the image of blacks in medieval German literature, and Mario
Chandler, who impressed me very much, read a paper on fictional
representations of Juan Latino, bringing us into one Renaissance (the
Spanish) at a conference where the word "renaissance" was more often
preceded by the word "Harlem."  At the banquet later in the conference,
young Mario Chandler was awarded one of the CLA's small travel grants for
research in Spain.

After some good papers on Wallace Thurman and Jessie Fauset, including one
by Dolan Hubbard, who is working on a book about Thurman, it was on to the
Langston Hughes Society's luncheon with guest speaker Arnold Rampersad.
Rampersad did manage to quote Hughes once or twice, but the subject of his
talk was Jackie Robinson, which was about as close to poetry as things got
that first day.  Rampersad, for all you poet/baseball fans out there, is
working with Mrs. Robinson on the authorized biography, out soon.

As a former Howard University lecturer, I was particularly pleased by the
panel examining the legacy of Arthur P. Davis.  Most interesting to me was
post-panel discussion of Davis's initial hostility to the Black Arts poets
and his later thaw with regards to a few of those writers (_not_ the poets
I might have expected him to warn up to later at all).  Angelyn Mitchell
of Georgetown, whose anthology of African-American literary criticism is a
good teaching tool despite its somewhat narrow selection, spoke of Davis's
work as an anthologist.

That night there was a screening of W.E.B. DuBois in Four Voices, with
the producer/director Louis Massiah there to talk about the film with
those of us who were still awake
after all the receptions at Spellman and the day's arguments.

next morning I was up early for one of the few poetry panels, a session on
Robert Hayden, though I have to say the papers didn't seem to move the
scholarship very far from where it already was.  BUT, Angela Chamblee,
after much difficulty with the AV equipment, put Hayden's Harriet Tubman
poetry back together with Jacob Lawrence's Tubman series of paintings, and
that was great fun.  Bernard Bell chaired a session on Charles Johnson and
Ishmael Reed that featured James Coleman and two of his grad. students,
both of whom did an admirable job with their topics.

I went with great expectations to a panel on the theme of passing in the
works of Charles Chesnutt and Nella Larsen, only to find that two of the
panelists had passed up the opportunity to appear -- Left alone with her
session chair was the remarkably collected and adaptable Tracyann Williams
of CUNY, who, to judge from her talk on Larsen, will make a very good
professor of literature when she gets that diss. done --

Went then to a general panel on "Narratives of Migration, Liberation and
War," where Mary Helen Washington presented some of her work on the 50s,
work that might have been a great addition to the Orono conference last
Summer even though it was not about poetry.  Washington is planning more
50s stuff for the American Studies conference in D.C. in the Fall -- a
revelation to me in her presentation was the news (new to me, probably old
to most of you) that the 1959 Negro Writers Conference [the first ever],
sponsored by the American Society of African Culture had been funded by
the CIA -- The focus of Washington's talk was novelist Frank London Brown
and his realist novel _Trumbull Park_, which I had not known of before but
will now look up.

That night featured the conference banquet and awards.  Octavia Butler was
the featured speaker, and gave an autobiographical address to such
questions as "why write" and "why write that stuff?"

AND for all you Science Fiction listophiles, there is a call for papers
out for a special issue of Callaloo on Octavia Butler -- the person to
contact if you want to give the subject a try is:

Next morning I had the great good luck to be the first speaker on the
first
panel of the last day -- talked about C.L.R. James -- was joined by an
interesting grad. student named Mursalata Muhammad who talked about black
American artists in Europe.

The last panel I got to brought things full circle in an odd way to the
departure from Berkeley -- the subject of the panel was the Middle Passage
-- Sophia Canatave of Tufts talked about literary aesthetics and the
history of Middle Passage, Sheila Smith McKoy (Vanderbilt) spoke of a Kofi
Awoonor
novel I had somehow not heard of yet titled _Comes the Voyage Last_
(anybody out there read that yet?  Awoonor is a poet.)  and Iyunolu
Osagie, of Penn State, gave a paper titled "Conceptualizing Blackness in
Middle Passage Migrations."  This last created quite a ruckus.  Part of
her paper was a sort of wondering out loud about what it might be like to
define blackness in relation to itself instead of in relation to
whiteness.  In the resulting dialogue with the audience there was much
talk of Fanon, and of African/African-American relationships,,,, and then
somebody wondered whether white academics ever talk about the dependence
of the concept of whiteness on the concept of blackness.  I knew a cue
when I heard one, and briefly (far more briefly than I did here)
described the Berkeley conference on whiteness and the fire storm it
caused in the media.  (The media, by the way, left us pretty much alone in
Atlanta -- They had all the freaknikers to get on camera after all.)

Oddest moment of the entire conference came when one young person in the
audience opined that black Americans have never been credited for making
white people possible -- and then the look on his face when he realized
what he'd just said --

folk seen at the conference included
Joanne Gabbin, the aforementioned Bernard Bell, Trudier Harris (WHO is
starting up a society for the study of African-American poetry that should
be of interest to all on this list -- there'll be an organizing meeting at
the American Literature Association in B'more next month -- will supply
info address on request), Jacqueline Jones of nearby (to me) Santa Clara
University, Hugh Gloster (who is gettin' old), Beverly Guy-Sheftall, R.
Baxter Miller, Robert O'Meally, Gay Wilentz and other notables of the
prose world --

which is why Trudier's society is so needed -- again, very little talk of
poetry at this conference -- there's a lot of important work to be done,
but students won't know it's waiting to be done if we never teach any of
the relevant materials -- if we don't get those books back in print -- and
so on, you know the drill --

so, having been made to feel my age by large numbers of exceedingly polite
freaknikers who quickly spotted me as somebody well past forty and thought
they should all tell me that English is their absolutely favorite subject
(and I will choose for the moment to believe every one of them), I flew
back to San Jose

only to find 7,000 fans of TAFKAP (the artist formerly known as Prince)
snaked around my building waiting for the concert I hadn't known was about
to happen - and next morning learned that TAFKAP had encored with a
scorching guitar duo performed with Carlos Santana -- but I did have a
good book to read at least --

love to all, and to all a good night --

sure wish I was going to that Rutgers wing ding to see all my buddies from
the list, though

Actually, as a poet who's a baseball fan(atic), this belongs with Henry's
multitudinous and well-cataloged horse-manure.....Most poets (like most
**real people**) who know the game loathe that movie, precisely because of
the putrid Norman Rockwell absurdity of it (I grew up knowing the sainted
Norman myself, in Stockbridge, and posed for him as a kid--I know from bad
Americana already).

Hi, folks--& David Israel & his Sanskritist friend George Thompson, in

matter--
"Of course the so-called Beats, particularly Diane di Prima, Allen Ginsberg,
and Jack Kerouac were quite familiar with & reading Eliade, but I have not
come across particular use of the term 'sandhyabasha' in the context I was
applying it in the Scripture (Kerouac) preface.  This certainly does not
preclude awareness of the principle, & it surfaces 'in spirit' in the
long-awaited _Some of the Dharma_ (Kerouac) coming out this fall from Penguin
USA.  I see this text as illuminating the profound and interesting link of a
postmodern poetics with Buddhist philosophical/psychological ideas and
practices.  There's so much more to say on this subject!  In haste, Anne
Waldman."    End of transmission.

Hasn't Mark found the real alternative, here, to lurking? I humbly
submit PUDDLING to the multitude! Just puddling along, not really diving
in; puddling through the posts. I dunno, sounds good to me.

About sports, and recent messages concerning same: would anyone be
interested in collaborating on what may not be a RENGA but would
definitely be some sort of post-individual piece on the NBA playoffs?
"I" "myself" (sorry, Mark Wallace _et al_, an ingrained habit) try to
compose some improvisational thing or other on the occasion of the World
Series every year; this would of course be quicker, the associations more
"instanter" as Olson had it, but might be fun.

And finally, if I may be permitted a short excursus on the thread last
week that (briefly) bore my name in the subject line, along with that
Canadian fella . . . my lone, rather small, contribution to the
individual/social conversation was quickly metamorphosed into a
defense of some romantic heroic/artistic individualism which I didn't
recognize as ever having said (although I have nothing against
individuals, some of my best friends . . .) I was concerned, rather, with
what I perceived as the stated likelihood of the artist's work -- by which
I mean yours, mine or anyone else's on this list -- being subsumed by the
institution he or she was a part of: not quite the same thing.

I wish I had Olson's _Selected_ at hand, because I'm now going to butcher
something he wrote (Michael B., are you still around?), something like
"I deplore the current substitution of the social for the cosmos, the
totality" -- that gets closer to what, in this context, I believe.  Me and
Giordano Bruno. And maybe even Henry the Bold, whose remarks on Joyce and
the "real world" a few days back are still ringing.


Not a Boeing Supersonic fan, though currently puddling in Seattle,

Myself I find basketball to be my great love these years, tho maybe i'm
a victim of the generational decline of baseball myth.  Is it true that
baseball is less poetic than it was once, as they report on the tv? Any
of you all ever read Tom Clark's *Fan Poems*, from '76?  May I hazard my
opinion that it was a truly awful book?  A couple monthes ago I set out to
re-write it, using the same title, and now instead find myself writing
paeans to Chris Webber.  Still stuck in '92 with the Fab Five, I guess,
t-ing for one last time out.

i agree / the oft-mentioned "zen" aspect of baseball makes for easy (often
false) parallels

but would anyone be interested in collaborating on a list of
basketbal-to-poetry analogies? i.e., i'll begin with:

dribble = cadence, syncopation
cross-over dribble = line break
slam dunk = haiku

etc.

Dave Z -- thanks. glad to hear of Berrigan's golf interest.

And I do have a couple of golf poems in _Doublespace_ (Segue, 1992)

OK, Rachel, a few names (off and on the list):  Ray Federman (a
seriously addicted and reputedly fine golfer, has played in
tournaments all over the US); Michael Palmer (reported to be quite a
good golfer); the already named Paul Naylor; Alan Golding (sorry,
Alan, Rachel coaxed it out of me.... though Alan is, properly, much
more of a soccer player...); Judy Grahn; Tom Mandel; Charlie Altieri
(I stop now, since I'm beginning to name critics...).  And Rachel,
just think of the clothes--plaid pants, tasseled shoes, strange

It's interesting how conversational and experiencial language is acceptable
in certain threads, like Hoops.  But to ask some one to explain their
conceptual terms through similar experiencial language is frowned upon in
other threads.  When I used the word, 'highfalutin'' in my post to Mark, I
was commenting upon his use of language, as well as my own.  Critical, yes.
But also self implicating, because I chose to address terms like
'individual' and 'social' which are, ultimately, open conceptually.
Intellectual theorizing, debate, and response are different, for me, from
conceptual declaration, as in, "there is no individual."  In the end, these
sorts of exchanges seem fun, lively, and engaging, if not, somehow
clarifying.  But if the posts seem unfair or damaging, perhaps those "with
a vague interest in poetry" should be addressed publicly and taken to task.
Otherwise, how will "innovation" take place?  Thought, it seems, should be
provoked and proved.  And what better place for this kind of exchange than
here, on this list.

By the way, could someone forward me Bernstein's revision.

Hoop Analogs - OK I'll pick it up and try:

palming = rhetorical moment
fast break = open field
steps (traveling) = rejection, give it up
tip off = romantic opener
jump shot = romantic, cosmic aspiration/love
half court shot = cosmic bathos (if it goes in)
defensive elbow = keeping the opposition (unacceptable lingo) out
fake = irony
pump fake = testing the waters
foul = line/lingual abuse. Interesting if you are attracted to damage (if
foul is severe, outrageous)
screen = one word opens another line
double screen = words making other words work
in poems favor.
dunk = dramatic last line that might relieve the pressure
of heavy duty opposition, i.e., knotted language etc.
A 7 ft center (fill in name) and a 5 ft 7" guard (fill in name) = Oxymoron.

No doubt to challenged, revised, or amplifed.
Back to the bench.

I love Bill Marsh's request for basketball/poetry parallels but,
puhleeze, a slam-dunk is no haiku.  Maybe the give-and go, successfully
executed, is.  Or you have to go to baseball for a haiku parallel.
Haiku are all serenity.

Now that I'm into this thread, I have to give into to my taxonomania yet
again and bother you with my division of sports into TARGETEERICAL
SPORTS and CREATIVE SPORTS (tentative terminology).  In targeteerical
sports, the participant tries to hit a target many times through the
repetitive use of one more or less unvarying, highly specialized
physical act: as in the worst case, golf, which is the same swing at the
same unmoving stupid ball, varying only the club (for the most part);
and in bowling; baseball, except for fielding; pool; darts; croquet;
tiddly-winks . . .  In creative sports one one has to react
spontaneously, on the move, to what the opposition does: e.g., at its
best, tennis, which I always thought the most popular sport among poets,
though it has its targeteerical serving component (which with souped-up
racquets and playing surfaces has in my view become too large an element
of the modern game), and of course it finally has the one swing, too,
but it's a swing that has to go high or low, left or right, at a moving
ball; basketball; soccer; ice hockey, and so forth.  But I AM prejudiced
because I'm probably the worst golfer in the world.  Anyway, basketball
and tennis are my favorite sports.

I wasn't aware that there was a recent revision to the list mission statement.
It seems that it has remained unchanged since at least 3-4-97 according to the
welcome message. The recent changes appear to have more to do with keeping "the
scale of the list small and the volume manageable." The scale being the default
on the listserve program, it is more a matter of being able to keep up with the
sheer volume of posts each day, and not a matter of censoring out a list
member's self-censoring, as it were, in an otherwise engaging and list-worthy
thread on individuality vs The State.

On Sunday April 20, San Francisco's Temple Emanu-el was the site for a
memorial service for Allen Ginsberg.  Before the service began, the
performance group City of Poets donned white costumes with patches of shread=
ed
cloth and assembled in the courtyard to read from "Kaddish for Naomi Ginsber=
g"
and "Howl." The cacophony of voices with their erratic movement throughout t=
he
crowd echoed like the wailing of banshees.

I estimate close to two thousand people filled the sanctuary of this wonderf=
ul
building with its symmetrical vaulted arches spanned by a great dome.
Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, Diane di Prima, Mark Lilenthal, Anne Waldman,
Robert Hass, Michael McClure, Joane Kyger, and Andrew Schilling spoke of the=
ir
friendship with AG and how generous he was.  The SF literary communities out=

in force.  To close, the Rabbi led all in reciting Kaddish.  A great afterno=
on.

Seen in the crowd: Carl Rakosi, Floyd Salas, Jack & Adelle Foley, Neeli
Cherkovski, Jack Mueller, Gloria Frym, Jerry Kamstra, George Scrivani, Kevin=

Killian and Bob Gluck (looking for seats), Hilton Obenzinger, Dennis Hopper,=

Whitman McGowan, Margery Snyder, Joyce Jenkins.

April 21's SF Chronicle and Examiner both wrote up the service.  You can fin=
d
these reports at http://www.sfgate.com.

The following came to me as I walked back home.

  with the support of the British Council in the Czech Republic


                 will be holding a seminar entitled


      "Different British Voices - Poetry, Locality, Plurality"

                    on September 12-14, 1997

                  in Brno, the Czech Republic


The seminar will examine aspects of locality and difference in the writing
and performance of poetry in British contexts and beyond.

Leading the seminar will be four widely differing British poets: Richard
Caddel, Maggie O'Sullivan, Lee Harwood and Tony Baker. Like many other
poets currently active in Britain, each of them has established a
reputation for using performence and voice to stress the importance of
locality and to question notions of "centrality" in British poetry and
culture.

The poets will perform their own work and lead a series of seminar
discussions. They will be joined at the seminar by the renowned Czech poet
Miroslav Holub as well as by other Czech poets and translators and, we
hope, by poets and translators from other countries and regions.

The seminar will be of interest and relevance to poets, teachers and
translators.

The cost of the Seminar, including two nights accomodation and meals, will
be in the region of 80 pounds. For further information, or to express

>"A DEFEAT FOR THE MRTA?" AN INTERVIEW
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>Interview With Norma Velazco, European Spokeswoman For The Tupac
>Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
>
>Q: Media reports claim that the MRTA guerrillas were caught
>completely by surprise during the storming of the Japanese
>ambassador's residence. Was the attack by 150 elite soldiers in
>fact a surprise?
>
>     No. The storming of the residence did not come as a surprise
>to us, nor to the MRTA commando in the residency. We always knew
>and said that President Fujimori, right from the beginning, was
>pushing for a military solution. That was proven time and again
>during the occupation of the residency. Even before the occupation
>action began, martial law was imposed on Lima and the harbor area
>of Callao. Many campesinos were arrested without charge and
>accused of being members of the MRTA.
>
>     Then in March there was the discovery of the tunnel, which
>the military had dug from a neighboring house. That made
>Fujimori's intentions clear to all the world. No, we had no
>illusions. All the time Fujimori spoke of a peaceful ending and
>the media reported how a solution was almost at hand. But we did
>have some bit of hope that the international public opinion in
>many countries would increase pressure on the Peruvian government
>and force them to give in. I mean in countries where, unlike in
>Peru, people can go out into the streets and demonstrate for their
>demands. But in this, we were disappointed.
>
>Q: How do you explain the fact that during the storming of the
>residency, all 14 guerrillas were killed - including two teenage
>girls - whereas on the other side, only 2 soldiers and 1 hostage
>died?
>
>     The goal of the MRTA commando was not to murder the embassy
>prisoners. They were determined to have their demands fulfilled
>while providing the maximum protection for the lives of their
>prisoners. There was a struggle between the members of the
>commando and the soldiers. But most of the members of the MRTA
>commando were only killed after the residency had been taken, they
>were most likely tortured as well. Their dead bodies have not yet
>been shown to the public.
>
>Q: Following the storming of the ambassador's residence, was there
>any resistance on the part of the Peruvian people?
>
>     Due to the total militarization of Lima, no such resistance
>is possible. But over the next few days, there will be actions
>carried out all across Peru. The MRTA is prepared for this.
>
>Q: Was the storming of the residence a defeat for the Tupac Amaru?
>
>     Sure, this is a serious defeat for the MRTA; neither the
>movement nor the Peruvian people have gained anything from this.
>But it is not over yet. We lost the battle, but the struggle
>continues.
>
>Q: A few hours after the storming of the Japanese ambassador's
>residence, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori celebrated in an
>exclusive restaurant in the San Isidro diplomatic district his
>most recent victory over "terrorism". It seems that Fujimori has
>emerged from this crisis stronger than when it began.
>
>     If one were to believe Fujimori, this action could never have
>taken place to begin with, since he had declared that the MRTA was
>dead years ago. He will do that now again, but he will be
>disappointed. Fujimori can celebrate his victory for the moment.
>But the problems of the Peruvian people have by no means been
>solved by his action: A vast segment of the population still
>suffer from poverty, hunger, and a lack of proper medical care,
>and these problems are increasing. The end of the crisis at the
>ambassador's residence showed that Fujimori exclusively relies on
>military means; he always has and he always will.
>
>     The MRTA commando always stressed that it desired a peaceful
>solution, and many people in Peru demonstrated on the streets for
>that same reason. The basis for a peaceful solution would have
>been changes in the inhumane conditions which the political
>prisoners in Peru endure. But one thing is clear: There is no
>basis for dialogue with the Fujimori regime.
>
>Q: The stated goal of the residency occupation was to win improved
>conditions for the political prisoners of the MRTA in Peru's
>jails. What will this new situation mean for the prisoners?
>
>     Until now, no improvements in conditions have been proposed
>by the regime. So we must think of new and better ways to win the
>release of our comrades. But the important thing now is for the
>international community not to close their eyes and forget the
>political prisoners and the inhumane treatment they receive.

>
>On April 22, 1997, at 3:00 p.m., military and police units stormed
>the embassy, thereby murdering all the members of our commando and
>one other person, according to reports so far. The National
>Directorate of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) would
>like to report the following to the international community:
>
>1. A new crime has been committed against the best sons and
>daughters of the people, a crime carried out by the terrorist
>regime of Alberto Fujimori, with the compliance of the governments
>of Japan and North America.
>
>2. During the one-sided battle, the members of Edgar Sanchez
>Commando displayed the morale of Tupac Amaristas, the decision for
>victory or death, to stand for the liberation of our people and
>against neo-liberalism, which has only brought our people sorrow
>and oppression.
>
>3. With the murder of Comandante Nestor Cerpa and the members of
>the Edgar Sanchez Commando, the genocidal Fujimori regime seeks to
>convince our people and the international community, once again,
>that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement has reached its end.
>
>4. We, Tupac Amaristas, lower our flags in honor of our murdered
>brothers and sisters, strengthened in our resolve to continue the

>
>5. We say to our people and to our militants all across the
>country, the members of the Edgar Sanchez Commando did not die,
>they have reached the level of heroes, they will be with us during
>all of our mobilizations and actions.
>
>The workers' commander from the people of Tupac Amaru, in all of

>CRITIQUE OF MRTA TACTICS
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>The massacre of the Lima's Japanese residence
>By Juan Ponce (member of Poder Obrero Peru)
>
>On Tuesday 22 April bat 3:17 p.m., Roberto Fujimori, Peruvian president,
>ordered the assault on the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima.
>In approximately 35 minutes the 140-man military-police team where able to
>rescue all except one of the 72 ho stages. In the action all the 14 MRTA
>guerrilla fighters, two soldiers and one judge which was a hostage were
>killed.=20
>
>Three days before the action the Minister of Interior, General Juan Carlos
>Briones, and the police commander, Lt. General Antonio Ketin Vidal,
>resigned. The latest was the person in charge of the capture of the great
>leader of the PCP-Sendero Luminoso, Dr. Abimael Guzman, which conducted to
>the beginning of the downfall of the guerrillas more than four years ago.
>Ketin Vidal was apparently against an armed solution.  For him the path to
>be follow have to be a political one.=20
>
>The operation was a technical and military success. It was very well
>prepared by foreign "anti-terrorist" specialist. The Israeli army, which
>had the most sophisticated and "third generation" electronic devises
>trained a special commando for more than fou r months. According to "La
>Republica" (Lima , 23 April)  the troops entered like moles from three
>tunnels. An AP cable said that they "poured through the compound^=D2s fron=
t
>gate and blasted open the mansion's front door.=20
>
>Others attacked from the rear, and a third unit climbed to the rooftop and
>shepherded hostages down to the ground."  The attack was made in a clear
>day and the MRTA commando was completely took by surprise. Nestor Cerpa,
>the commander in chief, was playing football with some hostages, when it
>happened. Despite that they where heavily armed, they where incapable of
>confronting with so advance technologies and training.=20
>
>Until the moment the official version is claiming that only one hostage
>was killed. Fujimori said 25 other captives were injured in the gunfire
>and explosions that rocked the compound. The Peruvian chancellor, Tudela,
>and few other hostages received some bullets and are hospitalised. Their
>are no more information about that and it could not be annulled the
>possibility that in some more hours more wounded people would not survive.=
=20
>
>Fujimori employed a pure military solution to finish the 127 days
>guerrilla occupation of the Japanese diplomatic house. It begun on 17
>December 1996 when more than 500 VIP where celebrating the anniversary of
>the Japanese emperor in the house of the amba ssador.=20
>
>The MRTA action differed from other guerrilla operations. They didn't kill
>any hostages. In the first day of the occupation they liberated all the
>200 women (including Fujimori's mother and sister) trying to show that
>they are a Macho Latino gentlemen. Some days later they also liberated all
>the US hostages and all the diplomats from Europe, Canada and Asia. They
>only kept 72 hostages which included high Peruvian figures, two tens of
>Japanese businessmen and diplomats, and the ambassadors of Japan and
>Bolivia. In a gesture of "pacifist" will the MRTA freed on the 26 January,
>general Jose Rivas, a top police repressive figure, because he was very
>ill.=20
>
>The MRTA tried to demonstrate to the ruling class and imperialism that
>they where not "savage" terrorists, and that they wanted to open a road to
>a pacific solution which would contemplate the re-integration of the
>Castroite MRTA into the system as it hap pen with its brother
>organisations in Colom bia and Central America.=20
>
>The MRTA didn't appeal to the working class to make mass demonstrations.=
=20
>Despite the fact that they said that they want a change in the political
>economic programme, they didn't strength that point. All the debate was
>around the situation of the MRTA's 400-500 prisoners. They even didn't
>want to a sk for the liberation of the other 5,000 prisoners which belong
>to other forces, mainly to the rival guerrilla organisation, the PCP-SL.=
=20
>The MRTA was founded in 1982 under the influence of the Sandinista's
>revolution.=20
>
>At that time in Peru the PCP-SL was already two years in "popular war".
>The strategy of both organisations where very different.  The PCP-SL had a
>Mao-Stalinist one which con sisted in surrounding the cities from the co
>untryside and establishing fierce four-class dictatorships in their
>liberated zones.
>
>For the Maoists the rest of the political parties where the same thing and
>they kill tens of left-wingers and trade-unionists. They where in favour
>of the physical destru ction of all the workers and peasants organ
>isations and unions which they would not be able to control.  The MRTA
>wanted to appear as a force which was willing to have alliances with the
>United Left, a mass popular front, and the APRA, the bourgeois nationalist
>party which won the 1985 elections, and sections of the army, the church
>and the ruling class. The y used uniforms and had better weapons and
>military sophistication than the Maoists who where mainly poor peasant and
>shanty-towns activists.=20
>
>Their most spectacular action was when in 1990, few days before Fujimori
>became president, they liberated all their prisoners from a new jail of
>maximum sec urity in Lima. In 1990 Fujimori decided to crush the militants
>unions and the guerrilla. His anti-terrorist measures served to destroy
>all working class resistance.  The guerrillas become isolated. After the
>April 92 self-coup in which Fujimori dissolved the parliament, the PCP-SL
>launched a premature adventure w hich tried to produce the capture of
>Lima. They over-estimate their forces and their main leader was captured.
>One year later Guzman decided to radically change his strategy and called
>all his comrades to abandon the "people's war" and to enter in a "p eace
>agreement" process with the regime.
>
>This lead to the demoralisation and division of this former powerful
>guerrilla movement.  At the same time the MRTAs nearly destroyed. In 1995
>Fujimori was re-elected with the majority of the votes. The guerrilla was
>extremely weak, and the workers movement and the left where heavily
>disorganised.  Some months before the MRTA assault on the Japanese
>diplomatic house, the situation in Peru was slowly change. Fujimori
>started to make concessions when he tried to privatise all the petroleum
>company and when he tried to cancel some weeks of the holiday period of
>every worker.  Some sections of t he bourgeoisie, which supported all his
>repressive measures, where beginning to ask for a more open society, to
>moderate the extreme power of the repressive forces, and to make some
>economic changes from an extreme neo-liberal programme.
>
>The MRTA occupation of the Japanese residence divided the ruling class
>into two main camps. The neo-liberals wanted a military solution which
>could allow more privatisation and measures against the organised workers
>movement. The moderate opposition wanted a peaceful solution which would
>weak Fuji mori, could incorporate the guerrillas into the system and could
>allow the development of an internal market.  Peru has one of the worst
>human rights conditions. The political prisoners are judge by faceless
>military courts and could be sentenced to survive until their deaths in,
>what Fujimori call, "living tombs". They could not have access to the
>media, could o nly see the sun in weeks and to receive only one half an
>hour visit per month. The bourgeois opposition accepted that rule because
>for them the "terrorists" are sub-humans. However, they started to realise
>that so much harsh conditions would affect the future of any stable
>society.
>
>In his latest declarations, Fujimori said that the MRTA dropped its
>original demands in favour of the liberation of all their more than 400
>political prisoners to only 20. In Easter a solution was very close to be
>achieve. Japan was pressing for a deal in which the MRTA commando will be
>able to travel to Cuba and would receive in exchange some money, the
>freedom of some minor prisoners (including the partner of Nestor Cerpa,
>the MRTA commander in chief of the occupation)  and to improve the
>situation of the rest of the MRTA prisoners with the aim tto prepare a
>peace process like in Guatemaa.
>
>The latest move indicates that Fujimori decided to implement a hawk

so much I'd like to say about sports    over wine and poorly cooked pasta
(my fault) two other members of the list & I argued for hours in Chicago (if
you didn't know, the best "sports city" in the US, with only Boston and
perhaps Pittsburgh not far behind) about whether there was any difference
between sports (in general) and the arts (in general), specifically
basketball and theater     and cam to no clear conclusions    watching a
game, a good novel
     the ordered & relatively slow pace of baseball must be part of the
poetic appeal--a couple people have said so so far--but to my mind the
appeal is much more in the patriotism baseball is made a symbol of, the
history of it, the fact that it is usually played outside in a stadium
around dusk  those things to my mind make it poetic      but a certain kind
of poetry is evoked  another kind by basketball     I think the aesthetic
I'm associating with baseball is closely linked, through small-town &
borough business-sponsored softball games, to the oxen pull (SP, if you read
this thanks for the poem how was your reading?) described below:

     (((by the by, is watching oxen pull concrete slabs really a sport? or a
staged spectacle? and whats the difference?)))

>>What's wonderful about this sport is that the oxen (unlike horses in the
>>otherwise identical sport of horse-pulling) are truly as stolid as
>>oxen--they exhibit absolutely no change in affect or mood.

     So true! I'm really serious when I remember the first sort of sad
eternal mystical feeling that got me started writing (juvenile) poetry found
its greatest material presence in NH state and county fairs


>> that the vast bulk of the time
>>is spent in loading the sledge further, leading in the teams of oxen,
>>hitching, rehitching, unhitching, etc.

     I always liked this aspect of it as well. Because it was both part of
the spectacle and not at once. I always had the sensation, very enjoyable,
at those fairs of seeing "behind the scenes" while looking directly at them;
an aspect of "carnival" (the adjective) little discussed and related, a
priori or not I'm not sure, to shabiness...


     In other news the Bulls open their post-season-season tonight against
the Bullets   I haven't heard if Dennis will be back tonight, or Toni

     the thing about MJ is he's really an intellectual player now; I swear
he gets the same hang time with his fade away jumps as he used to with his
glides and drives   Bill Wennington said yesterday in the paper that MJ has
invented some little move no one's ever seen before in every game he's been
in for the last five years     and MJ has played every game of every season
since he returned

PLEASE FORWARD TO LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE DEPARTMENTS AND LISTS

Please get a stamp and read carefully.

In the next few days, MLA members will be asked to vote on several
propositions. Some, like the resolution committing the organization to a
more activist stance on the employment crisis, are likely to pass by a
large majority.

Others are more controversial and need to be thought about more carefully.
Chief in this second group are the CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS (1-4 on
the ballot). These all transfer power to the 14-member Executive Council,
taking it from from the 270-member Delegate Assembly (which includes
graduate students, new scholars, and delegates for Composition, Continuing
Ed, Creative Writing, Disabled, Ethnic Studies, Gays and Lesbians,
Independent Scholars, and  Women in the Profession).

The concerns fueling these amendments are often legitimate. But the
crippling of the single most diverse and democratic governance body in any
scholarly society is not the answer.

The MLA Graduate Student Caucus urges MLA members to vote NO or ABSTAIN to
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS 1-4.

Call for Papers -- 1997 SAMLA Conference, Nov. 13-15, Atlanta, GA
Special Session:  Whiteness and Identity

Numerous articles, conferences, and books have recently addressed from
various perspectives the topic of "whiteness."  Areas of interest within
whiteness studies include such questions as whether or not there is a
"white culture"; whether or not "whites" should or do identify themselves
as such; and how the lives of racialized minorities are influenced by the
dominant order's favoring of supposedly white skin, by the pervasive
presence of unspoken "white" values, mores, and presumptions.  How do
authors portray the influence of such forces on the self-conceptions
formed by "people of color" and/or "whites"?  Abstracts are invited that
address how authors (either marked as "white" and/or in other ways)
portray the influence of unspoken whiteness on constructions of identity.

Hank, thank you for that wonderful list.  Judy Grahn?!  Judy, we hardly
knew ye.  But now that you mention it, I think I do remember her showing
up for a reading run-through (long ago) in golf shoes and a little cap.
Silly me, I just thought it was her Valerie Solanas chic.

The University of Pennsylvania Library's Department of Special Collections
presents "Networking Artists & Poets: Assemblings from the Ruth & Marvin
Sackner Archive of Concrete & Visual Poetry." This exhibition is currently
on view from 17 April-27 June 1997 in the Rosenwald Gallery, located on the
sixth floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library. The Rosenwald Gallery is open
to the public Monday through Friday from 9 AM-5 PM; a picture ID is
required for admittance to the library. Van Pelt-Dietrich Library is
located at 3420 Walnut Street (but its entrance is from Locust Walk, at the
statue of the broken button), Philadelphia PA 19104-6206. Parking is
available at 36th & Walnut Street.

Craig Saper, Exhibition Curator, states that, "in the second half of the
20th century, artists, writers, and printers started many alternative
distribution networks for their experimental art and literature. They
circumvented the gallery system with direct mailings and other innovative
ways to reach their audiences and collaborators." Assemblings are an
outgrowth of this desire. "Networking Artists & Poets" represents one of
the largest exhbitions to date featuring this unique material. Assemblings
featured in this exhibition include works by prominent mail artists, Dada
and Fluxus artists, concrete and visual poets, and more.

The Library has produced a 34-page full-color exhibition catalogue for this
exhibition, currently available for $10.00 per copy (check only; we cannot
accept credit cards.) To order a catalogue, or if you want more information
about the exhibit, contact me by phone, mail, or e-mail (numbers, etc., are
listed below).

A few copies of the illustrated catalogue based on Penn's 1993 exhibition
also drawn from the Sackner Archive, "Human Documents: Tom Phillips's Art
of the Page," also remain available from the same address. (They also cost
$10.00.)

Thanks,

Greg Bear

One reason why the Bulls are so much fun to watch is that they are so old.
The old teams were pretty successful and interesting to watch. this year.
The Jazz are old. The Sonics are pretty old. The Suns are old. The &*%$#@!
Knicks are old.

Also, the Bulls are so international. They have an Australian, a Canadian,
a Croat (or is he a Serbian--I cant remember or tell the difference), a
Martian and a bunch of USAmericans.

Okay, I will admit to the lampshade. And maybe I did sing the national
anthem once, maybe twice. But that wasnt Bukowski I was reading. It was my
old rap sheet before I reformed and learned poetry. All I used to do before
Rachel saved me , was drink beer, go to the track, pee my pants, and get
into fistfights and lose them.

Little Apocalypse

poems by Wendy Battin

ISBN #0-912592-40-0
$10.00 pbk.

Amid the incoherence of things, between the coarse lines of dissolution;
after our last photogenic war, the "fever-vivid" language of Wendy
Battin's Little Apocalypse threads between lucidity and lyricism, surface
and depth to the very fovea of the song. An exquisite collection.

David Bromige, hi--I was referring, way back, only to the intro that
Robert Pack wrote for his selection of poets in the 1962 edition
of New Poets from England and America, not to the individual
poets therein. And to the implicit argument of Pack's intro. It is an
argument that supports the following in my view. The poet Ginsberg enters
the social arena of Time policed by the journalist, only on condition that
poet substitutes for poem, agency conflates with agent--i.e. on
condition that the poem itself disappears, and that agency is contained
in one individual, Ginsberg, whose reception is governed by the
journalist. Thus the journalist can say, Ginsberg's popular because of his
media-tuned personality, that's all. Ginsberg anticipates this reception
in his poetry at times, formally--in other words, he anticipates the
conflation of agency with agent by assuming it, sometimes to be critical
of it, sometimes to use it to go somewhere else, sometimes to ride on it.
I do read the '62 antho backwards. Thanks for the reminder that the first
edition came out in '58.

/

I like this version of the Moore poem for its ending:

POETRY

I too, dislike it:
there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
The bat, upside down; the elephant pushing,
a tireless wolf under a tree,
the base-ball fan, the statistician-
"business documents and schoolbooks"-
these phenomena are pleasing,
but when they have been fashioned
into that which is unknowable,
we are not entertained.
It may be said of all of us
that we do not admire what we cannot understand;
enigmas are not poetry.


(from A Survey of Modernism, eds. Riding/Graves, 1928)


/

And here for no direct reason at all, in a slippery language befitting the
email context, the first sentence from an essay, "Topping," by Clint
Burnham, in the latest BOO magazine:

"Today our cultural and political world is characterised by two
contradictory attitudes or ideologies: global diversity and absolutist
monism."

Paleeze!  It's certainly a good idea to bother state senators whenever
possible with one's poems, but there are certainly greater social justice
issues than rent control and whatever ideas you may have about being
persecuted by your landlord.  What about the failure of our government to
build more affordable housing for low and moderate income tenants and the
general gutting of HUD happening this year?

I can't speak for New York or Massachusetts, but here in California rent
control (without vacancy decontrol) helps upper middle class tenants over
and above everyone else.  In fact, just about every major demographic
study of both Santa Monica and Berkeley shows rent control (without
vacancy decontrol) DECREASED the number of low and moderate income
tenants as the housing market shrank.  Ethnic diversity took a dive too.
Now I'm talking about rent control not rent stabilization.  They
ARE different.

Anyway, the poetics list isn't the place for me to take issue with Daniel
Bouchard or to note the fact that I generally agree with him on poetry
and politics.  Anyone who wants to backchannel and have me crunch the
numbers for them I'd be happy to.

Anyone who wants a unit with hardwood floors and a liberal-lefty poet
landlord on premises in Santa Monica, forget it.  It's rent controlled so we
never have vacancies.

Actually, it's THINKING THE SAME THING WITH MORE THAN ONE MIND

I'm working on some poems under title "Somas" Ideas coming out of long
embracing of theme and recent readings such as:
David Abrams' The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception & Language in a More
than Human World;
Morris Berman's Coming to Our Senses: Spirit and Body in the Hidden History
of the West
The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property by Lewis Hyde. I talk
about these things in the frequently modified prose texts on my web site,
but they are also being processed at another level in "poet" mind.

Here is a recent one. (the stanzas are meant to appear on the page in two
columns, with slightly different typefaces and alternately aligned --  one
flush right, next one left and so on ... sort of "interlaced", formatting
impossible via e-mail.)

title: Bicameral Breakdown (a nod to Julian Jaynes)

Language, as Beckett supposedly said
(or was it Ionesco?) is something
gone wrong with the silence.

Is it possible some of those pages you
lost or discarded were precisely the ones
that might have supplied the meaning,
the missing phrase?  Could they be
alive somewhere and growing,
like the children whose faces adorn
or deface milk cartons?

Idiot and idiom derive from
the same Greek root, meaning
private one's own, Gramsci noted.

Writing:  an act so simple it isn't
worth mentioning. An action so brutal
it can separate, temporarily, left from
right, body from mind. Chained to
the cyclic tortures of sleep, the fallible
body is bottleneck, switchboard, ground.

Being in the present
observes Anne Klein
is always interesting.

Sometimes you flare up, demanding
fairness, attention, sanity.
Sometimes you lose your temper,
becoming unfair, inattentive, insane.
This release is a mild stimulant,
about as harmless (or harmful) as coffee,
depending on your metabolism.

Revolts, Pasolini suggests
are fed by a secret anxiety for order.

Is the whole thing merely a
swirl of indifference, you ask yourself,
an ocean of chaos
where we shore up islands of light?

The passions are numberless,
you vow to extinguish them all.

But not yet.

This is a recent exchange I had with a friend who is very involved in
working with Amnesty International. I see this as a free speech issue and
wonder how other on the poetics list see it. I received the following:

Date: Mon, 21 Apr 1997
From: Veronique Fourment <vero@igc.apc.org>
To: lapalma@mail.well.com
Subject: FW: Help block Neo-Nazi group

Hi Marina,  Hope you can use this , pass it on ...       A bientot,

"We understand that Nazi groups are trying to create (again) a usenet group
where they want to keep in contact with each other  regarding their
activities. I believe it is not necessary to dwell further on these activities.

The group is rec.music.white-power

To create such a group, they have to win a referendum that is always
organised when a new usenet group is created. All persons with an email
address, and only those, can vote in this referendum.

It is important to vote only once, otherwise the vote is cancelled.
To prevent the creation of this group, you have to:
1. Send this message to people you know
2. Send an email to the following address:
          music-vote@sub-rosa.com
  with as contents (not 'subject') ONLY the following line:
         I vote NO on rec.music.white-power
 Since the vote is automatic, it is IMPORTANT to send the exact line
 as it is given above, without adding anything, not even a name.
 And please send it only once or it becomes invalid !


I replied:

Dear Veronique -- Of course the first reaction of any decent human being is
"Neo-nazi groups? Let's STOP THEM now!" But I wonder whether the specific
blocking of such a net communications group by a referendum isn't a
repression of free speech? How can we hope to change their minds and hearts
by not letting them speak to one another? Since it is their actions we must
block, mybe it's better to have neo-nazis typing their ugly and pathetic
ideas (and their addresses etc.) because then we/others know where they are;
can WATCH them, as KlanWatch does with the KKK. And can repond to them. If
we agree that the democratic antidote to free speech one disagrees with is
more free speech, then (assuming that usenet groups interchanges, like most
electronic communications media, are permeable) reasonable people could in
fact monitor, publicize and comment upon neo-nazi exchanges. Otherwise I
fear we simply risk setting precedents for the "blocking" of groups that
want to talk about, say, gay rights or trans-gender issues, organize
anti-nuclear sit-ins or share information on obtaining marijuana for medical
uses, or whatever someone else might see as wrong or evil.

Is the use-net considered a "private" medium, a club where we have the right
to exclude material we object to. The first time someone in a neo-nazi
usenet group advocates any act that is illegal or violent, it can be brought
to the attention of potential victims, appropriate civil authorities or
whatever, whereas if they do it in a secret meeting in their houses how will
we know? Anyway, these are my thoughts tonight. What do you think? I will
certainly let people know this thing potentially exists and is something to
keep an eye on.   Love, Marina

Golf is a great game, and I'm a fanatic. If you play it well (I don't) it
verges on a sport. Hank Lazar and I have repeatedly discussed playing a
round together -- Hank is a *serious* fanatic.

As to roundball, I assume you all know that Kit Robinson, one of the really
great poets of our time in my opinion, is also a pretty good basketball
player. He was the center on the Computerland corporate team for most of
the years that he (and Ron Silliman, and Alan Bernheimer, and Bill Luoma,
and others of the bay area poetry community) worked there. Kit is captured
driving the basket in one of Warren Sonbert's later films (apologies, but I
can't remember which right now).

What about ping pong? How can we not mention ping pong, another great
language game. Joan Retallack is an *excellent* ping pong player; she has a
table in her garage. I can beat her though; I am a reeeally good ping pong
player! I take on all comers. What about it?

I'm finally breaking down...and adding to the baseball(golf/hoops) thread,
a citation for my all-time favorite irresponsible book in the universe (in
certain moods, my all-time favorite book, period)--Mikhail Horowitz's Big
League Poets, from City Lights: the ultimate collision of baseball and
poetry. The outrageous text, I could quote from; but it has to be seen in
conjunction with Horowitz's remarkable photomontage caricatures of
everyone from Homer to Baraka as ballplayers.  (Just one line; one of
Pound's achievements was "to be the game's first designated hitler"--)

For the (surprising) number of folks on the list who sound as fond of
baseball as I am, this is really required.

One more addition to the list -- the title poem of Don Paterson's

You will notice that no one received any mail on friday as the list
exceeded its daily limit of 50 messages and I was not available to "free
poetics" (which is the listserv command I send to release the held
messages). I apologize for having other things to do, like the current
Zukfofsky conference: yowie it has been great! The combination of Mark
Scroggins, Ira Nadel and Paul Zukofsky on one stage was too much for me. I
loved it! They were all great and it was the first real congenial
conversation I've ever witnessed in Buffalo. Joseph Conte gave one of the
best and most useful papers I've seen here while the "Man from Maine" Burt
Hatlen (who surely stands 7 feet tall) exercised his readerly prowess
while dangling us over the precipice of A-13.  I'm also moving out of my
apartment into the street where I hope to get to know what it is like to
be online and have no place to live. I hope to be at the public library
again sometime soon.

Y'all in the mean time might think about adding a little to your posts,
perhaps not sending a post to every post you see (but rather taking it in
a little before responding). It's not volume of posts but quantity that
causes this problem. besides, if you've got nothing to do, what's to keep
you from writing in the same message??   just an idea, a suggestion, if
this sounds too much like hitler for ya, well, you can stuffa baloney
sandwish through the lines--i'm really hungry--   love and kisses, your
friendly poetics janitor

Sport is in the eye of the beholder. Basketball has always struck me as
balletic. Spectacle without the swans.
For those of us old enough baseball has little to do with patriotism except
for the relative democracy of the sandlot, and not much to do with norman
rockwell or suburban anything. It was the dust of an empty-lot game or
timing the action for between the cars in a side street stickball match. You
didn't need much--no court, no hoop, just a ball, a few shared gloves, and
any kind of bat-substitute. And no adult intervention.

        By far one of the best books by a poet on/with/for baseball is
Willie's Throw, by Paul Metcalf.  You can read it at Karl Young's Light
and Dust Poets at
http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm

        Metcalf includes the box score of the game he's working with--box
scores being in themselves a form of poetry.

        I have often thought an interesting method of "literary
criticism" could be developed by applying Bill James' Sabremetrics to
writers.  (See James' superb Historical Baseball Abstract as example--)

        A good deal can still be learned from a favorite book of Virginia
Woolf's (and mine--i reread it each Spring Training in preparation forthe
season.  TIME BEGINS ON OPENING DAY as they say)--You Know Me, Al by Ring
Lardner.  Lardner knew how to telegraph voices.

        "Shut up he explained."

        Also recommended:  The Glory of their Times (interviews with
ballplayers from the first two decades of this century) and Baseball When
the Grass Was Green.    Paul Metcalf's first book, Will West, is about an
American Indian pitcher . . .

>>Hurston Plays Discovered

      Find at Library of Congress May Shed New Light on Black
     the Writer

     By William Triplett
  Special to The Washington Post
     Thursday, April 24 1997; Page B02
    The Washington Post

      The Library of Congress staffers were just looking for a
                 little lunch-time entertainment, but they came up with a
         slice of literary history: 10 carbon copies, largely
             forgotten, of play manuscripts by the late African American
        writer and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston.

         Alice Birney, a literary specialist in the Manuscript
        Division, coordinates the library's Performing Arts Forum,
.            whose members meet monthly over lunch to hold informal
                readings of dramatic texts that are in the public domain.
                After a recent meeting, Birney said, a forum member
                suggested doing something by Hurston. A subsequent check
                into copyright records turned up the 10 scripts, all of
                which had been submitted for copyright between 1925 and
                1944 as unpublished plays.

                Four of the scripts -- "Woofing," "Poker," "Forty Yards"
                and "Lawing and Jawing" -- are short sketches in dialogue
                form. The remaining six -- "Cold Keener," "De Turkey and de
                Law," "Meet the Mamma," "Polk County," "Spunk" and
                "Mule-Bone" -- are full-length works. Only the last two
                appear to have been published, but not until 1991 and after
                adaptation to another medium.

                Victoria Sanders, a literary agent who represents the
                Hurston estate, said yesterday that the heirs have known
                about the scripts in the library's collection "since the
                early '90s, when a copyright search was done." Indeed, a
                1989 bibliography of Hurston's works included all the above
                titles. It did not, however, indicate whether copies of the
                works still existed.

                Several Hurston scholars contacted yesterday were intrigued
                by the discovery.

                "There isn't that much of [Hurston's] work that survives,"
                said Patricia Willis, curator of Yale University's
                Collection of American Literature. "That's what makes this
                discovery so exciting."

                "This is very significant," said Joellen Elbashire, curator
                of Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center,
                which is considered, along with Yale, to be among the most
                extensive repositories of Hurston manuscripts. Yet Yale and
                Howard combined have copies of only three of the 10 titles
                found in the library. According to Lois Hurston Gaston, a
                Hurston heir, it's uncertain whether there are copies of
                the other works in other archives. The library's seven
                "might be the only copies," she said.

                Moreover, as Robert E. Hemenway, chancellor of the
                University of Kansas and author of a Hurston biography,
                said, "All 10 are going to be of interest to scholars"
                because Hurston was known for using a given title for more
                than one work. For example, "she wrote a number of things
                called `Polk County,' " Hemenway said. The script in the
                library's collection "may or may not be" the same as any of
                the other identically titled works.

                Hurston, who grew up in Florida and studied at Howard
                University before moving to New York, was known primarily
                for her novels, in particular "Their Eyes Were Watching
                God," published in 1937. But she had a diverse career that
                included stints as teacher, journalist, librarian and
                anthropologist as well as dramatist. She became a key
                figure in the Harlem Renaissance and, in the words of Kathy
                A. Perkins in her book "Black Female Playwrights," was
                eventually "the most prolific and widely published female
                black writer of her era."

                Still, Hurston was unable to support herself through her
                writing, which at times provoked attacks from black
                intellectuals. "She was criticized for perpetuating
                stereotypes in her work," said Kristy Anderson, an
                independent filmmaker who is making a biography of Hurston,
                who died in poverty and relative obscurity in 1960 at the
                age of 69.

this reminds that Meher Baba was quite fond of ping-pong, and is said
to have played very well.  (He also favored a game called "7 tiles"
--more a local Maharashtra sport, I think).  It's hard to mention
ping-pong w/o recalling ping-pong diplomacy.  I'd be happy to go a
round w/ you sometime, Tom, though I can't claim to be an expert.

I much enjoyed Huun-Huur-Tu's concert up at Symphony Space (NYC) a
couple-three years ago (had a nice cassette of theirs, too, but don't
know what became of it; this was before I had a CD player) . . .
Tuvan music is wonderful -- but it's ESPECIALLY wonderful live.
(Perhaps that's true of most lovely musics.)

Another entry in Armand Schwerner's international lineup also seemed
of some note:

> Margi Madhu, kudiyattam dancer

that's, if I'm not mistaken, a dance-form from Orissa (north Indian
state on the east coast, next to Bengal) -- I saw one kudiyattam
dancer years ago in Berkeley & was much impressed w/ the lyricism of
the form -- indeed remarkable.

The Dragon Bond Rite composer, Jin-Hi Kim, was featured on the cover
of an issue (which naturally we called the "Jin-Hi Kim issue") of EAR
Magazine, circa 1990.  She plays a remarkable Korean instrument w/
long strings -- probably similar to the old Chinese chin -- which I
think is the same instrument about which Chuang-Tze had that lovely
tale (circa 3rd century BC), abt. two friends.  One played the chin,
another listened.  The listener and player were in such perfect
accord, that when the former died, the latter broke the strings of
his chin -- for there was remained no one able to hear the music as
it should be heard. . . .

I wonder of A. Schwermer might be willing to say a word or two about
what he's written for this new music/theatre work (playing, as noted
in post of yesterday, in NYC in early June) -- and if (for instance)
it has any spoken words, or what? . . .

Yes the folks at Yale do so let.  They let me submit for several
years running -- I sent 'em my MS *Orison* twice, and I think I sent
'em my MS *A Bowl of China* twice (last time being in February 1996).
At that point I thought it was my final submission.  But this year,
I realized that, since I was still just 40, I could give it one last
shot.  But somehow or other, I inadvertantly let the deadline slip by
w/o getting the MS in the mail (& the $25 entry fee check with it).

So I've been spared from fame & glory after all (oddly).  The Yale
Younger Poets competition has but two entry requirements: one must
(i) be 40 years or younger, and (ii) have never yet published a
po-book.  Guess I was drawn to the Yale game mainly bec. W.S.Merwin
and John Ashbery -- two of my serious faves -- had both published
first volumes under that august (if not to say septemberal) rubric.
(Now it's added to my annals of non-history.)

best,
d.i.

 There comes a time in the life of (    ) when "one" must risk
sounding STUPID or at least UNTHEORETICAL....
And, concerning the questions raised by the phrase
"there are no individuals", one may, I think, respond that
to say THERE SHOULD BE NO INDIVIDUALS (or at least they should be consigned
to something that doesn't have the status of poetry) is not the same as
saying THERE ARE NO INDIVIDUALS.....
and so what about this GAP?
We can retheorize alot,
The esso of individualism can become the EXXON of
"false consciousness subject position" etc.
but what about "EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF" or James Brown
"I GOT MINE DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM".....
Oh, we're SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT....la di da....
we could cry, in unison (as in inversion of that scene in "life of brian"
concerning said individual)
But lets say one may find that he has many of the symptoms
of TUBERCULOSIS, and let's say that one has no HEALTH CARE and can not afford
healthcare....
Well, if there are no INDIVIDUALS, this shouldn't be a problem, right?
Because "ask not for whom the TUBERCULOSIS tolls, it
tolls for thee" and "I can almost smell your tb sheets" and
we can all check into the FUND FOR POETRY'S HEALTH CLINIC that allows one to
be properly diagnosed and then given the cure. How far does "community" go?
So, how does one GET OVER TB without having to check into a hospital? Does
one simply die?
Oh, of course, these questions have nothing to do with poetics....
Write this 100 times on the board....

The treatment for TB is usually a triple drug therapy for 1-2 years,
(usually provided free by a local public health clinic, as it is in their
interest to stop the spread of this contagious disease within a
population.) If one suspects they may have TB, it is paramount that they be
immediately diagnosed and treated. Hospitalization is usually for one week
and is ONLY for those whose diagnosis is still unclear and who may be
contagious.

not sure that either the original leapin' hypothetical, nor the
helpful medical clarification, have altogether illuminated my
understanding of the theory and practice of non-individuality.

For the record (but not the CD, shy goto ex-dreams?), I'll say this:

imho, individuality was not recently invented, nor will it be soon
stamped out.  It is an essential trait of "the soul in illusion" --

and well-founded rumor has it that "a spark of individuality"
survives even nirvana & the subsequent nirvakalpa samadhi.  Vide
(for instance) Meher Baba, *God Speaks* (Dodd, Mead & Co.,
1955), *passim*, for many useful (& I dare say clarifying)
details of this overall (or, forsooth, oversoul) ur-narrative.

best,
d.i.

This is indeed exciting! Being from her neck of the woods (Brooksville, a small
town some 70 miles west from Eatonville where she grew up, and where she
collected much of her folklore), I follow her work with a keen interest. She
has helped preserve the idiom of a people who, though they lived in abject
poverty, celebrated life richly in their language and customs. I hope that
these plays and their lively language are all published together soon.

RE:

>>Hurston Plays Discovered

      Find at Library of Congress May Shed New Light on Black
     the Writer

     By William Triplett
  Special to The Washington Post
     Thursday, April 24 1997; Page B02
    The Washington Post

      The Library of Congress staffers were just looking for a
                 little lunch-time entertainment, but they came up with a
         slice of literary history: 10 carbon copies, largely
             forgotten, of play manuscripts by the late African American
        writer and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston.

         Alice Birney, a literary specialist in the Manuscript
        Division, coordinates the library's Performing Arts Forum,
.            whose members meet monthly over lunch to hold informal
                readings of dramatic texts that are in the public domain.
                After a recent meeting, Birney said, a forum member
                suggested doing something by Hurston. A subsequent check
                into copyright records turned up the 10 scripts, all of
                which had been submitted for copyright between 1925 and
                1944 as unpublished plays.

                Four of the scripts -- "Woofing," "Poker," "Forty Yards"
                and "Lawing and Jawing" -- are short sketches in dialogue
                form. The remaining six -- "Cold Keener," "De Turkey and de
                Law," "Meet the Mamma," "Polk County," "Spunk" and
                "Mule-Bone" -- are full-length works. Only the last two
                appear to have been published, but not until 1991 and after
                adaptation to another medium.

                Victoria Sanders, a literary agent who represents the
                Hurston estate, said yesterday that the heirs have known
                about the scripts in the library's collection "since the
                early '90s, when a copyright search was done." Indeed, a
                1989 bibliography of Hurston's works included all the above
                titles. It did not, however, indicate whether copies of the
                works still existed.

                Several Hurston scholars contacted yesterday were intrigued
                by the discovery.

                "There isn't that much of [Hurston's] work that survives,"
                said Patricia Willis, curator of Yale University's
                Collection of American Literature. "That's what makes this
                discovery so exciting."

                "This is very significant," said Joellen Elbashire, curator
                of Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center,
                which is considered, along with Yale, to be among the most
                extensive repositories of Hurston manuscripts. Yet Yale and
                Howard combined have copies of only three of the 10 titles
                found in the library. According to Lois Hurston Gaston, a
                Hurston heir, it's uncertain whether there are copies of
                the other works in other archives. The library's seven
                "might be the only copies," she said.

                Moreover, as Robert E. Hemenway, chancellor of the
                University of Kansas and author of a Hurston biography,
                said, "All 10 are going to be of interest to scholars"
                because Hurston was known for using a given title for more
                than one work. For example, "she wrote a number of things
                called `Polk County,' " Hemenway said. The script in the
                library's collection "may or may not be" the same as any of
                the other identically titled works.

                Hurston, who grew up in Florida and studied at Howard
                University before moving to New York, was known primarily
                for her novels, in particular "Their Eyes Were Watching
                God," published in 1937. But she had a diverse career that
                included stints as teacher, journalist, librarian and
                anthropologist as well as dramatist. She became a key
                figure in the Harlem Renaissance and, in the words of Kathy
                A. Perkins in her book "Black Female Playwrights," was
                eventually "the most prolific and widely published female
                black writer of her era."

                Still, Hurston was unable to support herself through her
                writing, which at times provoked attacks from black
                intellectuals. "She was criticized for perpetuating
                stereotypes in her work," said Kristy Anderson, an
                independent filmmaker who is making a biography of Hurston,
                who died in poverty and relative obscurity in 1960 at the
                age of 69.

Mark of DC & Jeff of Mpls ('there are no individuals" or - perhaps significant
difference - "in writing there are no individuals") and Henry of Providence
("individuality is the divine analogy sacred must not be tampered with you
benighted totalitarians") are paradoxically only half-right & thus wrong;
this is the essence of idealization/abstraction/mis/communication.  Jeffrey
Timmons asked is there a common ground; perhaps it might be found among
other places in Aristotle's Poetics, the ur-text of "poetics": where tragedy
is described as the ultimate form of poetry because it joins action and reflect
ion, indissolubly, in an image of suffering which evokes identification
(pity & fear) as well as evaluation (reflection).  The meaning of humanity
is action/reflection; there is no individual in the abstract; the idea of
individuality is a social construct; we know of great historical "individuals"
simply because of their mastery of the social, the communal; and yet what is
action without character, what is the social without the bond of individuals
(love, kinship); individual-social mirror one another in life and in writing;
life is double, action is double, writing is double, analysis is double,
halves are part of one, halves are individual parts of one whole; etc. And
we are each 2-sided creatures (left,right) (front,back), & one & unrepeatable.
(or if repeatable, the repetition of a singularity).

We are rational animals, fumbling & then understanding; fumbling in our
understanding & correcting incorrectly in our actions. TB will be dealt with
by people who are secure enough in their individuality to help out in the
community.  (Though how did they get so secure?  Was it love or was it
Daddyo paying for college? Both, double, double, O world, let go the superflux)

(From Oswald O.)

I'm sitting here in tshirt and pants, worrying about a future in death
And hackers screwing up my system and my arms and legs leprosy and lies
So there's nowhere to go but into machines and I've lost the will to live
Which is why I say in the middle of the night thank god for the rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

I'm sitting here in combat and drinking long gone brew of blood and wine
And you might think it's fine and that we're walking the party line
But the sides are smashed with needles and vials and vile's the weather
today
So thank God for the pounding on windows and roof thank God for the
nighttime rain

And she offers me water, she offers me wine, she offers her body as well
Cause she knows I've returned, whole villages burned, I've been through
the weather of hell
The war's just begin, there's blood on the sun, there's blood on the
harvest moon
And I'm throwing the cards, hanged men and hanged girls, they're sowing
another rune

And you might think I'm dressed in armor, leaning down from the pulpit for
cards
But I've wounded myself, I've lost my way, in the woods where the runes
send off sparks
And flames reach for the skies, they cover her thighs, the runes scream,
they're burning bright
She buries herself in my burning flesh, thank God for the storm and the
rain

Pattie Hearst walks again with the strong Weathermen, Black Panthers are
loading their guns
Em-Sixteens are ready, our bodies are steady, we're off to the hills at a
run
Lord Jesus will keep us, Death will not reap us, revenge is the truth of
the day
And nighttime will hide us, the ghetto abide us, we're waiting to kill and
to pray

And you'll find me here in bluejeans and tshirt, roaring down the wires at
you,
You'll see me in the flaming sky, holy embrace with Janis and Jimmie and
The Owl
Pure windows opened up flaming skulls where we'll take the boat to Nam's
pure booty hell
And celebrate our love beyond your cracked dull thought, and thank God for
the thunder and rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

Linda:
        Thank you for the useful information, but it doesn't really seem
to address the issue Chris Stroffolino (also usefully) raises [though it
flashes a gleam of hope that in some yet hard-to-envision future one
might not feel the need to raise such issues]. "The law is no respecter
of persons," and no more (or much less) of individuals: i.e., as you
note, the free treatment afforded to TB patients derives not from concern
for the individual sufferer, but in reaction to the threat to the
collective "society" (which includes, of course, the "individuals" who
offer such therapeutic largesse)--a fact which seems to emphasize rather
than obviate the urgency of Chris' point.

Perhaps I misread Chris' 'urgency' as I thought I heard a distress signal
above  the question of individuality. Call it priorities. (Mine.)
Information is what I brought to the discussion. Simply that. Without the
common good, most of us wouldn't be here to intellectualize about the
individual and contagious disease.

I also thought I heard that distress signal, and wrote him off-line. A
very close friend of mine, ex-wife, was in his situation here in New York.
TB is spreading in the city, as far as I know.

The sequel to the brain-busting crunch month of poetry in San Francisco.
Our story resumes on Saturday, April 19th at New College as Small Press
Traffic presents Elizabeth Willis and Steve McCaffery.  Dodie Bellamy
introduces Elizabeth, who reads poems such as "A/O", "Human Abstract"
(Willis', not Blake's), "Piet a Terre", "Catalog Resin A" (for Richard
Dodd), and "Without Pity" to a crowd which included Lyn Hejinian, Avery
E.D. Burns, Leslie Scalapino, Douglas Powell, Sam, Rodrigo Toscano, Ron
Silliman, Peter Gizzi (of course), Norma Cole, Steve Dickison and Tina
Rotenberg, Cydney Chadwick, Mary Margaret Sloan, Paul Hoover and Maxine
Chernoff, Jean Day, Mary Burger, Elizabeth Robinson, Renee Gladman and
Stephanie Baker.  Some great Liz lines I caught were:

flower is becoming a graph
idea three:  only one violet
H:  the heart of a flower
flower in the heart of the flower
the spirit fell, and you knew it because you were earthly
this is my reference to the amity of sand
whoever called light discreet?
if I err, I am, and my error moves me
desire is a form of fastening
the love of fertile ground can be a kind of phobia
everything appears to shine, given enough darkness
trees have the only real land legs
to fashion oneself wholly on dogs

Steve McCaffery then held the floor spellbound for awhile, reading from
"Serbia Mon Amour", "Critique of Cynical Poesis", "Broad Topics", "What As
Poetic", and _Teachable Texts_.  Here are some lines of his:

there are stars above a piece of soap someone just happens to have dropped
into a movie
the sutra through its murmur is bound to offend
a duel is not a social contract
the route of writing not the round of language
I is another; we are not alone
property droppity plops
my mouth is earth's scholar
the disambiguated geese
just opening mnemonics to a type of shore
fiat latex
the ontology of the neuter shows promise
so it seemed better to shoot poems than to write democracies
jouissance _is_ my inner-city asthma
wondering why clouds seem so up-to-date
in case of an exit, please use the nearest emergency

There was a party not far away given by the incoming editors of _Five
Fingers Review_ to say goodbye to the outgoing editors, so we cabbed over
and stood out back in the mist, and I heard lots of stories about eating
out in Iowa which I believe I'll spare you all.

The following Tuesday at Intersection was the reading for _Five Fingers
Review_ #16.  There was a great spread on tables in the back (I started
eating peanuts and just never stopped...) and Thoreau Lovell (one of the
aforementioned outgoing editors) started us off by reading from cue cards,
"Russian style".  He was followed by a first set:  Mary Margaret Sloan,
Peter Weltner, Norma Cole (playing herself and Cole Swenson), Adam
Cornford, Chris Daniels, Gabrielle Glancy, John High, Fanny Howe, and Kim
Jensen.  Some of the lines from the first set were (various authors):

that we will break the alphabet in two
drowning tangent immediate archaic
take sides into pieces
I knew I was being inconsistent, but I was beside myself
into his gaze intelligence slipped
old lizard blood combusts
the buffalo with golden horns settles on the nenuphar
a pylon of the bridge of tedium stretching from me to the Other
field upon field of uncharted disaster
I was like a cataract against the darkness of the sky
blessed is the transparent sky
today stood as cold as a mirror
it's bad poetry night at the arbitrarium

After a break to let the readers and audience (John Noto, Joseph Aukee,
Giovanni Singleton, Pat Reed, Don Hilla, Katya Olmstead and Sasha (John
High's loved ones), Jean and Ann, John High introduced the second set of
the night (using first names as opposed to Thoreau's introduction of the
first half using last names in what John dubbed "the combination of
contradictions"):  Thoreau Lovell, Scott McCleod, Michelle Murphy, Andrew
Joron, Jandy Nelson, incoming 5FR editor Jaime Robles, and Barbara Roether.
 Lines from the second half included gems like:

he thinks hard because reality is haunted, deep out into the snow
there are actual spies in this world into the dream and out again
whose arms are wide enough to keep the horizon from falling?
my tongue becomes a fuse
thought begins with the interruption of a rhythm
all the flowers in the city switched colors
years of rain fell back up into the sky
a petrified joint reminiscent of stem and branch
maybe we can find a nice animal who can help us
do you remember where I came from and have you returned to tell me?

Friday Kristin Prevallet gave a lecture and slide show on Scottish/New
York/San Francisco Renaissance poet Helen Adam, followed by a screening of
a recently restored print of Adam's long-lost film _Daydream of Darkness_
(more on Kristin later).

Saturday the 26th at New Langton Arts, Jean Day and Barrett Watten gave a
spectacular reading.  Jean read first, reading from _The Literal World_ ,
"Vernaculars of the Present:  Seven Secular Sermons", and "Narratives From
the Crib", a series written from the perspective of her 2-and-a-half-year-old:

where the world resists--pathos
westering from ruin to ruin
when the composer sees in everything the condition of flowers, the two can
seem the same
we live in an optative virtuosity
the ships, how well they sail--_in the ocean_
if you saw words in the clouds instead of numbers, you would become unesoteric
how many nights with an axe "interpolating" the forest trees?
among the sublime and lonely jets, I legislate
the milk of heaven is said to make the sun rise.

MC Kit Robinson went without pause into his intro to Barrett Watten, who
proceeded to turn his recently published _Frame_ into _Zone_, written since
his move to Michigan to teach at Wayne State.  His reading was relentlessly
thought-provoking, and I couldn't write down a lot of lines because so many
were followed by equally mind-bending lines (but here's some I did get):

dreams are our life, which we'll never be able to penetrate
everyone looks, while no one can be found
even clouds of the same sky are the same
time is a sensible by-product of motion between two poles
then we made a language out of action, but static interfered with our speech
the sky excludes landscape altogether
just as the dream fails to impose self-correction, we can only approve of
ourselves
to abandon painting, look directly at the sun

In the New Langton bleachers sat Norma Cole, Laura Moriarty, Norman
Fischer, Lyn Hejinian, Mary Burger, Pamela Lu, Rodrigo Toscano, Rob Hale,
Leslie Scalapino, Hung Tu, Kevin Killian, Steve Vincent, Larry Ochs, Etel
Adnan, Nick Robinson, George Lakoff, and Melissa.

The very next day, Sunday the 27th at Canessa Park, Michael Boughn (of
Toronto), Brian Lucas (of San Francisco) and Kristin Prevallet (of Buffalo;
told ya we'd get back to her) gave varied and captivating performances in
front of a pretty full house that included a lot of people I don't know,
but some I do, like Kevin Killian, Elizabeth Willis and Peter Gizzi, Norma
Cole, Spencer Selby, Steve Dickison and Tina Rotenberg, Charlie Palau,
Duncan McNaughton and Rob Hale.  Michael Boughn started, reading from
_Dislocations in Crystal_ and a ms. currently entitled _Enormous Bodies of
Water_.  Here's a few tidbits:

add a fourth receptor and it seems all heaven breaks loose
so maybe Einstein's got his answer now--it just keeps heading out
as if flesh were metaphor's last stand
liberates white fins to the sun
angels of evaporation
is it democracy--that weird exhalation of Detroit?
next time around, it's wind over metonymics
day's relentless stretch toward Zaire and Christmas

Brian Lucas, editor of _Angle_, read from a manuscript called _Divine Ward_:

trace a seal onto vespering glade
ever is thought of as approaching
always a valley present; a thought is a grove here
traces that, delayed, mean us
how's breathing?  did it tell you as much as you'd hoped?

and Kristin finished up with a reading which drew from _Perturbation, My
Sister_ and _Lead, Glass, and Poppy_:

shadows were collecting the evidence
they became like the window that abandons the house and joins the view
newcomers are sprayed with a lavender seal

Afterwards there was a party at Jean Day's house featuring this awesome
chili Jean made out of the Green's Cookbook and some lively conversation
about Pearlman's book on langpo, that other LP, the so-called "New York
lifestyle poets" (you know who you are), the Neo-formalists, following your
bliss--narcissistic or not?, and the metaphorical underpinnings of
mathematics.

Saving George...it's not for the faint at heart, you know.  It's not for
sissies.  But as Lincoln said at Gettysburg, we are here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us.  The last full measure of devotion,
etc.

fi is happy to announce the long awaited release of Christian B=F6k's
_Crystallography: A Report on Lucid Writing_. this creative essay on
poetics as crystals is related to B=F6k's acclaimed 1994 book of poetry,
_Crystallography_. this 36 page chapbook is a lucid essay exploring poetics
through the metaphor of crystallization. the term essay though is
misleading--this is a creative work, not an academic exercise. printed on
frosted mylar with a full colour cover & a 2X magnifying lens laid in a
pocket inside the back cover in an edition of 70 numbered & signed copies,
this hand sewn chapbook is available for only C$5.00*

fi is also pleased to re-release Alana Wilcox's first chapbook, _Analogue_.
the first edition, published only a month ago, managed to stay in print for
a mere matter of days, prompting this reprint (an unusual occurrence at
fi). this second edition of 50 sewn copies will not be in print long, & is
available for only C$2.50*

*subscribers receive 20% off this price--see the website for details


website facelift

over the last few weeks the fi website has undergone another make-over. the
new site not only includes a new interface but also expanded content. the
"in print" section now includes samples from many of the publications.
also, there are now clearer & more extensive submission guidelines.

speaking of which, since fi is back in high gear, submissions are being
actively sought. so check out the "submit" page & send in some work.


coming soon

there are a number of projects on the go, including work by Stephen Cain,
jwcurry, MAC Farrant, and a long awaited kid's book by David UU. with some
luck, these new publications will be ready by the Toronto Small Press Fair,
to be held Saturday 3 May, 11am-6pm, at Club 360, 326 Queen Street West,
Toronto. fi will be there along with many of Toronto's most interesting
mags & presses.

                    Tribe threatens mass suicide
                  By John Hiscock in Los Angeles=20

                    A TRIBE of 5,000 is threatening to commit mass suicide by leaping
                          from a cliff unless Occidental Petroleum abandons
plans
to drill for
                        oil in what the tribesmen claim is their territory.

                      The semi-nomadic U'wa tribe of Colombia is sending its
chief,
                       Roberto Cobaria, to the United States next week to
publicise the=20
                      threat and meet environmental and rights groups.=
 Legend
has it that                 a group of U'wa tribe members committed mass suicide in
the 17th
                  century in protest against Spanish colonialism.

                  The tribe's threat has become a public relations
nightmare for
                  Occidental, which says it has been deluged with letters,
faxes and
                  e-mail from around the world urging it to abandon its
drilling plans
                  for the 400,000-acre site. Dozens of demonstrators
protested at
                  Occidental's annual meeting yesterday at its offices in
Santa               Monica, California, where the issue was on the agenda.

                     "We are supporting the U'wa in their demands that
Occidental
                  promise to respect their cultural integrity and not to
drill for oil               on their ancestral land," said one of the
demonstrators, Lucy                   Braham, of Action Resource Centre of Los Angeles
which, along with                        Amazon Watch, is hosting Chief Cobaria's visit.=
 "We
need to hold US
                     corporations accountable for their actions."

                     Occidental Petroleum, which has so far invested =A38
million in the
                     site, has the support of the Colombian government and=
 is
looking to
                     government leaders to settle the issue.

                     Three Colombian cabinet ministers are to travel to the=
 U'wa
                     reservation east of the Andes Mountains next month in=
 the
hope of
                    reaching an agreeement and Occidental has said it is
awaiting some
                    signs of an accord
before proceeding.

Subject:      Rational Meaning is now out
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've just gotten a copy of Rational Meaning. I realize it is quite
expensive, but perhaps something to get from the library, or to get your
library to order. This is University of Virginia Press's catalog copy:

Rational Meaning
A New Foundation for the Definition of Words
and Supplementary Essays

Laura (Riding) Jackson and Schuyler B. Jackson

Edited by William Harmon
Introduction by Charles Bernstein

 "The publication of Rational Meaning: A New Foundation for the Definition
of Words brings to completion one of the most aesthetically and
philosophically singular projects of twentieth-century American poetry. No
North American or European poet of this century has created a body of work
that reflects more deeply on the inherent conflicts between truth telling
and the inevitable artifice of poetry than Laura (Riding) Jackson."
     --Charles Bernstein, from the introduction

Existing only in manuscript since the 1940s but enjoying an underground
reputation among friends and advocates, this primary document by one of the
most original and influential of American poets and thinkers is now being
published as Rational Meaning, Laura (Riding) Jackson's testament of the
necessity of living for truth. Begun as a dictionary and thesaurus in
the1930s, the work developed into a fundamental reevaluation of language
itself. Riding, in close collaboration with her husband, Schuyler B.
Jackson, continued this monumental project over the succeeding decades,
completing it after his death in 1968.The work, which she regarded as a
"Magna Carta of the human mind," has heretofore been seen by only a handful
of people. Yet the recent resurgence of interest in Laura Riding (1901-1991)
is nourishing the growth of scholarship and study, in whichthis culmination
of a life's work will play its part as her true significance becomes more
widely understood.

At the age of forty, having already produced a substantial and challenging
body of poetry, stories, and criticism, Laura (Riding) Jackson renounced
poetry and began to concentrate on the discovery of the principles that
embed truth and meaning in words. She believed that, if words and meaning
could be irrevocably fused, people would become "morally articulate" and
thus could never lie. This inquiry, which reaches out to include literature,
philosophy, linguistics, and lexicography, would become central to the
latter half of her long life and would finally result in Rational Meaning.
Included in this edition are essays that Riding wanted published as
supplements to Rational Meaning.

At the core of this work, which aims to restore the truth of language by
arguing that meaning inheres in words, stands the idea that a total
renovation of the knowledge of language is needed, not to develop mere
verbal sophistication and respectability but fundamentally to reinvigorate
the intellectual processes of consciousness. The book reveals the disastrous
extent to which language has been "unlearned" and shows how it may be
learned again. Rational Meaning will be essential reading, not only for
students of literature but for radical-minded linguists and lexicographers
unhappy with the orthodoxies current in their disciplines.

Among Laura (Riding) Jackson's other publications are First Awakenings: The
Early Poems of Laura (Riding) Jackson and The Word "Woman" and Other Related
Writings. Schuyler B. Jackson's writings have been published in several
magazines, including The New Republic and Time.


William Harmon, James Gordon Hanes Professor of English at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has published five volumes of poetry and
edited several anthologies, including The Oxford Book of American Light
Verse and The Top 500 Poems

Now, this was only message 1,617 of 1,667 messages on my screen -- a good
150 of which arrived over the weekend when I couldn't get to this
computer in my office -- so I can't promise that in the interval this
thread will have disappeared or metamorphized. But suffering from the
West Coast disadvantage that David Bromige mentioned last week, I do want
to jump in mention a few things about its long half-life.

David Israel (and perhaps Anne Waldman if she ever gets on) might know
more about this, but: doesn't the concept of the "Superior Man" in the
_I Ching_ come AFTER the more abstruse, knotty, entangled hexagrams that
hold no truck with individuals at all; isn't it, in fact, an invention of
Confucius' commentary? That would seem to argue, at least historically,
for the individual -- or concept of same -- rising out of the community,
in much the same way (it seems to me) that Renaissance artists only
started signing their works after the long medieval period in which there
was, effectively, no "individual" art but humans were seen as part of, not
separate from -- (a huge generalization, I know).

American law offers yet a third example, a pernicious one -- in
reconstructionist America, corporations were handed the same rights under
the 14th amendment as "persons," thus greasing the wheels for the
concentration of capital we've seen since -- one of the prime snots of
American history, Roscoe Conkling, was largely responsible for that.

These are the things that come to my mind when I think about this
question: that is, sometimes it's beneficial and a matter of the
health of a particular community not to insist, aggressively, on an
individual identity, and yet sometimes that's the only check to corporate
and/or communal mischief.

But I'd still like to know what the PURPOSE -- the FUNCTION -- of Mark
Wallace's dictum is. That is, what does it DO for you, Mark, to believe
that "there are no individuals"? Besides being the latest trendy doctrine
of cultural studies, I mean, or besides saying "It's not me, it's the
language that did it" -- (again, a simplification).

Perhaps the real answer is Aldon's (and others) humor and wit, identifying
people as "congeries of social forces" and then moving on to the next
thread . . . but still, the discourse continues, eh?

Joe

p.s. that was in 2386 B.C., in the Mediterranean, about 4 p.m., right?
on April 28th?  Over near those rocks?  Odysseus was the captain who

have kept out of this for the most part -- but most of the heat generated
around this subject has been a matter of shifting terms -- it's pretty
clear to me that Mark and some of the people responding to him simply do
not mean the same thing by the word "individual" -- I don't think there's
any doubt that discernable entities roughly bounded by their own skin
exist and move about -- but it's not just a "trendy" thing to worry that
"cogito ergo sum" has at least one or two remaining presuppostions to be
looked at --

Ron also writes on pg. 57 "Don't imitate yourself."  Which actually sits a
bit oddly next to "Individuals don't exist," as I imagine he recognized in
the writing.  Not existing is what individuals do best, no? There is a
grammatical action that can't be evaded here --

 Yes, think its the condition entered into as a result of having been
strenuously othered ('Other me, baby/All night long', et cetera) or
altered to suit (Alterity Tailors, workmanship guaranteed) sometimes
confused with altarity, the condition of having been signified,
transcendentally. Or hailed, ideologically while doubled up with
laughter.   Generally, however, alternity is preferable to '
otherness' ( which while murky is also comparatively diurnal ), for
apart from being  more syllabic  it is surely  a condition of
greater  consequence and dignity. Hope this helpless.

I'm currently temping at a big accounting firm.  My job entails  examining
a database of old accounting reference books (most five to ten years out of
date), which are in Word 1.1, looking for table and shading codes.  Eight
hours a day:  I will never say I'm bored again.  But tracing back to a
previous thread, something interesting did emerge from this boredom:  I
stumbled upon this word list of hedging products, some of which sound quite
beautiful.  For those who don't follow economic arcana, hedging products
are financial instruments designed to reduce exposure to risk, mostly in
stock, futures, and other sorts of exchanges.  Here goes:

Trillions of dollars circulate through these instruments, mostly imaginary,
unless you happen to live in Orange County.  So not only are there no
individuals, there's no money either.

what a great list of terms! Who said accountants were boring? You know,
the favorite "Boston option" of the old Celtics was their famous "break
forward."

Some day, I will make a list of all the ridiculous terms (none of which
are beautiful) which I use in my business ghostwriting.

PI/E, anybody?

cheers,
Steven

People involvement/empowerment. They're not workers or employees; they're
people. Being called a person instead of being labeled an employee must
mean I'm unique, right? A real individual. The company wants ME to be
involved and empowered. God bless them! Could I have a seat on the Board
of Directors next? I'm sure they will be happy to make room for ME and
maybe even YOU.

More 3rd thoughts on this subject.  I take it Mark W & Jeff H were making a
"writerly" statement which was meant in the context of writing [i.e.
"indiv. do not exist"]. Have been reading a really excellent study of
Aristotle by Michael Davis [_Poetics of Aristotle_], maybe can draw some
connections.  One of the zillion things Davis considers is that the _Poetics_
is a study of all human action - all action being poetic since it's both
imitative & based on mental representations ("I will do the heroic thing
here, I will do the necessary, the right, the wrong thing"..etc]. & "man"
being the rational animal, it's always a combination of action/reflection;
tragedy turns on its own interpretation of what went wrong (the reversal,
the recognition scene), which is a display of this action/reflection...
& always involves lying or fiction, as the better the imitation of real
life, the more artificial...

anyway, not to ramble too much more, this fiction-making which obscures/
displays the moment of truth brings up the issue of the author's intention,
which connects with the question of individuality.  In tragedy the author is
more "effaced" than in epic, where the writer's hand is visible in the
narration & choice of materials - it's a story as opposed to an enactment
of "real life"...

so what's the point here? Aristotle says a basic purpose of poetry is to
cause wonder, to cause the listener to wonder & consider.  Authorial intention
is obscured behind the double action/reflection of the work (just as in
real life - only in the poem or drama - there's a focus or general purpose) -
behind the lying/truth of the work.  This obscurity establishes a middle
path, a mean, between conventional "truths" (fixed shibboleths or abstract
verities) and complete chaos (the idea that since the poet is lying, there
is NO access to the truth, no authorial intention, etc. - trendy these days).
So that the audience "wonders" into a deeper exploration & sympathy for
the fatalities that emerge from this doubleness.

Again, what is ze point, Hank?  As Aldon says, there are qualifiers to
"cogito ergo sum".  M & J's "there are no individuals" rang out like
a "verity" provoking the double-dealing arguments that followed.  I would
still hold that if there's authorial intention, it's a pretty good assumption
that there are individuals.  Proust's meisterwerke destabilizes the concept
of the simple "person" (people change so much they no longer recognize
themselves) - & yet toward the end of the novel, in his defense of his
enterprise, he claims - I think - that it's the SURFACE, false social faces
of the person that are illusions - the "personalities" created by society -
& that the writer really does justice by sinking deeper into the utterly
unique experience of individual time - and only art that draws deep enough
really contributes something original & "true".  (But then, he had
his own genre & his own individual axe to grind.)
- Henry Gould

If the idea that there is no such thing as authorial intention is so
trendy, I'm not clear about why I've never actually read that anywhere or
heard anybody say it.  My understanding of the argument, dating back to
the old new critics, was that it was an argument about access to authorial
intention, about the nature of intention, an argument against allowing a
construction of an author's intention after the fact to be the limiting
horizon for all interpretations of the work, etc -- That would even seem
to be what E.D. Hirsch had in mind in his attacks on the attacks upon the
"intentional fallacy."

Likewise, I've never read anywhere that there is no access to truth -- but
have read much about the unlikelihood of an unmediated access to a
transcendent truth -- the arguments on this score always appeared to me to
concern what a truth is -- that is, whether truth is a property of
language, or whether it is something that pre-exists and persists apart
from human language --

but maybe I just don't read enough to be in on the latest trends --

they're probably not at all the latest trends - but I was referring to
deconstruction and the Yale School, which as I understand it (I could
be way wrong), holds that the text slips away from the author, cannot
refer to external reality (no such thing), & is all part of a de-Saussurean
saucer of non-identities.

Yes, it is a curious word, individual.  Since this is a poetics list, I
took the word in the context of poetry.  Henry Gould's post in which he
discusses Artistotle's Poetics is very apropos because, in terms of
writing, to invalidate the individual, however you take that
term--philosophically or historically--brings up questions of authorial
intent, etc.  To deny intention, personal engagement, or the very impulses
by which one writes seems strange to me.  Maybe that's not what Mark meant
at all.  Maybe he thinks you can engage and listen to personal impulses,
though not as an individual.  But as what?  The thing is, and this brings
me back to the context of poetry, Mark writes--indeed, many write--from the
perspective of the social.  And poetry is, by all means, partly a social
act.  But I do want to place emphasis on the word 'partial.'  Adorno traces
poetry's roots to the occult practices of the ancients.  The lyric itself
seems a to be a kind of medium through which we connect the self to the
emotional realities of others.  The social is not concerned with emotional
realities.  Negative capability is, oddly, an extremely personal exegesis
of that which exists outside of, but not dependent from, the personal.
Since most experimental poetry experiments with social forms, I'm wondering
if it's also possible for other experiments to take place under more
traditional forms.  I'm not advocating a new formalism by any means.  I'm
just interested in how something--self? individual? commuity?--invests
language with the power of expression.

The following is from Tom Clark's "Confessions."  I hate to burden the list
with so much, but Tom articulates something which is for me quite accurate.
My question is how is the individual different from self?  Or are these
terms the same?

****************


"Not knowing oneself, when all's said and done, is a little like breathing,
a habit one can give up only for a minute or two before serious
consequences start to set in.  Given that fact, imagine how uncomfortable
things might quickly get if one were able to actually see one's various
unidentical selves strutting their ridiculous pretensions to coherence
through the eyes of others.  Some levels of complication were probably
meant to be borne only by language, in whose surprising reflections and
sudden transparencies things take on for moments at a time a clarity that's
spellbinding-or perhaps more accurately spellbreaking, shattering the
data-hypnotized, stressed-out, hurry-up stupor of a life in a
technologically administered society.
        Within that society, to be oneself is almost too great a burden to
bear; even, and maybe especially, in the chilling revelation of the lyric
moment, the moment of negative capability when one's party to the
projection of a kind of self-knowledge that's not individual but
species-specific.  As deep into the substratum of a collective life the
undercurrent of our language seeps, the lyric never loses its power to
follow, tapping the convergences of all those tributary streams, drawing
off primary metaphors as trace elements from word roots.  That underground
current is the medium in which a submerged poetics can always be detected,
rising back up to the surface like air bubbles behind a swimmer in water."

I returned home from a long weekend in SF (not always poetical, though I
did get to see/hear/hang out (again in some instances) with some of the

about this & another, more traditional, event in May.

To the several comments & plugs, I'll add that the Indonesian perfomers are
also very good & that Jin Hi Kim, who has spent a lot of the last
ten-fifteen years collaborating with artists from diverse cultures (though
this may be the most elaborate project she's ever undertaken) primarily
plays komungo, IS technically a zither, though, unlike the chin, the
instrument is fretted and strummed with a stick, rather than plucked with
fingers.  She's a very good improvisor and has composed numerous works for
traditional European and Asian instruments, often playing in the same
ensembles, most of which I've heard are quite good.

Oh, & one of the musicians in Huun Huur Tu is defintely among the pictures
of performers on the card, so I assume that Gwyn's right about it being the

Subject:      REPORT CCCP 7
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The annual Cambridge Conference of Contemporary Poetry took place for the
seventh time last weekend, in England. Although I have been a silent
subscriber of the poetics list up till now, I would like to offer this
reportage of CCCP, a rather Byzantine event, yet significant in its
international scope. Other list subscribers who attended CCCP 7, such as
Ira Lightman, Fiona Templeton, Ken Edwards, John Kinsella and cris cheek,
will, I am sure, have different responses. Here are short immediate
responses on each of the readings, papers and performances I attended, in
chronological order.

Jennifer Moxley
Since Romana Huk's conference in New Hampshire, Jennifer Moxley's poetry
has become known in Cambridge. Lucy Sheerman and I (co-founders of the
small poetry press Rempress) published Moxley's pamphlet "Enlightenment
Evidence (Part One)" in November 1996. Underneath the rhetoric of studied
modesty lies, of course, a self-regarding subjectivity, yet the subtle
discursive progression through which the terms & conditions of the social
contract are negotiated, made for a fascinating reading.

John Tranter
is an influential Australian poet whose energetic interest in manifold
poetic forms is both stimulating and enjoyable. However, his reading,
interlaced with unnecessarily reductive explanations, only in part
conveyed that inventiveness. Perhaps an anxiety that social commentary
on the Australian locale would be misrecognised by the audience, weighed
unduly. The final poem, Voodoo, on the uncanniness in banal objects, was a
tour-de-force.


Papers and discussions

Steve Evans
opened the session, with a strategically surprising paper. Rather
than offering a theoretical paper, he chose to close-read Bernadette
Mayer's poem 'The Way to Keep going in Antartica'. With the elucidation of
philosophy, he followed, beautifully, the instructions in the poem: 'Look
at very small things with your eyes & stay warm'.

Karen Mac Cormack
presented a lucid analysis of the misleading readings of the
stratification of poetry communities in the States, and off-set this with
an exposition of her own methodology. If I understood correctly,
seriousness is in collaborataive praxis, not in retrospective
polemicisation of micro-political positions.

Jean Khalfa
provided an excellent short introduction to the French poet Emmanuel
Hocquard, who was to read later that evening.

Tony Lopez, who chaired the discussion, noted the similarities between
Hocquard's and Mac Cormack's working practice, and steered the discussion
toward the notion of 'communities'. Evans expanded on his paper by
discussing Mayers in relation to the New York School. Current methods of
production, distribution and communiciation (including the internet) were
discussed. Some thought this unnecessary. Moxley found it displacing
discourse (away from "creativity"). Grace Lake responded with what could
be understood as an ironic public display of "creativity". Unfamiliarity
with each other's geo-political restrictions made an in-depth discussion
difficult. Thus, we retired to the bar and continued talking in smaller
groups.

Poetry readings, again.

Grace Lake
is a Cambridge poet anthologised in Conductors of Chaos and Out of
Everywhere. Before reading, she threw a green net (of the kind one covers
strawberries with against sparrows) which she called "her internet" over
the bust of Maynard Keynes in the corner. Her imaginative gestures, the
spendthriftness of rhyme and imagery, do indeed make for a great economy
in her poetry. In the middle section (particularly 'Swiss Kiss'), however,
her reading turned into a perfunctionary litany of wrongs: the poet is
suddenly trapped in her own history. She emerged again, with a sparkling
finalale.

Karen Mac Cormack
I thought that I would have to be critically informed to appreciate the
disciplined elegance of the ellipses, turns, shifts, in Mac Cormack's
language poetry. Not so. One sequence in particular, drove language down
to vortex, and still, through & over, she continued, finishing balanced on
one point & at a slant. The Australian poet John Forbes (not known as a
language poet cognoscentus) was heard to mutter an awed 'yes'. Admirable
stuff, indeed.


Emmanuel Hocquard
is probably well-known in the States for his translations of American
poetry, and Keith and Rosemary Waldrop's translations of his. I won't
embarrass myself by presuming to comment on a poet I have not read, as I
do not read the French so fluently, but whose reading, suffice to say, I
enjoyed, not least due to Peter Riley's witty and resourceful on-the-scene
translations.

Performance

Fiona Templeton
Her peformance of 'Recognition' was extremely well-attended. The
performance seemed a continuous struggle against narrative closure, as if
refusing the fact of death itself, and yet having to come to terms (but
what terms precisely?) with this particular death: the death of a friend
with whom she had collaborated on performances. Remarkable use of modern
recording material, video and television. She would repeat the seemingly
spontaneous gestures of his recorded moving image on the shown video,
turning his play into hers (or had it been hers all along?), responding to
what seemed his direct questions to her, choosing videos to replay, in an
almost private moment, and then turn to the song of defiance, all the
while unsettling boundaries between artifice and the real. Finally, the
television set, showing a still close-up of his head on the pillow, was
heaved on to the edge of the table, and she covered the table with a white
sheet: he seemed to be present, a very thin man with a huge head
lying in a hospital bed. And clearly he was not-present. A very moving
performance, to which my too literal description does not much justice: it
could never.

Poetry

Allen Fisher
is a major English poet, and apart from his poetry's intelligence and
social grace, Fisher himself also possess these qualities. He is an
interesting performer of his poetry, at times, as if he is thinking aloud,
even ad libbing. He read a dialectical poem which was an exchange between
"two theologians": Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking. The Olsonian scale
of his projects are, to me, daunting, not only qua exegesis, but also in
their interdisciplinary scope. I take it from what I know (those 'small
things'), and then go on.


Tracy Ryan
is a young Australian poet who, together with her partner John Kinsella,
works indefatigably for the journal Salt. She is tenacious and careful
with her material, and read clear subject-poetry on domesticity, ice,
child-care. One of her poems has been chosen to be printed as a poster for
'poetry on the Underground': thousands of commuters on the London Tube
will read it daily. Closing the conference with her strong reading, was
also an acknowledgement of our responsibilities, to return to homework to
be done.

Take care now, and mind the gap.

That is exactly it, exactly why I will do anything for Rachel, and
conversely, why I felt so betrayed by Maria, who turned her back when I
showed where I was bleeding. Turned her back (here is the worst part) and
continued reading a poem by David Bromige!

evidently the term "boston marriage" was a phrase in the gay/lesbian
underground argot ca. 1950s or so to refer to a living arrangement in which
two women were nominally "roommates" and may have actually never been
sexual partners but were for all intents and purposes, a (closeted) couple.
maybe i've got some of the details wrong.

ah yes, here's one other, now remembered:

>a Philadelphia lawyer

(I knew this was percolating -- for some reason, Maria D.'s mention of "a
Boston marriage" dislodged it) -- only trouble is, I can't give a very exact
definition; it was prob. William Safire who did a riff on this.  (The sense,
I think, suggests sleaze -- for reasons not lost to memory.)

I recall laboring out an explanation of "a New York minute" to someone
who didn't understand the phrase.  (Much like "explaining a joke.")

Of course, location needn't be strictly physical or strictly geography.
How about cyberspace?

what, for example, would be:

>a Poetics epoch?
[i.e., lasts abt. 4 days ?]

>a listserv season ?
[i.e., lasts abt. 3 days?]

then there's the gentle art of euphamism, such as:

[i.e., when, for some seemingly innocuous remark, one is royally flamed,
skewered, and hung out to dry ?]

i believe Boston marriage actually goes back to the 19th century, picked up
again later in this century as a term of empowerment (i.e. "queer").  i
would go with Rich's analysis on this one, that it's more complex than
sexuality (genital per say) alone can indicate-- as us queers are usually
only defined by the sex thang, and think of the term as another facet of
the lesbian continuum (or was that the Q continuum???) but you've all read
the essay...

With a couple triple snap downs I'll toss the legendary California Stop
into this discussion, which is what you do when you're driving and instead
of actually stopping at a light or stop sign, merely slow down.  I don't
know if this a western US regional thing or if it's a little more
widespread.

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through
values or sentiments, in _one_ time, in _one_ history, in
_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality
and encouraging him to offer it as an example or impose
it as a conquering assertion. -- Maurice Blanchot

Books & Co., long one of Manhattan's best poetry/philosophy/critical
writing bookstores, is slated to close May 31. The following message from
Paul Auster is posted in the window:"For twenty years, Books & Co. has
been a sanctuary for readers and writers, a spiritual home for everyone
who still believes in the importance of words. New York has been blessed
to have this store, and the thought that it may be forced to close has
filled me with sorrow. I feel like someone who has just been told that one
of his dearest friends is dying.Does money always have to have the last
word? Can a squabble over a few pennies actually shut down a place that
has meant so much to our city? Don't the people bent on destroying this
landmark realize the damage they will be doing? Subtract Books & Co. from
New York, and New York loses part of its soul."(signed) Paul Auster

From Tracy Ryan, who's semi-attached (or semi-detached) to
this list by virtue of "domesticity":

Just a plea for attention to the "bigger things" as well as
the small; while I appreciate Karlien's amiable comments, I
should point out that as final reader at the Cambridge
Conference of Contemporary Poetry I read sixteen poems, two
of which mentioned children (& not child care???) and none
of which were "domestic", except insofar as one of them
mentioned "writing at the kitchen table"--a poem which was
a meditation on the way space behaves when the human body/
psyche is in isolation (a person whose house has suddenly
become vacant continues to write in the one habitual spot).
I am baffled by the description of my work as "clear subject
poetry" on domesticity & child care. Perhaps this was some
kind of slippage?--since I dedicated one poem to John Kinsella
mentioning that he wasn't there because he was at home minding
our child. Ironic that even when your "domestic" situation
is supportive in a feminist sense, you get patriarchal [?]
cliches in the public arena--& from another woman?

There's a danger in assuming that because one can immediately
apprehend some of the content of a poem it is "clear subject
poetry" unaware of its own process or of the often opaque
habits of language. And when it isn't opaque for me, it's
wrapping itself around & into visual art, landscape, clay,
leeches, bees, French translations, trompe l'oeil table-tops,
solstices, and internal organs. These were the "subjects"
of what I read. Were we at the same reading???

A final note: the Australian poet John Forbes may not
qualify for that awesome title of "language poet cognoscentus"
but he's very discriminating in his use of "Yes!" and we
Australians are more used to him satirising than being
satirised [however affectionately]. Perhaps as he sat and
listened to the clear and the unclear he was thinking, as in
his "Love Poem" ("about"! the Gulf War?)

         ...I watch the west
do what the west does best

& know, obscurely, as I go to bed
all this is being staged for me.

---------------------------------
Well, a first posting may as well be a long one.

I missed the Poetry & the Public Sphere conference in New Brunswick the other
day. It interferred with the start of the mini-T-ball season and having been
away from my family for the two previous weekends, couldn't imagine a third.
But other than a couple of brief oral reports from Bob Perelman and Charles
Alexander (which came at Eli Goldblatt's house just two blocks from the site
of the so-called summit on volunteerism ((which got more play in the media
than did the poetry & the public sphere))), I've heard nought of said
conference. Can somebody do the same sort of detailed account that we have now
had of the Cambridge Conference?

Alterity, by the way, teaches at UC Berkeley.

A word here to note the passing of composer of Robert Erickson (1917-97) after
having been bed-ridden for the past 15 years. Erickson was one of those
American originals who seemed drawn to the West Coast. One of the first music
directors of KPFA in Berkeley and a founder of the music dept at UC San Diego.
Charles Shere wrote an excellent bio/study of Erickson that came out a year or
two ago (and I believe is still carried by Small Press Distribution in
Berkeley) that also contains a CD of the music.

There was an obit in yesterday's NY Times that was fairly decent, especially
by the sometimes spotty standard of that publication.

Stories I have yet to relate to the list.

Buying Miles a drink when I was 15
(he was wearing a gorgeous pigskin overcoat over a raglan-shouldered
houndstooth suit -- he looked like the devil's reply to Charlie Chaplin)

Meeting Ali in '95
His suit was covered with stars; he passed me a two-page tract in Arabic
crushed in the form of his hands' lost control.

Meeting Colin Powell in '96
We discussed old Volvos. He drives (daily) a '66 122S wagon, green.

My date with Jessica Lang
(she lived on the rue des Rosiers; she stood me up)

...I better stop while you're ahead.

Subject:      colloquium

there follows a plain text version of the prepatory bulletin on the sub
voicive colloquium - this is published in Sub Voicive Poetry 1997 number 9
alongside a chunk of texts by Karen MacCormack - and is being mailed out in
UK - it will be on the Mainstream web site too within days. Apologies for
cross posting

Lawrence Upton

Preparatory Bulletin Sub Voicive Colloquium 1997

CONVENOR:
Lawrence Upton

COLLOQUIUM COMMITTTEE:
Ken Edwards, Allen Fisher, Robert Hampson, Lawrence Upton

Preparatory Bulletin: April 1997

DATE:
The Sub Voicive Colloquium 1997 will take place during the autumn of 1997
at a date to be announced. It will be a Saturday event with a poetry
reading on the Friday night before.

PLACE:
Centre for English Studies, Senate House, University of London.

APPROACH:
There is too much to cover in one colloquium, but we can cover a lot; it is
as important to be sure we listen to each other as it is to try to get
through too crowded an agenda. It is important that all at the conference
work to provide real opportunities to really TALK. (The convenor is
committed holding another colloquium in 1998 and perhaps annually
thereafter if it seems useful to do so.) The day will be structured and
sessions will be chaired. However, we are not necessarily looking for
formal papers to be formally delivered. Rather we are looking for
activities which will initiate discussion in the colloquium and proposals
for possible further action; such activities may well include the
presentation of formal papers

AIMS:
to address issues of importance which have emerged from discussions and
activities of working poets in the British Isles:

PROPOSED AREAS OF DISCUSSION:
What constitutes or why bother to care about
* progress
* progressive
* innovative
* inventive
Why trouble over paradigms at all
The term "linguistically innovative", first used by Gilbert Adair, is now
used very widely and quite loosely. Does it have any meaning now? Is it a
useful term to be using?
Does the term "experimental" have any role?
Visual poetry / concrete poetry: Is it being unfairly marginalised these
days? has it had its day or is its day still to come? or is all the energy
going into 'performance writing' these days?
The relationship of poetry to other areas, in particular "performance", to
what extent is poetry now separable as a discrete activity
To what extent do we mean different things when we speak of the following
and how useful are these terms in defining differences:
* Poetry
* text
* writing
How does electronic text relate / fit in?

CONFERENCE MATERIALS:
Finances permitting, there will be background materials of some kind;
understanding of what is needed will grow as ideas and proposals become
full plans. It is intended that, where appropriate, papers / prepared
documents will be published in their colloquium or post colloquium form
after the colloquium. It is intended to audio record the proceedings; but
the recordings will not be released without relevant permission being
granted.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
There is no agenda with regard to who leads discussions EXCEPT that it is
desirable for the final list to be SURPRISING in a constructive way and it
shouldn't be an all-male thing or anything like.)

Further proposals in the areas outlined above are requested. Please state
topics / areas in as much detail as possible together with how you want to
do it, how long you want to do it for. NB We may have to limit the amount
of time you take.

DEADLINE  for receipt of proposals:
to be announced - keep sending them in.

PROPOSED DEADLINE  for materials to be included in background materials:
to be announced

Materials to be reproduced are requested in hard copy and computer file.

FINANCES:
At this moment there is no money and everything is being done on various
people's goodwill. We welcome donations in money and kind! Other forms of
finance will be sought but you must be prepared to be working for nothing
and travelling for nothing

There will be a fee to attend the colloquium. This will be kept as low as
possible. A combined (cheaper) ticket to the colloquium and poetry
performance will be available

Please use email wherever possible because it is not only fast but cheap.
Please send s.a.e. / i.r.c. when using the mail.

PROMOTING THE COLLOQUIUM:
Please tell people and / or pass us the addresses of people who might be

Tom Mandel appears to have ALL the good stories. But I could - if I wanted -
tell you about the time I tooled around LA in a pickup truck with Sinead
O'Connor riding shotgun.

Then there was the time  - less elevating to be sure - that I watched Rodney
Dangerfield consume an Arby's beef sandwich. Samuel Johnson has nothing on
that guy!

Stories I have yet to relate to the list.

Buying Miles a drink when I was 15
(he was wearing a gorgeous pigskin overcoat over a raglan-shouldered
houndstooth suit -- he looked like the devil's reply to Charlie Chaplin)

Meeting Ali in '95
His suit was covered with stars; he passed me a two-page tract in Arabic
crushed in the form of his hands' lost control.

Meeting Colin Powell in '96
We discussed old Volvos. He drives (daily) a '66 122S wagon, green.

My date with Jessica Lang
(she lived on the rue des Rosiers; she stood me up)

...I better stop while you're ahead.

It has come to my attn that there has appeared, as of this month,
Vol. 1, No. 1 of a new (evidently academic) journal:
    International Journal of Hindu Studies

They have a website:
    http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/gthursby/ijhs/contents.htm

but the articles themselves don't appaer on the site.  However, they
are putting abstracts of the articles on the site.

The 1st abstract from the 1st issue seems of potential interest to
Poetics denizens, ergo I reproduce that here:

/ / / / /

      The center and circumference of silence: Yoga, poststructuralism, and
      the rhetoric of paradox
       by George Kalamaras

   Some recent studies of Hindu yoga have tended to ignore the
   dialogical aspect of this philosophy and, thus, its compatibility
   with poststructuralist theory and poetics. This paper focuses on
   paradox as sacred experience, arguing that the reciprocal paradigm
   of yogic meditative philosophy is a dialogical system capable of
   accommodating paradox and recasting it as a generative condition.
   Yogic philosophy thus offers an epistemology compatible with that
   of radical poetics, one that can ultimately enrich
   poststructuralist poetics in ways truer to their radical intent.

[author of the above]:
          GEORGE KALAMARAS
          Associate Professor of English and Director of Creative
          Writing at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne

I've not seen the Journal itself (nor read the essay described
above).

"paradox as sacred experience" --
a phrase to conjure with (as they say) --

Jeffrey:

For the best explanation of "Alterity" as relating to otherness, check out
Emmanuel Levinas's _Totality and Infinity_.  In this book, he uses alterity
to distinguish his use of the Other from that of a dialectical relationship
of self and other.  Instead of otherness being that against which the
subject defines itself, "Alterity" for Levinas signifies that the Other is
not a construct of the cognition of the subject.  Instead, the Other is
beyond reason and even beyond Being and transcends any idea the subject can
have of the Other.  Hope that helps.  I'm doing a project relating this
idea of alterity to poetry.  Back channel me if you want more info.

              "Howl," an Allen Ginsberg opus that has drawn censors' attention
              ever since it was first publicly spoken four decades ago,
              has gotten a Cleveland talk-show host kicked off the air.
              Cleveland's WERE-AM pulled the plug on The Gilly Show after an
              eight-minute reading of the poem's opening stanzas early Monday
              morning.  Phil Ferrante, the show's producer,
              said that the station's action came as a surprise,
              considering that the poem was read just before 2 a.m.,
              well into what the FCC deems "Safe Harbor" for material that
              might be considered indecent. "We even talked about [the FCC Safe

              we talked about Ginsberg and free speech and told everyone all
              night that we'd be reading it on the air."  Like most of the
              station's non-syndicated content,
              The Gilly Show was among WERE's 88 hours of brokered programming
              - radio talk for pay-to-play broadcast time. A few local bars and
              nightclubs sponsored the show to help it break even,
              and despite its status as a brokered program,
              it was rated the Number One show on the station by Arbitron
              during the last ratings period, Ferrante said.  John Hill,
              WERE station and program manager, said that the show's host,
              who goes only by the name of Gilly,
              knew the rules.  "Everyone who starts a brokered show goes
              through a one-hour indoctrination of what can and can't be done
              on the air," he said. "We have a very liberal list of rules and
              regulations that we ask [the brokered shows] to follow - you have
              to do this when dealing with amateurs."  The topic of last
              Sunday's show had been the radio free-speech issues as well as a
              tribute to Ginsberg,
              who died earlier this month.  There were plenty of
              listener-discretion warnings throughout the show, said Gilly,

Thanks, Karlien, for that careful and attentive description of the
Cambridge Conference of Contemporary Poetry. I was going to attempt one of
my own, but my take on what went on is not so very different, so I'll
abandon it. Except to add my tuppen'orth on the one session she missed out
which I was at, the Saturday morning one: Pierre-Yves Soucy and Staffan
Soderblum. The former a Belgian-based French-Canadian, the latter from
Sweden, and both previously unknown to me. Soucy's poems were long, dense,
abstract, knotted, and possessed of an uncanny momentum. This meant that
Ian Patterson's skilful translations had to wait a while to be heard, but
the alternative - to interrupt the sequences - would have been untenable.
Soderblum, was lighter, his poems shorter, but with a resonance that
followed hard behind them: language leaving its traces, animal footprints
in the snow. He prefaced the reading with some words on the translation
process. Rod Mengham read English translations, including one of his own,
having no Swedish - this exercise amused Soderblum.

Last night (Tuesday) Karen Mac Cormack gave another tour de force reading
at SubVoicive, the Three Cups, London, this time duetting with Alan Halsey
on a collaborative piece which kind of zinged. Hope to see it in print
soon.

I'm curious.  What is "the dilemma of using 'otherness'" and why does it
need to be gotten out of?

Ric Caddel posted the following to the brit&rish list, but I thought it
would interest a number of you here in the US. This is indeed an
indespendable infotool for anyone who wants to know what's happening
across the big A. My only query being that odd date "1977"-- I take it
to be a typo -- Pierre

The new ed. of the Association of Little Presses' CATALOGUE OF LITTLE
PRESS BOOKS IN PRINT (No.14, 1977) is now out. It costs 3 pounds 75, and
is available from ALP Co-ordinator Chris Jones, 111 Banbury Rd Oxford
OX2
6JX.

It's an invaluable resource: list of UK little presses, access point for
work by numerous UK authors (including members of this list!), bookshops
(many of which do mail order) and - of course - individual press
adverts.
As well as pointing out new things which I'd never have heard of, it
reminded me of a lot of blasts from the past, things I want to dig out
and
re-read. And some really weird stuff too. New readers, start here - with
caution...

Kalamaras has an interesting essay on poetry & mysticism in the current
(a recent?) issue of Ed Foster's TALISMAN. Worth reading & arguying

We are <italic>beginning </italic>to put up all the LINEbreak poetry
radio shows in Real Audio on the EPC. LINEbreak is a series of about 30
shows, produced by Martin Spinelli, which I host. The shows have both
conversations and readings.


As of now, we have RealAudio only for Lyn Hejinian, Loss Glazier & Ken
Sherwood, Ted Pearson, and Carla Harryman. (The other shows on the site
are in .mpeg and .wav formats, which take time to load before playing.)
More will be put up week by week. (You can also get all the shows on
cassette.)


RealAudio (or Real) Players are available free. They let you listen to
the show in real time in low fidelity. Information about this is on the
site.
