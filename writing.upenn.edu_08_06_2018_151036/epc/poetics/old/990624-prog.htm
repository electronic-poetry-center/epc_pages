<H1>Poetics at Buffalo</H1>
<h3>from the Archives: June 1999 version of the Poetics Program flier.</h3>
<hr>

<H2>Faculty</H2>

The Poetics Program, Department of English, SUNY-Buffalo was
founded in 1991 by five literary artists affiliated with the English
Department -- <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein">Charles
Bernstein</A>, <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/creeley">Robert
Creeley</A>, Raymond Federman, <A HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/howe">Susan Howe</A>, and Dennis Tedlock -- in
cooperation with Robert Bertholf, the Curator of the Poetry/Rare Books
Collection.  In 1995, the faculty expanded to include, from English,
Joseph Conte, Art Efron, Jill Robbins, and Neil Schmitz;
from Comparative Literature, Henry Sussman; from Modern Languages and
Literature, Gerard Bucher and <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/guitart">Jorge Guitart</A>;
from Anthropology, Barbara Tedlock; and from American Studies,
Lawrence Chisolm.  <P>


<H2>Program</H2>

The Poetics Program has an interdisciplinary approach to
literary, cultural, and textual studies.  Our programs include: <P>

<EM>Visiting Writer Residencies</EM>.  
<A HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/calendar">

and Michel Deguy. <P>

<EM>Poetry/Rare Books Collection</EM>.  The <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/libraries/units/pl">Poetry/Rare
Books</A>Collection has one of North America's most extensive holdings
of twentieth-century poetry books and manuscripts and continues to
acquire archives from innovative contemporary poets.  Each year, a few
graduate students have the opportunity to work in the Collection,
placements that are integral to the goals of the Poetics Program. <P>

<EM>Graduate Seminars</EM>.  The essence of the Poetics Program is the
series of interrelated <A HREF="../../documents/syllabi.html">graduate seminars</A> offered by the faculty in
such areas as ethnopoetics and native American verbal arts; the
European tradition from Mallarme' to present; twentieth-century
English-language poetry and poetics, with emphasis on the radical
modernist approaches and the relation of poetry to the other arts; the
American traditions of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
century; twentieth- century innovative prose, fiction, and surfiction;
philosophy, ideology, and literature; poststructuralist approaches to
poetry, philosophy, linguistics, and ethics; poetics and/as cultural
studies; language and performance (including visual and concrete
poetries, as well as sound and performance poetries); the poetics of
prose; and "core poetics"--a history of poetics from the pre-Socratics
to the present (including the philosophy of language and related work
in linguistics). <P>

<EM>Publications</EM>.  The Poetics Program, in conjunction with other
funding sources, supports a large number of magazines and presses,
which are independently edited by Program participants.  These
publications include poetry magazines, chapbook series, critical
anthologies, broadsides, and newsletters. <P>

<EM>The Art of Nonfiction Writing</EM>.  Through a series of prose
writing workshops and individual consultations, the Poetics Program
provides support for investigating and developing new approaches to
critical writing.  By emphasizing the importance of the mode and style
of all types of writing, the program encourages -- and supports --
students in writing essays and dissertations in creative, exploratory,
dialogic, and self-constructed forms. <P>

<EM>The Poetics of Translation</EM>.  Many of the programs in poetics
emphasize an experience of the verbal arts of languages other than
English, both in terms of the sound and music of other languages as
well as considering a variety of approaches to translating from these
languages in, to, and around English: translation as a poetic
process. <P>

<EM>The Art of Teaching</EM>.  Through its various offerings, the
Poetics Program emphasizes teaching of the arts at the college level,
with special emphasis on how to teach innovative works of literary
arts to undergraduates. <P>

<EM>Individual Consultation</EM>.  Faculty members are available for
individual consultation on course selection, oral examinations,
dissertation topics, and all aspects of writing and poetics. <P>

<EM>Electronic and Media Resources</EM>.  The Poetics Program has a
strong presence on the internet through the Electronic Poetry Center
(<A HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc"><I>EPC</I></A>), directed by
University at Buffalo Libraries Web Manager <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/glazier">Loss Pequen~o
Glazier</A>.  The EPC features <A
HREF="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/rift"><I>RIF/T</I></A>, its own
electronic poetry journal; small press information and on-line texts;
and archives of our international discussion group; the Poetics
listserv.  The Program also sponsors <A
HREF="../../linebreak"><I>Linebreak</I></A>, a
weekly radio program aired locally and nationally.  Festivals and
Conferences.  The Poetics Program sponsors both student-and
faculty-initiated conferences and festivals.  Such events have
included "Writing from the New Coast," a milestone gathering of newly
publishing poets from across North America; "The New Gothic," readings
and discussion with Kathy Acker, Peter Straub, Bradford Morrow, Paul
West, and others; "Samuel Beckett Conference"; and the "Festival of
French Poetry." <P>

<EM>Reading Workshops</EM>.  UB undergraduates participate in the
Poetics Program through "reading workshops" featuring class visits and
readings by visiting poets and writers and interactive and creative
responses to assigned readings in modern and contemporary poetry and
fiction. <P>


<H2>Philosophies</H2>

While poetics suggests a long history of laws of composition, the
Poetics Program stresses poiesis -- the actual making or doing: poetry
as process.  Every doing carries the potential of something new,
emergent, something not already predicated by poetics.  Practice
overtakes theory, practice changes theory.  And not just writing
practice, but performance practice, the practice of sound. <P>

To write is to produce meaning and not reproduce a pre-existing
meaning.  To write is to progress and not remain subjected (by habits
or reflexes) to the meaning that supposedly precedes language.  To
write is always first to rewrite, and to rewrite does not mean to
revert to a previous form of writing, no more than an anteriority of
speech, or of presence, or of meaning.  The book creates meaning, and
meaning creates life (and not vice versa).  Fiction or poetry is never
about something, it is something.  Writing is not the living
repetition of life.  The author is that which gives the disquieting
language of fiction or poetry its unities and disunities, its knot of
coherence and chaos, its insertion into the real.  All reading is done
haphazardly.  Now some people might say the situation (of poetry and
fiction) is not very encouraging but one must reply that it is not
meant to encourage those who say that! <P>

Poetics is "an unruly, multisubjective activity"; the reading of
poetry, just as the writing of poetry, is beyond the control of any
authority.  Poetics opens the space of a page to interplay and
contradiction, to many voices, a complexity of words.  A poet brushes
scraps of themes against the continuum of history.  Language surrounds
chaos.  Poetry brings similitude and representation to configurations
waiting from forever to be spoken.  A poet is writing from inside the
opening where the writing subject disappeared without writing.  The
search for traces is a polyphony of stories. <P>

Ethnopoetics is not simply the poetics of exotic others but calls
attention to the ethnicity -- the particularity and
nongeneralizability -- of all poetic practices.  Oral poetry is best
thought of as something not older than or prior to or simpler than the
written, but as something that goes on coexisting with, and
interacting with, the written.  Thus, our attention is to alphabetic
and nonalphabetic writing, to codes of the historical past and
imaginary codes of a potential present. <P>

Poetics stays grounded in the fact of making, the complex of that
which has so made such "it," inside and out, the intimately present
(oneself, like they say), else the vastness of all possible dimension.
"To measure is all we know..."  Such reference proposes world in all
its times and places, in determined labors of common body, constructs
of passage and echo.  "Only the imagination is real..."  (As in New
England--to work...) <P>


<H2>Participating Faculty</H2>

The Poetics Program is one of several special programs and centers
sponsored by the Graduate Program in English at UB.  There are no
individual degree requirements for these programs, which are open to
all enrolled students.  The existence of the Poetics Program is a
testament to the active involvement of practicing literary artists in
the teaching of poetics and critical theory in the graduate program.
Our approach to ‘poetics‘ resonates with the orientation of many
of our colleagues in literary and cultural studies at UB.  The Poetics
Program is dependent on the active participation, through seminars,
co-sponsorship of visiting writers, as well as through orals and
dissertation committees, of a significant number of critics and
scholars in the English Department and Comparative Literature Program,
as well as in the faculty of related fields such as Modern Languages
and Literatures, Art History, American Studies, Philosophy, Classics,
and Media Studies. <P>


<H2>Core Funding</H2>

Core funding for the Poetics Program comes from the Samuel P. Capen
Chair of Poetry and the Humanities (Robert Creeley), the Melodia
E. Jones Chair in French, Department of Modern Languages and
Literatures (Raymond Federman), the David Gray Chair of Poetry and
Letters, Department of English (Charles Bernstein), and the James
H. McNulty Chair, Department of English (Dennis Tedlock), as well as
from the Department of English.


<H2>Admission</H2>

The Poetics Program is an integral part of the graduate program in
English at the University at Buffalo, with special affiliation with
the Program in Comparative Literature and the Poetry Collection. <P>

Any graduate student in Arts and Letters at UB can participate in
Poetics seminars and special programs.  Applicants applying for
admission to the Ph.D.  or M.A. program in English should contact the
Director of Graduate Admissions, Department of English, 306 Clemens
