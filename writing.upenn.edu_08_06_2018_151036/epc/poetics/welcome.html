1. Posting to the
List</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">
Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations
of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms
and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,
untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. <i>While we
recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and
respect our decision to operate a moderated list. </i>The Poetics
List exists to support and encourage divergent points of view
on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics,
and we are committed to doing what is necessary to preserve this
space for such dialog.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The Poetics List is a moderated
list. Posts are limited to list subscribers. All messages  are
reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the list
as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please note that this list
is primarily concerned with discussions of poetry and poetics.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including
web links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading
series, and blogs that they have coordinated, edited or published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
(print or digital) are always welcome.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Poetics List is not a forum for
a general discussion of poetry or for the exchange of poems. Queres
for contact info, messages intended for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages,
and free-standing personal poems or journal entries will, in
general, not be forwarded to the list.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Also, please note that the Poetics List
is not a "chat" list and we discourage the posting of&nbsp; very
short messages intended for only a few subscribers. Personal
queries and off-topic submissions will not be posted.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Send messages directly to the list address:
poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><br>
        2. About the Poetics List</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Above the world-weary horizons <br>
New obstacles for exchange arise <br>
Or unfold, <br>
O ye postmasters!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics
Listserv was founded by Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in
its fourth incarnation, the list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide.
We also have a substantial number of nonsubscribing readers,
who access the list through our web site (see archive URL above).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Due to the high number of subscribers,
we no longer maintain the open format with which the list began
(at under 100 subscribers).  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please also note that this is a not
a general interest poetry list and information about this list
should not be posted to directories of&nbsp; poetry lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific engagement
related to the list's stated orientation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In addition to being archived through
the <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/epc">EPC</a> and at the <a href="http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html">UB
Listerv archive</a>, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews,
obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Note also that Roof Books published
Joel Kuszai's edited collection of the Poetics List; this is
available from<a href="http://www.roofbooks.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=93780100631100"> ROOF </a>and
also <a href="../presses/roof/index.html">online at

<p><font color="#000000"><b>3. Subscriptions</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">*For all subscription requests go to http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">*To subscribe for the first time
click on &quot;Subscribe 
        (join) a List.&quot; Immediately following your subscription
to the poetics listserv we ask that you email us at poetics.list
--at -- gmail.com, subject-line &quot;registration,&quot; 
  with your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number.  Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic  deletion from the subscription roll.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">*To manage your subscription (for descriptions 
        of the different subscription options please see section 3), click on 
        &quot;Subscriber's Corner.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, 
        but formal registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions, 
        whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should 
        be addressed to this same administrative address.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information 
        and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">All posts to the list must provide
your full real  name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy
between your full name  as it appears in the &quot;from&quot; line
of the message header, please  sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full  name with each post
will be unsubscribed frorm the list.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The most frequent problem with subscriptions is 
        bounced messages. If your system is often down or if you have a low disk 
        quota, Poetics messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription 
        being automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically 
        generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely 
        bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same 
        process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the future: 
        set your list options to &quot;no-mail&quot; and read the list on the 
        web.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><b>4. Subscription Options</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">We encourage you to alter your subscription options 
        via the link on the right side of the screen at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. 
        If you would prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; 
        the following commands:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu 
        this one-line message with no &quot;subject&quot;: sub poetics [your Firstname 
        and Lastname]</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our 
        web interface and not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining 
        subscribed to the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line 
        message to &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; with no &quot;subject&quot;: 
        set poetics nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension 
        of email service.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; 
        this one-line message with no &quot;subject&quot;: set poetics mail</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">* to receive the list in digest form (you will 
        receive the day's individual posts in one email sent just after midnight 
        EST), send &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; this one-line message 
        with no &quot;subject&quot;: set poetics digest</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">*to receive posts in the default option (you will 
        receive individual postings immediately), send &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; 
        this one- line message with no &quot;subject&quot;: set poetics nodigest</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">* to receive the list in index form (you will receive 
        a list, without the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each 
        day along with the author's name and address and the number of lines it 
        comprises; you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either 
        plain text or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; 
        this one-line message with no &quot;subject&quot;: set poetics nohtml 
        index --or-- set poetics html index</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription 
        in default or digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended 
        period of time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics 
        messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription 
        to &quot;nomail&quot; as recommended above.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><b>5. To Unsubscribe</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription 
        options), again, we strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side 
        of the screen at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html 
        You may also may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to &lt;listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu&gt; 
        with no &quot;subject&quot;: unsub poetics</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please 
        note: sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system 
        administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages to 
        Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail 
        from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, 
        then resubscribe with your new email address.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><b>6. Cautions</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In moderating this list, the
editors must consider sometimes competing interests. The basis
for our decisions, however, rests with our collective judgment
about the kind of space we want for the list. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">All posts not only go out to list
subscribers but also become a public part of the list archive
on the web. Note that posting to the list is a form of publication
and that by sending your message to the list you formally consent
to such web publication. Posts are currently being indexed by
search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to remove
posts from the list archive or to control search engine indexing
of these posts. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">For reasons of basic security, we
do not allow pseudonymous subscriptions. All messages intended
for the Poetics List should be sent in Text-Only format, without
attachments. We do not accept HTML-formatted messages or attached
files. As a general rule, keep individual posts to 1,000 words
or less.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please do not publish list postings
without the express permission of the author. Posting on the
list is a form of publication. Copyright for all material posted
on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and
its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by &quot;fair use&quot; of
published materials.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">All material on the Poetics List remains
the property of the authors; before you reproduce this material,
in whole or in part, we ask that you get permission (by email
is fine) from the authors. If they give permission, then we ask
only that you say that the post or posts appeared originally
on the Poetics List (http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/welcome.html)
on [give date and say:] Used by permission of the author. </font></p>
<p><font color="#333333">Note: Private</font> <font color="#333333">correspondence
via email and letters are always &copy; the author and may not
 be reproduced in whole or in part without the written permission
of the author. As a general rule, we will not publish posts that
include such material unless they indicate that permission has
been given.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We request that posters limit the number
of posts they send to the list on any given day.  Given
that our goal is a manageable list (manageable both for moderators
and subscribers), the list accepts 75 or fewer messages per day,
though these paramenters may be changed at the discretion of
the list moderator. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Like all systems, the listserv
will sometimes be  down: if you feel your message has been delayed
or lost, *please wait  at least one day to see if it shows up*,
then check the archive to be  sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem,  you may wish to
contact the editors at &lt;poetics.list@gmail.com&gt;.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>7. Flaming</b><br>
&quot;Flame&quot; messages will not be tolerated on the
Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes
racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which
the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one
of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a
critique
or criticism of the person.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>June 2008: Refocussed List Policy</b><br>
  In line with our  editorial focus, we do not automatically
post submissions but select those we think are most useful for
sustaining this online community. We appreciate all submissions,
but will be more selective in what we choose to post. Queries
for contact info, messages intended for just a few subscribers,
messages that are not on topic, "flame" messages,
and free-standing personal poems or journal entries will, in
general, not be forwarded to the list.<br>
