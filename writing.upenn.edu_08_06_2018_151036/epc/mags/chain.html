<b><font size=+1>Chain 1: "Special Topic: Gender and Editing"</b></font> (282 p.)<br>
Edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr 
Appears annually
$7.95
6x9, 288 pages
issn: 1076-0520
isbn: 0-922668-12-4
Publication date: October 1, 1994

<blockquote>This first issue explores its editors' apprehension about editing. It
attempts to create a dialogic space through its investigation of the
(im)possibility of an unmediated reception and the (im)possibility of
detaching a writing from its presentational/ideological form.<p>

<I>Chain 1</I> begins with a forum on how and why journals are created and in
what ways questions of gender have informed those decisions. As such
it investigates the implications behind making taste public and the
manner in which taste presents itself in the public sphere. This
section includes an interview between Dodie Bellamy (of Mirage) and
Andrea Juno (of REsearch) on Angry Women and "sex positive" editing
practices; Dubravka Djuric (of Mental Space) on editing in communist
and post-communist societies; Heather Findlay (of On Our Backs) on
collaborative editing; Susan Gevirtz (of HOW(ever)) reading editing as
medical diagnosis; Holly Laird (of Tulsa Studies in Women's Litera-
ture) on the difficulties and rewards of editing feminist journals in
the academy as well as pieces from a number of small press and
feminist editors.<p>

Instead of a collection that claims over and over the ability of the
editor to know and define,<I>Chain</I> is a journal that claims instead
"this made itself and here is what it's made of; it is just part of
what continues." In order to facilitate a journal that could make
itself,<I>Chain</I> used the model of the chain letter. A number of writers
from the U.S., Canada, and England were asked to send a piece of
writing to another writer. These writers responded by writing a poem
and then send ing both poems onto a third participant, and so
forth. This section includes work by Abigail Child, Gail Scott, Norma
Cole, Sianne Ngai, Kate Rushin, Fiona Templeton and others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second issue of <I>Chain</I> questions the supposed neutrality/
objectivity of documentary forms. The concerns of this issue are: in
what ways does the topical world filter through language? how do
creative forms actually capture an event, a person, a place? The work
included highlights the way we use language/image to cut up our
experiential encounters so as to (re)see them.<br>
