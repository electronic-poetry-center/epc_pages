    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The ancient world balanced on the
    back of <BR>
    turtles has a way of catching up with us in the <BR>
    netherlands surrounding sleep where we are partly <BR>
    stone and partly turned to smoke. The mown grass <BR>
    moves beneath the still dog so that she seems to be <BR>
    running along the blurred wall in the background. When <BR>
    we say we are sleeping we refer only to the bodies we <BR>
    wag in the daytime while our minds have their ears pinned <BR>
    back into past lives where fleas and fleeing first began to <BR>
    separate. Pulling a sled into the northwest corner of<BR>
    your couch I return to the vomit of the age that forms the prevailing<BR>
    ambiance of this one. A continual approach of skaters moves<BR>
    like a chorus on a China-plated lake toward the day<BR>
    when modernity itself will freeze over.<BR>
