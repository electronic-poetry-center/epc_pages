    <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Seven Questions for UNTITLED's
    editors Leonard Brink and Jono Schneider:<BR>
<BR>
    1) What is so exciting about prose poetry? Why start a prose
    poetry<BR>
    magazine?<BR>
    </FONT></B><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    Leonard:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Why start a literary magazine of
    any kind if not to promote and to provide<BR>
    a forum for the kind of work one likes? I edited a magazine previously,<BR>
    Inscape, that was much more eclectic. This time around I wanted
    something<BR>
    more focused and that occupied a more definite space. If you're
    going to<BR>
    advocate something it helps to take a stand that's articulate
    enough to<BR>
    make sense to a readership that you're asking to subscribe to
    multiple issues.<BR>
    I don't mean the kind of articulation that occurs in manifestos,
    literary<BR>
    theory, or &quot;poetics&quot; as such -- somehow Jono and I
    were able to agree on a<BR>
    place to stand and we hope that the poems we publish articulate
    that<BR>
    aesthetic.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I like the dissolution of the line.
    The line is what makes poetry, on<BR>
    the immediate surface, look like, or appear to be, poetry. And
    I'm excited by<BR>
    the surprise that happens in prose that goes against the look
    of prose. But this<BR>
    prose doesn't have to be &quot;poetry&quot; -- think of Beckett
    here, or Leslie<BR>
    Scalapino's novels, like Orion or The Front Matter, Dead Souls.<BR>
    Because prose is the default medium for writing, we have an unconscious<BR>
    default mechanism for reading it, even if we know enough to separate
    genres<BR>
    through what we expect them to do for us as readers. But there
    is no<BR>
    expectation for prose poetry, I think, until the reading has
    begun - that's when the<BR>
    expectation begins to form. Or at least in the aesthetic we want
    to promote,<BR>
    which would be a writing that turns at every corner, even when
    the corner is<BR>
    the narrative thread that the writing is turning against.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    <B>2) Do you care to comment on the history of experimental prose?
    Is all<BR>
    writing experimental? If you see the term &quot;experimental&quot;
    in three<BR>
    sentences in a row, as you have just now, does it make you faintly
    sick? And if<BR>
    so, why?<BR>
<BR>
    </B><I>Leonard:</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We're kind of partial to the term
    &quot;abstract,&quot; which is to say that<BR>
    representational or narrative work doesn't turn us on too often
    -- I'd<BR>
    rather go to the movies. Still, &quot;experimental&quot; is probably
    a more useful<BR>
    term to describe the work we're interested in than &quot;avant
    garde.&quot;</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I think the work of the modernists
    relative to prose -- Stein, Williams'<BR>
    Kora in Hell, even Nietzsche -- has a lot for us in the way of
    style that I want<BR>
    the magazine to continue out into the future, to see how writing
    can keep<BR>
    becoming new in some unseen form, even if that form looks like
    paragraph<BR>
    blocks on a page. And language writers - Hejinian, Pereleman,
    Seaton - have<BR>
    a lot for us. And the French New Novelists - Robbe-Grillet, Duras,
    Simon,<BR>
    Sarraute. And Peter Handke and Edmond Jabes, and Maurice Blanchot.<BR>
    These writers in particular - some of my personal favorites,
    though not<BR>
    necessarily Leonard's - have presented challenges to the field
    of writing,<BR>
    through style, through the question of who is speaking, through
    the<BR>
    challenge to structure and form. So I think the alteration of
    the novel from the<BR>
    &quot;external&quot; world -- where things are happening -- to
    the internal world that<BR>
    doubts itself -- where I don't know what's happening, but I think
    it's<BR>
    happening to me, if I even exist - is a way of thinking across
    this history,<BR>
    is a record of this history. That is, the map of the history
    of writing<BR>
    leads to the writer in the room spilling words onto pages, and
    these words point<BR>
    out at the world, make a point of the world.<BR>
    I don't worry about &quot;experimental&quot; in any other way
    than if I read<BR>
    something that shows me something that I haven't seen about writing
    and the<BR>
    art of prose. An experiment, as I see it, is something that is
    still<BR>
    happening, that the writer is opening up through form.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Leonard:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I would also count Blanchot and
    Jabes among my personal favorites. As to <BR>
    experimentation, there's nothing new under the sun. There are
    things <BR>
    that stand in contrast to expectations. I think of John Ashbery
    as a prose poet.<BR>
    The French surrealists, too, had no argument with normative syntax.
    Rosmarie<BR>
    Waldrop's trilogy is as good as anything that's ever been written
    in prose, and<BR>
    her translations of Edmond Jabes are classic. I think of J.H.
    Prynne as a prose<BR>
    poet. We're about to publish a book by Beth Anderson, who refuses
    the prose-<BR>
    poet label...<BR>
    </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    <B>3) Untitled has a wonderful energy and flamboyance, do you
    care to<BR>
    comment on this? How does this observation strike you?<BR>
<BR>
    </B><I>Jono:</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Thanks! I mean, you can blame it's
    success on the writers in Issue #1,<BR>
    who made it relatively easy to assemble a packet of energy. But
    I also think<BR>
    this speaks to the fact that a mag of lesser known ideas on prose
    has a lot<BR>
    to offer to the world of writing.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    <B>4) Do you care to chime in on the Tosa Motokiyu / Araki Yasusada
    Letters<BR>
    and the scandal / debate about the appropriateness of such writing?<BR>
<BR>
    </B><I>Leonard:</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Unlike some of the magazines that
    published parts of this body of work<BR>
    previously, we went into it with our eyes open. It takes a certain
    amount<BR>
    of virtuosity to write that affectedly and that's what most intrigued
    me<BR>
    about the work. Once it's done poisoning the arts, political
    correctness will be<BR>
    the death of our culture. It's already permeated the academic
    community<BR>
    that has all but copyrighted the term &quot;avant garde,&quot;
    and ruined it for<BR>
    everybody. In any case, I like the challenge to the idea of authorship
    that the<BR>
    Yasusada work presents. There will be more work in our second
    issue that<BR>
    worries at that. Also, we've invited an Asian-American writer
    who expressed<BR>
    an interest to give us something that counters the Yasusada work.</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    Kent Johnson has a wonderful sense of humor. The letters raise
    lots of<BR>
    interesting questions about authorship, about identity, and about
    the<BR>
    territorialism of writing. This is a problem, I think. That we
    can determine who<BR>
    has the right to speak about anything, in any form. Speech and
    writing are<BR>
    eerily bound to nothing other than the desire to say something
    right for the<BR>
    speaker, regardless of the world, even if the speaker does not
    know the world.<BR>
    We have to have faith that the speaker does know the world. And
    if s/he does<BR>
    not, we can choose to reply for the world we know to be true.
    That's all. But I<BR>
    also think the writing stands apart from this. It's funny, it's
    bizarre, it's<BR>
    touching, it's interesting. And when we first accepted it, I
    was totally ignorant<BR>
    of the scandal. --<BR>
    </FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Leonard:</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">
    I didn't know that.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">--And the writing, when I read it,
    returns me to that same state, where there is<BR>
    only the scandal of reading.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    <B>5) Is there anything about publishing Untitled you've found
    surprising?<BR>
<BR>
    </B><I>Leonard:</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I'm surprised that at the moment
    there aren't more journals of<BR>
    prose-poetry.</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    We've received a lot of work that uses narrative as its primary
    force, as<BR>
    if writing a short story too short to be called a story makes
    the writing a<BR>
    poem.<BR>
    I like narrative - I'm not against it in the experimental sense.
    But I<BR>
    want something more difficult in terms of what I'm holding in
    my hands,<BR>
    trying to get at with my eyes. So I'm surprised that narrative
    is seen so<BR>
    easily. I think narrative is a much more concerted effort, a
    fight for a<BR>
    story, rather than a thread we can always pick up.</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Leonard:</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    Yes, an awful lot of the work we receive for the magazine is
    narrative,<BR>
    much of which is overwrought short-short stories. I guess the
    people who<BR>
    write this stuff think that the quality of being short and overwrought
    makes<BR>
    it poetry. We reject it, but then we don't claim to have cornered
    the market<BR>
    on what people might call prose poetry.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    <B>6) What do you think of the web as a way of getting poetry
    journals out<BR>
    amongst the people? How do you distribute Untitled? How has the
    response<BR>
    been? Do you plan to branch out at all? Publish books?<BR>
<BR>
    </B><I>Leonard:</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The web is a great way to get poetry
    out to people. I'm surprised that<BR>
    web-based journals have not done better, but a lot of good writers
    won't<BR>
    give their work to them. I mentioned Inscape before. The production
    values<BR>
    of this magazine were identical to a series of chapbooks I curated
    at the<BR>
    time and I found it difficult to get work from some writers who
    seemed to<BR>
    prefer the sort of perfect bound journals that resembled commercial<BR>
    products of mass reproduction even if they had a fraction of
    the circulation. As<BR>
    bizarre and hypocritical as that seemed I wanted Untitled to
    offer the<BR>
    physical forum that writers preferred. The response to Untitled
    has been<BR>
    great. I know of poetry magazines that have been around for a
    lot longer<BR>
    that don't have as many subscribers as our first issue has provoked.
    Of<BR>
    course if a big response were our goal we'd publish the collected
    works of<BR>
    Leonardo di Caprio.<BR>
    We HAVE branched out into book publishing. We're co-editors,
    with Beth<BR>
    Anderson, of Instance Press and have recently published a wonderful
    book<BR>
    by Keith Waldrop, called Haunt.<BR>
    </FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">7) Is there anything we should
    know about Untitled? or anything you<BR>
    think we haven't covered that you would like to comment on?</FONT></B></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I'd just like to add that I love
    doing this - helping assemble something<BR>
    that I find of interest. I also like combining known and lesser-known
    writers, because when the<BR>
    writing's there, the name seems to fade a bit, while the work
    itself remains<BR>
    in the foreground.</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Leonard:</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I'll second that. We've rejected
    the lesser work that some &quot;name&quot; writers<BR>
    have sent us in favor of better work by people who have never
    been published<BR>
    before. Some of these better known and more frequently published
    writers are<BR>
    friends, and people I respect very much, and whose work I usually
    like, but<BR>
    in the end a magazine will prove to be worth its salt, or not,
    based on its<BR>
    editorial decisions. Popularity and commercial success aren't
    normally<BR>
    associated with poetry anyway, so as long as we can afford to
    make the<BR>
    magazine a work of art/a reflection of our own aesthetic we'll
    do that<BR>
    rather than sell-out to collecting name-brand poets, including
    those that<BR>
    are merely the flavor-of-the-month in a passing clique.</FONT></P>
