      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I hope these posts stand on their
      own. They were written for a mailing list, <BR>
      without the intention of publication or further consideration
      outside the <BR>
      particular context in which they were written.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">When Kent Johnson submitted his
      Lacan dialogues to VeRT, he also <BR>
      submitted, without permission and in violation of copyright,
      a selection of <BR>
      emails from British-poets members to this magazine. British Poets
      members <BR>
      objected because the emails were presented as if they were a
      fair <BR>
      representation of what had been originally written, when in fact
      many of <BR>
      them had been greatly altered, sometimes to mean the exact opposite
      of <BR>
      what had been originally said. The editors assert that &quot;the
      posts had, indeed, <BR>
      been edited-- though not materially changed&quot;: this is in
      fact not true. Each <BR>
      one of my own posts either been misleadingly cut, or had been
      rewritten, or <BR>
      had parts added which I did not write. I hope this comparison
      makes clear <BR>
      how they were changed, and for what reason.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I was angered by these changes,
      which seemed to me extraordinarily <BR>
      dishonest and, to say the least, self-aggrandising. I still fail
      to see the <BR>
      relevance of publishing the British Poets posts to the original
      work: despite <BR>
      all Kent's claims, the Lacan dialogues created no especial scandal,
      apart <BR>
      from boring a number of people witless by turning up as regularly
      as spam. I <BR>
      have no doubt they are better served by being published in their
      current <BR>
      form, where they can be accessed voluntarily by those interested.<BR>
      The editors have agreed to publish the original and altered emails
      side by <BR>
      side, so that anyone interested in this minor spat can make up
      their own <BR>
      minds.<BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">A poem is a place within language
      where the other may exist, however <BR>
      tremblingly, in the meeting place which the poem may reveal in
      its gaps <BR>
      and silences, which are charged and made potent by the energies
      of the <BR>
      language itself. Therefore erotic and dynamic, and resisting
<BR>
      commodification. Therefore at a distance from pornography, in
      which <BR>
      nothing may possibly exist except the desires of the pornographer,
      in <BR>
      which, as I said, the other (reader, involuntary character, whatever)
      is <BR>
      completely erased, in which desire is static and unchanging;
      and which <BR>
      desire is so neatly commodified these days and so entrenched
      in the mores <BR>
      of capitalism I fail to see how anything can be made of it as
      a beacon of <BR>
      freedom or rebellion. Just a deadening and self-mortifying obedience.

      The orgasm as tiny spasm, the present reduced to the endlessly

      of us consider why we value this list, and one of its values
      (to me) is <BR>
      in fact its openness, which has been created by a certain ethos
      of <BR>
      self-responsibility (that boring, dull virtue) among list members.
      (A <BR>
      friend of mine who runs a shelter for abused children has signs
      all over <BR>
      the place which say NO RIGHTS WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITIES). I feel
      that <BR>
      would be compromised by some of David's suggestions. I do think
      that's <BR>
      the easy way out; I would feel something was lost if suddenly
      we were <BR>
      hedged about with all sorts of legislations. But I do understand,
