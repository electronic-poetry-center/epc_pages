    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">This trapping of heavier objects
    &quot;moving them upward when one<BR>
    would expect them to fall down, the same is true for particles<BR>
    that tend to move randomly within cells; can be captured,<BR>
    ratcheted, perform useful work, made safe&quot; safe in its choices.<BR>
    Not wrecked, tired. Of the technical language, the<BR>
    topographical information from ground and air surveys, from<BR>
    radar data gathered by aircraft and space satellites, maps<BR>
    showing the elevations and depths of the surface, black and<BR>
    white images of the planet unobscured by clouds, fog or<BR>
    darkness.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The world is a lot more complex
    than that. The lumps, the<BR>
    chart, the fraud of language, those fakers, it is equivalent,
    is<BR>
    a satellite, knocked out/off say skewed, say the months were<BR>
    minor virtues. Lurid, why bother? Sinking, into the knee<BR>
    kingdom, praying there, I can find you. I know where to find<BR>
    you. There are all sorts of levels. There's so much noise in<BR>
    the data. To fly the radar equipment and mast again, or knowing<BR>
    your enemies, each one of them. Decided it was a good idea to<BR>
    preserve the past, to keep the capability to bring the past in.
<BR>
    Like they say there is no neighborhood [up here], just a number<BR>
    of houses.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Attached another meaning to it.
    Of a time when we were close we<BR>
    looked upon a model of the world. The Amber Room, the one that<BR>
    was lost so long ago. Once it was beautiful, but even before
    it<BR>
    was stolen, it was in poor shape, in need of restoration, the<BR>
    pieces were falling out. The outcome has been curiously<BR>
    appropriate, such is the will of God, a symbol of the huge loss,<BR>
    of perhaps unwilling to dwell. One long vertical panel is<BR>
    finished, as well as the lower perimeter along the floor; we<BR>
    stayed up and talked of snow.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">From the first, we felt the most
    interesting expression of faith<BR>
    was a test. An underlying somewhere, underneath, in the dirt<BR>
    and salt of it, the rounded smooth, the scatterings, all of<BR>
    them. This is a way. Luminous monochrome paintings on shaped<BR>
    aluminum. Lacquered industrial finishes, no trace of the hand.
<BR>
    Stitching them together, keeping them close. Logs to burn;<BR>
    sending the ghosts of these buildings heavenward, where they<BR>
    belong. Its vast contributions, it's warmer, more vulnerable,<BR>
    more interesting, drumming that threads together a little more<BR>
    faith and the shabby state, a mysterious song, with handcrafted<BR>
    defects all over it. A long version of empathy. About as a<BR>
    word you keep hearing all the words you keep out. The main<BR>
    evidence soars freely atop the music, drifting into range from<BR>
    the world below.</FONT></P>
