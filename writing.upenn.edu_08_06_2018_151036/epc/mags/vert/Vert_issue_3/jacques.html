    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">On or around the 20th of February,
    I was sent, by Jacques-Alain Miller (who, <BR>
    I should say, rarely engages with electronic mail), a series
    of <BR>
    &quot;psychoanalytic&quot; exchanges between three so-called
    &quot;Jacques&quot;: the famed <BR>
    Jacques Lacan; his almost equally-famous disciple Jacques-Alain
    Miller; and <BR>
    a clinical patient Jacques Debrot, a fairly obscure and obviously
    brilliant <BR>
    American poet and doctoral student at Harvard University (whose
    very <BR>
    institutional name functions as a kind of Law in the cultural
    unconscious of <BR>
    at least five-hundred million people across this <BR>
    soon-to-be-hit-by-a-giant-asteroid planet that we inhabit). In
    a separate <BR>
    mailing I received the final letter of March 1, whose current
    date, I note, <BR>
    has for some reason been altered from an original postmark of
    a few days <BR>
    previous. Whether this is a slip being corrected or a new slip
    being made, I <BR>
    am not sure. In any case, the matter may be of no importance
    whatsoever.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I am unsure as to the origin of
    these writings, and --like the British-Poets <BR>
    Listserv, which would appear to have had a rare form of *panicosis
<BR>
    colectividae* in reaction to them-- I am equally unsure of their
    true <BR>
    purposes, though the triple name flakes-off as if from archetypal
    flint <BR>
    (albeit not Jungian, heaven forbid) a bizarre form of pure poetry,
    a <BR>
    Sokalian hoax-thrust under the guise of an-as-yet-unclassified
    expression of <BR>
    hysteria, which may be read, in fact, as unconscious homage (whomever
    the <BR>
    Authors may be) to the dead Father, Lacan. I have my crime-suspicions,
    of <BR>
    course, and they are legion.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Nor can I say, with absolute certainty,
    if the exchange is the work of one, <BR>
    two, or many, even though the epistles forwarded to me carried
    the address <BR>
    headings of one &quot;Kent Johnson&quot; and one &quot;Jacques
    Debrot,&quot; neither of which <BR>
    name had previous familiarity to me, as they did not to anyone
    else on the <BR>
    editorial board of *<A HREF="http://www.lacan.com/covers.htm">lacanian
    ink</A>*</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">All things considered, it seems
    clear that this dream-like repartee has, at <BR>
    the very least, the participation of Jacques-Alain Miller, my
    friend and <BR>
    former psychoanalyst. I say this hesitatingly, but with a good
    deal of <BR>
    pride: The inimitable style is there, here and there, if one
    parses the odd <BR>
    syntax. And there is, too, an extended subliminal slippage (even
    at <BR>
    phonemic-pun levels), between Lacanian theoretical/clinical matter
    and <BR>
    &quot;obvious&quot; dilletantish garbage, for the &quot;correspondence&quot;
    to be anything but <BR>
    the brain-child of someone deeply-in-the-know. Thus, I say, going
    out, <BR>
    perhaps on a ceibo limb, that Jacques-Alain Miller is the primary
    author of <BR>
    these psychoanalytic exchanges... I am in awe, if a bit befuddled
    at the <BR>
    same time. And so I can offer little more, I fear (besides my
    happy pleasure <BR>
    at this blue-bolted jouissance), than the most banal, genetic
    speculation.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">But the way we speculate about the
    unknown (Das Unbewusste, as Alain Miller <BR>
    draws from Freud in a letter to Debrot) will tell us in itself
    much about <BR>
    the structures and patterns of the psyche, about its limitations
    and <BR>
    prejudices, about its paradoxical claims to science even as it
    is impelled <BR>
    by the neurotic desires of the aesthetic.</FONT></P>

    it all for others to analyze.</FONT></P>

    IN CORRESPONDENCE<BR>
    --between Jacques Debrot, Jacques Lacan, and Jacques Alain-Miller</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">########################</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">[from Jacques Debrot]</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques Lacan (professor of
    my dreams):</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">For instance, will you believe me,
    I have a strange feeling reading your<BR>
    books with 90 percent weightless love--but moreover--with confused
    boredom <BR>
    and inner noise.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Who, or what is it, then, that is
    reading? Once I was a girl banging my<BR>
    head against the cold, tiled floor of a truck stop MEN'S ROOM.
    I died when <BR>
    I was nine; my hands--their smell is not human. Perhaps I've
    made you <BR>
    curious? Touching myself yesterday in red bathwater I realized
    I don't have <BR>
    normal thoughts. My mind moved my hand. I am trash.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jacques Lacan, if the word &quot;YES,&quot;
    is still floating in inky water in the<BR>
    Magic 8 Ball, what word is missing when language itself has been
    exhausted?</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">PS: I was in mom's and dad's room.
    Nobody could look at me steaming away <BR>
    in their bed like fresh shit. The big secret of psychoanalysis
    is that <BR>
    there is no sexual act, all there is is sexuality.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">February 12, 2:39 PM</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">My Dear Jacques Debrot,</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Ah, yes, you have the Name of The
    Father. And it is funny that you dreamed <BR>
    of the steaming shit in your parents' bed. The same thing, but
    not a dream, <BR>
    did take place to me in 1953, when following the famous riot
    at the <BR>
    conference of the International Psycho-Analytical Association,
    I retired to <BR>
    my bed room in the third arrondisement. Imagine the horror and
    shock. Ah, <BR>
    but I rolled in it, and that is the secret; it was the sleep
    of a King. The <BR>
    next day, the Societe francais de psychanalytique was conceived,
    and, later <BR>
    that year, I delivered, very much a la *delires a deux* (but
    don't let the <BR>
    cat out of the bag, my sweet Jacques), The Discourse of Rome.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Now, let me say one thing, which
    is most clear from your letter. You are <BR>
    seriously &quot;fucked up,&quot; as the Americans say. And I
    should like to see you in <BR>
    my office. There is much about which we might talk. Though, if
    you wish, we <BR>
    may write. Language is like a dream. Who knows what might happen?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I saw your clue. I bite my thumb,
    waiting in my famous photograph.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques Lacan:</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I dreamt a snake had copulated with
    itself, falling asleep as icewater and <BR>
    coming to term in the body temperature of its own anus--new born,<BR>
    adult--human-faced and snake-bodied. It shot up a tree and dangled
    there in <BR>
    the exact position of a caduceus which is also a Borromean knot.</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">PS: Today a mistake in arithmetic
    led me to ingest 4 rather than the 2 red <BR>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques Debrot,</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">It will take some time to untie
    you. First you must recognize the difference <BR>
    between the &quot;I&quot; who speaks and the idealized ego that
    is projected (as you <BR>
    are doing with your invented, listserved dream) onto the analyst.
    You see, <BR>
    the source of your letter (in the multiple senses of this word)
    is your <BR>
    profoundly narcissistic desire for a certain omnipotence. What
    you will <BR>
    find, as we proceed --and if you are brave-- is the *real remainder*
<BR>
    existing beyond the symbolic order of your speech, which, presently,
    in its <BR>
    serpentine psychosis, wears the doubled face of your Father and
    of me, <BR>
    Jacques Lacan.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We have much to say to each other.
    This session is now over, abruptly. And <BR>
    trust me, I know what I'm doing, no less than does Bertolt Brecht.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">As if in earphones I can hear you
    thinking. But your soul has no windows by <BR>
    which anything can come in or go out. Am I listening, then, only
    to your <BR>
    body? On a narrow bed from which we've just gotten up, a fat
    maggot is <BR>
    writhing on the spot where you were lying. Kissing you I'm filled
    with the <BR>
    stench coming out of your mouth. Close-up, the rain--we,re standing
    in <BR>
    headlights in a forest clearing--opens the wounds on your face
    like fruit.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">PS: In my dream I,m the blacked-out-girl
    lying at the bottom of a hole<BR>
    letting the dirt fall in my open eyes. The snake dangling from
    the tree<BR>
    above me is biting its tail now: it makes eternity. In this way,
    Jacques <BR>
    Lacan, I am all of my ages every second.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">[Firstly, please excuse the broken
    lines which make the letter seem like a <BR>
    poem. At the moment, my machine is not functioning with normalcy.]</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Of course, you are not aware of
    all the paragrams in your writing.<BR>
    It would,<BR>
    and will, startle you when the time comes to reveal them, but
    do not<BR>
    be<BR>
    afraid; it is all science in the end. Thus the infinite snake
    is<BR>
    bashed<BR>
    against a rock: You separate.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Here is a good example of my certainty,
    alluding to the above: the<BR>

    Structuralism (and thus of all the *Ecrits* through the *Encore*),<BR>
    Ferdinand</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">de Sausurre, spent his last syphilitic
    years discovering anagrams<BR>
    and<BR>
    paragrams in ancient Saturnalian verse (in fact, to give you

    Hollander, this is the very maggot<BR>
    you are<BR>

    your unconscious is, like that of all human beings, an ancient<BR>
    cesspool))<BR>
    suppositoried ghost of the Course in General Linguistics). This
    last<BR>
    awkward<BR>
    and knotted sentence is typical of my style, especially in my
    late<BR>
    works,<BR>
    but the main point, young Jacques, is that before Saussure you
    might<BR>
    have<BR>
    been burned at the stake like a phallused witch. So, at the risk
    of<BR>
    reinforcing your already accelerated need to identify me as the<BR>

    thank your lucky stars that you have contacted my orffice.</FONT></P>

    (a <BR>
    nothing, yet a nothing that is precisely not nothing, that is
    a kind of call <BR>
    to being) introduces a decisive break at the level of immanence,

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">To illustrate with a story: Have

    Well, when I was a young psychiatrist in Paris, when the City
    was innocent <BR>
    yet, the man-boy Artaud was a patient under my care. It was a
    difficult case <BR>
    (imagine treating a patient who has written on the walls in his
    own shit, <BR>
    &quot;People who come out of nowhere to try to put into words
    any part of what <BR>
    goes on in their minds are pigs.&quot;): In the end, electro-shock
    was the only <BR>
    way in. He was blue and stiff as a kite in a Chinese wind. &quot;He
    is LIKE A <BR>
    GOD!&quot; screamed Dali in Spanish, standing behind me, his
    bony fingers <BR>
    clutching my hips, while Michaux, in turn, clutched those of
    him clutching <BR>
    mine (we had, the three of us, with our respective disciples,
    only just that <BR>
    week severed resolutely with the execrable Breton) and were inseperable,
<BR>
    like peas in a pod... Yes, it was as if he, Artuad, were (oh,
    his <BR>
    gauze-filled mouth) a kilometer up in the air, attached to a
    taut and <BR>
    humming string, and we holding fast to him.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">My Dear Jacques Debrot,</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Thank you for your most recent epistle.
    I shall take it with me for analysis <BR>
    to Corsica tomorrow, where I am slated to deliver an address
    on &quot;Freud, the <BR>
    Phallus, and Death.&quot; (Ho-hum) After my lecture, I hope to
    wander around the <BR>
    beautiful island a bit, to enjoy a bit of sand, sun, and the
    famous <BR>
    &quot;cannabis corsicana&quot;-- but this last information is
    strictly under oru <BR>
    doctor-patient confidentiality. Okay? (Whisper into the ear-rudder
    of yoru <BR>
    sarcophagus boat: Would you like me to fold you some in my next
    letter?)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I shall be gone a fortnight, and
    I have confidently entrusted your care <BR>
    during my brief absentia to my Son-in-Law, Jacques-Alain Miller.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">(Isn't it funny that his name is
    Jacques, too? Jacques, Jacques, Jacques. <BR>
    Jacques this and Jacques that! Jacques the jack-off boy and Jacques
    the <BR>
    jack-in-the-box! Jacques be nimble and Jacques be prick!<BR>
    Ha! Ha! Ha!)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I want you to listen very carefully
    to my Son-in-Law and to do exactly as he <BR>
    commands. His style will be different from mine, yes, to be sure,
    but this <BR>
    shall be a freshening change for you. Be very brave, and I will
    write to you <BR>
    when I return.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">So: My Son-in Law Jacques will write
    you, Jacques, in two days time. While <BR>
    you wait, I would like you to study the essay entitled &quot;Two
    Aspects of <BR>
    Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances.&quot; It is by
    my old bon vivant <BR>
    friend Roman Jakobson. You can find it in a book titled *Fundamentals
    of <BR>
    Language*, which is no doubt contained in the collections of
    the Harvard <BR>
    University library.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Until soon, my friend.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques Debrot:</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">This is Jacques Alain-Miller. Surprise.
    I did not have to wait two days. As <BR>
    my Father-in-Law once famously said: &quot;The fun is now over.&quot;<BR>
    Look at me: I am not smiling.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Let me say this: I have reviewed
    your case and I want to be up front about <BR>
    everything. So: I don't like you. In fact, I think you are a
    filthy, <BR>
    worthless American maggot. I've seen your type until I want to
    puke all over <BR>
    my wife. Piece of Oscar Wilde excrement. Swinburnian swine. Do
    you know <BR>
    about beef jerky? Of course you do-- you're a fucking asshole
    American with <BR>
    a funny name. I speak of the beef jerky that is long like a coiled
    snake or <BR>
    a constricted feces. Do you know what I would like to do? I would
    like to <BR>
    wrap the beef jerky around your neck four times and then place
    one of the <BR>
    remainder-ends in your mouth and the other remainder-end in your
    unwiped <BR>
    asshole. Then I would like to piss and shit all over you because
    that is <BR>
    what you deserve, you worthless sick Harvard boy. Fuck you! Do
    you think I <BR>
    am kidding? I am sick and tired of inferior-gened Spanish-Americans
    with <BR>
    fake French names wasting my clinical time. Piece of fucking
    shit ass. Look <BR>
    at me. Open your mouth. Now say fuck me. Now say fuck me Language
    poetry. <BR>
    Rectal tube. Shit-finger.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Now take the jerky out of yoru asshole
    and chew on it very slowly. Prick. <BR>
    You make me laugh like a hyena.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Oh, and if you are thinking of telling
    my Father-in-Law on me, I would <BR>
    remind you: How could you ever prove it? This is Hotmail, fuck-face.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Father-in-Law Jacques:</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The below letter to Mnsr. Jacques
    Debrot has, as another did for you some <BR>
    weeks back, been returned under the stamp DECEASED. After resending,
    it was <BR>
    returned again, with the same stamp, only, this time-- in letters
    collaged <BR>
    and pasted from different magazine pages-- with the additional
    word <BR>
    PURLOINED beneath the stamp. It seems clear that the analysand
    has cut-off <BR>
    all communication, though it is possible that he is showing resistance
<BR>
    merely to my person and is in waiting for your return from Corsica.
    But my <BR>
    fear is that we have lost him, despite the radical measures.
    I hope you are <BR>
    not disappointed. I tried my best to follow your daring instructions
    down to <BR>
    the very letter.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I send this for your records. I
    hope you are enjoying the much deserved <BR>
    vacation, and I eagerly await your return.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Your Son-in-Law,</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">February 20, 11:27 AM</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques Debrot:</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">In your shock, now, which faces
    me, listen attentively: This Wasp you have <BR>
    seen is a kind of pulsating waterworks, a miniature hydraulic
    Das <BR>
    Unbewusste, a sign of your central, originating lack or Hole,
    that which is <BR>
    the very structure of structure (including, by the way, even
    of all the <BR>
    mathematical grammar of your passe dissertation advisor, Professor
    Chomsky).</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">To be direct, if at the risk of
    losing a certain poetic suggestiveness which <BR>
    theory affords, enveloping, as it does, in its vaginal folds,
    all the <BR>
    inferior and culturally constructed &quot;hard&quot; sciences:
    1) The Wasp is your <BR>
    Father, the Law, holding the Cutlass Shears; 2) The Plate on
    which this Wasp <BR>
    pulses and buzzes its wings is the bar dividing two Realms (the
    Barrier of <BR>
    Repression, as my own Father-in-Law has called it); 3) The Wardrobe
    hides <BR>
    that which no sign can reach; 4) The Real is the Witch behind
    the Wardrobe; <BR>
    5) The Witch has a beard.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">(SCARY, YES, BUT STOP CRYING IN
    YOUR CRIB, YOU LITTLE TURD OF FLESH, SO<BR>
    YOUR PARENTS CAN GET ON WITH THEIR DEATH-UNION.)<BR>
    </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Now: the key is that you not be
    afraid. And exactly what you hold, though <BR>
    you do not yet know it, is the Key: You must turn it, like breaking
    a neck, <BR>
    in your Mother's Bearded Iris Cunt. It's all very natural and
    &quot;normale&quot; as I <BR>
    say to my 18 year-old students at the Ecole. Just do it.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Furthermore, I want you to look
    at me now as I say this and to be very <BR>
    respectful as you do so. Stick out your tongue: What are these
    radical, <BR>
    asyndetic marks, this look, left to right, like reading:</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&quot;a &quot;book &quot;then &quot;an
    &quot;ashtray &quot;then &quot;a &quot;cigarette--&quot;the &quot;tip
    &quot;is <BR>
    &quot;stained &quot;with &quot;my &quot;lipstick--&quot;then
    &quot;a &quot;window &quot; then &quot;a &quot;cloud <BR>
    &quot;then &quot;a &quot;tree</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Listen attentively: They are precisely
    that which is expelled or jetted out <BR>
    by the lack or Hole, like a spiral galaxy turned on its side,
    shooting <BR>
    matter doubly out of the disk in violent, horizontal plume, far,
    far into <BR>
    unimaginable space, where no symbols of language exist, no poems,
    no music <BR>
    of any kind. Only blank space. Metaphor tries to deny it. It
    is your gift <BR>
    and curse, Jacques, that you are breaking through the great falsity
    of <BR>
    Poetry.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Desire, you see, is always the jetted,
    the displaced, reappearing, always <BR>
    and plasmatic, in another guise, another jissum, because Light
    and Time <BR>
    demand it. (This, by the way, is why your famous dissertation
    adviser is <BR>
    full of the most pathetic shit. It is also why Poets in cyberspace
    are truly <BR>
    in Hell, spewing their venom at that which frightens them, that
    which is <BR>
    nothing more than the 0 and the 1.)<BR>
    And this is why my Father-in-Law had requested you to read his
    former <BR>
    leathered lover, Jakobson. When you write me back, I want you
    to tell me <BR>
    why. Do not think for a minute, Harvard boy, that you can fuck
    with me.</FONT></P>
