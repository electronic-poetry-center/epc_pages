           &gt;&gt; cred there, and I've found no evidence of any hierarchy

           mailing lists do tend to be dominated by consensus. so do realms
          such<BR>
           as &quot;poetry&quot;. british-poets is a place where the two
          come together in a<BR>
           very powerful way. britain is a small place and not surprisingly
          many<BR>
           brit-po list-members have experience of the same networks -
          print mags,<BR>
           venues, etc, etc. [i opted out of that system in the late 60's.]<BR>
           <BR>
           as malcolm says, those who want to speak, speak. and if they
          say the<BR>
           right things they are welcome and may post as much or as little
          as they<BR>
           wish, and if they say the wrong things they are ignored, or
          attacked.<BR>
           that's just opinion, i hear you say, sour grapes, something
          like that.<BR>
           what would constitute proof?<BR>
           <BR>
           as kent says, read the archives.<BR>
           <BR>
           when i discovered british-poets list the first thing which came
          to mind<BR>
           was a gathering of people who would welcome another poet as
          a brother.<BR>
           how stupid of me. i soon realized that consensus policed the
          list in an<BR>
           ugly, snobbish manner. my experience of &quot;british&quot;-poets
          [and the name is<BR>
           significant] is that the agenda of the consensus is to promote
          certain<BR>
           poetries and suppress others. read the archives.<BR>
           <BR>
           generally, i feel that we are experiencing something which is
          a natural<BR>
           consequence of global networking/communication. people whose
          elitism is<BR>
           based on control of &quot;local&quot; networks, hierarchies,
          suddenly find<BR>
           themselves on a mailing list with international subscribers
          - do they<BR>
           ever stop to think that their actions may be transparent? one
          would<BR>
           imagine that the presence of &quot;the archives&quot; would
          make them think more<BR>
           carefully but for some reason it doesn't happen.<BR>
           <BR>
           kent will be one of the few to emerge from these &quot;affairs&quot;
          with any<BR>
           dignity, i believe.<BR>
           <BR>
           &gt;&gt; In addition, these high-up-in-the-hierarchy subscribers
          come from<BR>
           &gt;&gt; Australia, Canada and America (Alison Croggon, Nate
          Dorward, Candice<BR>
           &gt;&gt; Ward and Mark Weiss spring to mind). Mark Weiss may
          HUMOROUSLY refer<BR>
           &gt;&gt; to himself as a savage but he's a regular and respected
          list-member<BR>
           &gt;&gt; who knows more about some aspects of Brit-po than a
          native like<BR>
           &gt;&gt; myself, and I've never heard anyone express anything
          other than<BR>
           &gt;&gt; appreciation for his posts.<BR>
           <BR>
           you missed a few &quot;high-up-in-the-hierarchy subscribers&quot;.
          some of those<BR>
           same people are high-up-in-the-hierarchy subscribers on poetryetc
          too. i<BR>
           guess they are just high-up-in-the-hierarchy sort of folk. they
          are<BR>
           certainly very good at &quot;public&quot; opinion management.<BR>
           <BR>
           but the reason you rarely [but not &quot;never&quot;] hear anyone
          express anything<BR>
           other than appreciation for the posts of the high and mighty
          is because<BR>
           challenging the group at the centre means distancing [disgracing]<BR>
           oneself, defining onself as an outsider, an &quot;extremist&quot;.<BR>
           <BR>
           if it were not kent then eventually someone else would be incensed
          by<BR>
           the lack of fairness evident on british-poets and would point
          out that<BR>
           unfairness in ways which cannot be denied.<BR>
           <BR>
           in the past i've had people backchannel me, thanking me for
          speaking out!<BR>
           i've also had the high-up-in-the-hierarchy nate dorward backchannel
          me<BR>
           with serious allegations with regard to other list members!
          no prizes<BR>
           for guessing who the stuff was aimed at ...<BR>
           <BR>
           like kent, i'm angry that people should be so blatantly self-serving
          -<BR>
           hiding behind a &quot;benign authority&quot; which _seems_ to
          derive from a love<BR>
           of, an intimacy with, british and irish poetry but which turns
          out to<BR>
           be, just as much, the arrogance of an elite.<BR>
           <BR>
