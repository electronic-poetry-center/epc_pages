      <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Reader(s):</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&shy;VeRT has always strived for
      a quiet uninvolved editorial presence, choosing to allow what's
      published to stand on its own. This was comfortable; indeed,
      we felt it ideal.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">However, events of late have compromised
      this quiet unassuming vision. We have been drawn into somewhat
      of a maelstrom, regarding the epistolary exchanges: Dear Lacan,
      which were first posted on the British Poets' ListServ earlier
      this year. The posts were considered by many on the British Poets'
      ListServ to be lacking, both in substance and style. A debate
      ensued on Listserv regarding the work and its creators: Kent
      Johnson and Jacques Debrot.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We chose, being privy to the posts
      of this debate, to publish them en masse. In so doing, we felt
      we were acknowledging the fact that they represented a legitimate
      response to work of such controversial nature. However, we also
      recognized that they were evocative of what we in the experimental
      poetry community confront often: a conservative misunderstanding
      of work that attempts to not only push the proverbial envelope,
      but to transgress it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We also believed that the poets
      quoted therein would stand behind their remarks in total. We
      were, unfortunately, na&iuml;ve in this assumption. After the
      publication of these posts, we received a litany of angry demands
      for retractions and apologies. To some extent these demands were
      not without merit. The posts had, indeed, been edited-- though
      not materially changed. Upon learning of this fact, we chose
      to remove the link to these posts, and assess the situation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Certainly we at &shy;VeRT don't
      want to take ourselves too seriously. In some sense, such seriousness
      hinders what we see as our project. Despite this, this controversy
      has forced us to make serious editorial decisions. We choose
      the following course of action and are publishing:</FONT></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">1. The Lacan Posts: <A HREF="jacques.html">Dear
        Jacques</A> et al as originally published.<BR>
        2. A URL link to the full text of the <A HREF="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-poets.html">British
        Poets' ListServe</A> response to the Lacan text.<BR>
        3. At her request, an edited and complete post from one of the
        participants of the British Poet's ListServ, <A HREF="croggon.html">Allison
        Croggon</A><BR>
        4. An edited, adulterated and poetic response to these posts
        written by one of the Lacan contributors, <A HREF="jacbrit.html">Jacques
        Debrot</A>, along with an Introduction by Slavoj Zizek.<BR>
        5. Lastly, a thoughtful, unedited response to this whole mess,
        provided by <A HREF="duffy.html">Steve Duffy</A>, also a participant
        on the British Poets' ListServ.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">So there it is. We hope that in
      the end these choices reflect a certain quietude that we have
      wanted to maintain, but also beg the question: Whose work is
      it anyway?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Respectfully,<BR>
      Your Loving Editors</FONT></P>
