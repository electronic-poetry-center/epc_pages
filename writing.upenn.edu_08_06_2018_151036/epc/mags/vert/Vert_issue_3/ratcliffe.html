    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Slow motion of the small grey cloud
    above line<BR>
    of trees at crest of ridge, lighter grey white<BR>
    background of clouds above it. Man in the red<BR>
    jacket proposing analogy between reading words<BR>
    on page and hearing them read aloud vs. seeing<BR>
    action performed on stage and hearing about it,<BR>
    girl in blue jacket not wanting to remove her<BR>
    dark glasses. The long green grasses on far<BR>
    edge of pond, relation to a two-dimensional<BR>
    drawing on facing page. Brecht remembering<BR>
    Benjamin's theory, &quot;whatever you look at is<BR>
    looking at you.&quot; Marilyn Monroe in a white<BR>
    cross-strapped dress asking Tom Ewell if he's<BR>
    ever dipped a potato chip into champagne, Ewell<BR>
    noting things like this haven't happened before.<BR>
    Yellow orange circle of sun next to the point, <BR>
    moon's white circle above<BR>
    ridge opposite it.<BR>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Two small white birds moving horizontally
    across <BR>
    distant sunlit and shadowed plane of ridge, grey <BR>
    and white clouds moving above sound of invisible <BR>
    birds in right foreground. Man turning on light <BR>
    at 2 AM who sees two mosquitoes stopped on white <BR>
    bedroom wall, still thinking of Benjamin's claim <BR>
    that &quot;ideas are to objects as constellations are <BR>
    to stars.&quot; Older man in a rain jacket almost <BR>
    blown over edge of the canyon trail noting <BR>
    earth's annual closest approach to the sun, <BR>
    whose light now strikes the planet 7% more <BR>
    intensely than in July. Woman calling to say <BR>
    woman across the street opened her eyes at 7:30, <BR>
    looked at her husband and children and took her <BR>
    last breath. Small grey and white birds driven <BR>
    over storm-tossed water's surface by gale force <BR>
    wind, disappearing into it.</FONT></P>
