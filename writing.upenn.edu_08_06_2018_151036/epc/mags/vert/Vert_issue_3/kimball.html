    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I've saved clippings that might
    amuse you or at least update your intake<BR>
    of &quot;the hidden order&quot; around here which of course embraces
    more than<BR>
    makeshift architecture with rhetoric-based formats which are
    considered<BR>
    quite challenging within the context -- c'est &agrave; mon tour
    de me confondre<BR>
    en excuses: n'ayant pas fait suivre &agrave; Paris mon courrier
    c'est seulement<BR>
    &agrave; mon retour de France que j'ai pris connaissance de votre
    aimable<BR>
    lettre though we met (three years ago?) in Fukuoka after I believe
    I<BR>
    argued (for ten seconds) that the English sonnet parallels _haiku
    _ in<BR>
    its dependency on concision but belated thanks dearly for the
    Easter<BR>
    cards and the extraordinary fortitude in hunting me down in my<BR>
    cave-headquarters here in Barnstable, Cape Cod -- anyway excuse
    me for<BR>
    the rudeness of replying by wordprocessing but so far I have
    located Cid<BR>
    Corman another ex-Bostonian who has lived in Kyoto for forty-plus
    years<BR>
    and who has been a good friend of slightly more eminent poets
    such as<BR>
    Snyder and Ginsberg yet comme le sujet n'est pas en lui-m&ecirc;me
    si vaste je<BR>
    ne pense pas devoir faire une tr&egrave;s longue communication
    though it's<BR>
    astonishing I think that I can use such vocabulary in writing
    you as<BR>
    these words embody virgin scruples that just do not apply in
    the<BR>
    prevailing trade climate and even everyday comity and my own
    situation<BR>
    here in Japan for I enjoy the &quot;looking out&quot; perspective
    in many of my<BR>
    exchanges crammed with poppies narcissus violets new shoots of
    palm fir<BR>
    lilac and rose -- a New England reserve superimposed on all this
    so it<BR>
    comes together with ceramic containers of rainwater (an essential<BR>
    element in any green-blooded Thai garden) and from the &quot;looking
    in&quot; view<BR>
    in my own hope to create a stir after a weekend of &quot;blossom
    viewing&quot; --<BR>
    but I would like to relax the stakes in discussing your verses
    since we<BR>
    have been writing for years right? the mountainous terrain in
    these<BR>
    parts is very northern in fact not a palm tree in sight during
    the<BR>
    yokagura which is an ancient dance repertoire exclusive to the
    major<BR>
    shrine where in honor of Amaterrasu sun goddess and mother of
    Japan it's<BR>
    only now beginning to feel like autumn as well as in palm-strung<BR>
    Miyazaki in the south so that puts us about three months and
    miles<BR>
    behind schedule from the Cambridge perspective because here autumn
    comes<BR>
    first as a visual rather than climactic fluctuation complete
    with surges<BR>
    of ruby hues in fields and by doorways but I feel like a citizen
    of<BR>
    Hartford by way of Stevens and now you and the farmyards' berryladen<BR>
    branches that hang from the little rain roofs we find as protective<BR>
    tokens slotted just above most everyone's entrance and without
    regard to<BR>
    any order here are some other suggestions regarding the brutal
    but<BR>
    spectacular biz of composing poems -- no rain though and that's
    the<BR>
    second sign fall is coming as the summery ten-minute downpours
    that you<BR>
    expect every other day suddenly stop altogether and a week or
    ten days<BR>
    later the air turns dry and much cooler because it changes direction<BR>
    moving southerly to easterly or something over the last half
    year or so<BR>
    with many near-calamities -- typhoons quasi-tsunamis earthquakes
    shaking<BR>
    things up a bit so I'm writing more poetry now making one of
    the dances<BR>
    a kind of preening exercise by Ameno-Usume local tough guy and
    a god in<BR>
    his own right who stations himself just outside Amaterrasu's
    cave<BR>
    jumping grunting and wiggling so provocatively I hadn't counted
    on going<BR>
    back to Perth Amboy this year but it seems that I will be embarking<BR>
    after several minutes of this as A-U succeeds in luring the unsuspecting<BR>
    Amaterrasu from her hiding place leading directly according to
    the logic<BR>
    of allegory to dancing among gods and goddesses and quite recklessly
    the<BR>
    escalation of best wishes to you both</FONT></P>
