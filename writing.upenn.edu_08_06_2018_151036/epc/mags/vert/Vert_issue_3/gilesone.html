        <P><I><FONT SIZE="+1">I hope you wont mind a slight detour before
        we get there, but it is necessary if we want to be prepared for.
        I want to say something about the way that it would be impossible
        to reduce the whole of it to what essentially will be a curious
        note, hardly worth mentioning. This form of construction was
        not taken very seriously. In most handbooks, it has shrunk to
        a mere note at the foot of the page. Such strange excesses have
        always taken place during transition. (You should know and in
        the second place that you flatter yourself, but you are probably
        very much mistaken.) I did not write this to give you a lot of
        facts, all of them have been known for quite a long time and
        they are to be known in any volume devoted to. I merely gathered
        them.</FONT></I></P>
