      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">1.Sir John Douglas Cockcroft<BR>
      There exists none other but that one. You may want to make a
      note of that.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">2.Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<BR>
      Playing the back nine it seemed like a vast frozen lake.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">3. Joel Chandler Harris<BR>
      Nuclear magnetic resonance. High-rise apartment building.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">4. Jean Iris Murdoch<BR>
      I am pointed for that place myself.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Lower world malfeasance. The
      five gentlemen looked at each other.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">5. Anton Bruckner<BR>
      Powerlifting, Chinese checkers, and a British thermal unit.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">6. William Wordsworth<BR>
      Fortran, Cobal, C++</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">7. Simone de Beauvoir<BR>
      Twelve from twenty leaves eight. To think that it should rise
      up against me now. A modern pentathlon. Thomas Bulfinch.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">8. Edwin Estlin Cummings<BR>
      You must set every available man to work. Heir presumptive? Leave
      nothing hanging.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">9. Ford Maddox Ford<BR>
      High frequency speaker. Hold, Perseus! Continue!</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Infighting, hurling coffee, nonstandard
      bingo, and an utter lack of charm. The shout was unanimous and
      savage.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">10. Joel Chandler Harris<BR>
      Golf is neither erotic nor revolutionary. We cannot support it.</FONT></P>

      The rule is but to mark the limit. Here is the cheque for the
      amount. I paid nothing but the usual rent. What changes! And
      in such a short while. You may want to make a note of that. The
      tempest has been as brief as terrific.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We went over to join the discussion.
      Passive skepticism abounds. &quot;A lot of buffalo hump is all
      I hear,&quot; Jorge Louis Borges said. Tennessee Williams is
      expected to recover, though long dead. &quot;Nondischarge of
      debts is no excuse for financial assistance. The Dow Jones Industrial
      Average is no place for situational ethics,&quot; said Charlotte
      Perkins Gilman. Too much cheap rum, we thought. A cheap rum floosie,
      apparently. We'd heard it all before. Back to the electronic
      data processing for us.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">14. Linus Carl Pauling<BR>
      Toy piano. Bad posture. Self-absorbed.</FONT></P>

      Gravitational collapse. It was too dark to see anything. Technically,
      you know, it was only a technical knockout.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Worrisome, all this violence.
      We went to investigate, first checking the electronic mailbox.
      &quot;Eggheads establish trust funds just like the fatcats!&quot;
      Francis Bacon said. The newer Bacon. Firmer. Leaner. More lean.
      &quot;Take a ride on the short line, buddy!&quot; he added. A
      glimmer of hope. A Bill of particulars. The Diplomatic council.
      New developer to build stadiums. Pony rides. Billionaire proposes
      charitable foundation as tax shelter. We go to seek shelter.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">17. Horatio Nelson, the British
      Admiral<BR>
      Read the carefully worded mission statement.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">18. Errico Malatesta, the Italian
      Anarchist<BR>
      Read every eighteenth word to know its true meaning.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Some lay in quiet repose on the
      police station floor while others provide diligent oceangoing
      vessels access to the Atlantic Ocean. We wept at this and went
      back to the electronic data processing devices to check the electronic
      mailboxes again. Canonical hours pass. We seek shelter in the
      cathedral and a return to the wholesome prose of yesteryear.
      We check the price of zinc etchings instead.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">19. Ike and Tina Turner<BR>
      Modern conveniences in these luxury homes help developer to build
      biggest stadium ever.</FONT></P>

      My expedition was all the talk that day, though not the hottest
      initial public offering that I've read about inside my electronic
      mailbox. Within hours I was forgotten. I went swiftly back, saying
      not a word to anybody.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We gave up negative transference,
      Bertolt Brecht and our general rudderless way of being. Fare
      weather friends no more, were we. We decided to accentuate the
      positive, and read Edmund Spenser. He became quite indispensable.
      The vast tumblers of whiskey stopped tilting themselves in our
      general direction. The electronic data processing dropped off
      tremendously.</FONT></I></P>
