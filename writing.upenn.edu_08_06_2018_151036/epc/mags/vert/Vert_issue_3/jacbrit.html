      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I have been asked to say a few additional
      words about the series of e-mails <BR>
      arranged below. Well, it is difficult to know, really, what to
      say, and I <BR>
      indicated precisely that in bemused concern to Mr. Johnson and
      Mr. Debrot. <BR>
      They were insistent, however. &quot;It doesn't matter what you
      say,&quot; wrote Mr. <BR>
      Debrot to me, &quot;You are Zizek. People will eat it up.&quot;
      When I replied that <BR>
      this seemed a rather infantile reason, he wrote me back with
      an abusiveness <BR>
      that was so extreme it became clear-as-a- whistle that he and
      Mr. Johnson <BR>
      very badly wanted me to do it. So:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Firstly, I should note that there
      are a few random and seemingly pointless <BR>
      textual corruptions in the messages below. It is important that
      the <BR>
      originals be consulted, lest one get the idea that the people
      &quot;speaking&quot; are <BR>
      members of a secret, Sadean cult. Thus, the URL pertaining to
      Jiscmail is <BR>
      provided here so that Fiction and Reality may, in the end, retain
      a <BR>
      semblance of their respective &quot;autonomies,&quot; impossible
      as such a <BR>
      metaphysical hope may be, granted.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Still, the reader should be forewarned,
      for she shall find, upon entering <BR>
      the documented, &quot;archived&quot; world of the British-Poets
      list, that the Real is <BR>
      truly more bizarre than the fiction presented here. What I mean
      is this: If <BR>
      voices are being &quot;ventriloquized&quot; in the posts below,
      one may find, in the <BR>
      actual, &quot;original&quot; e-mails, that a whole barnyard will
      often seem to be <BR>
      issuing from the virtual mouths of single individuals! Well,
      this may be a <BR>
      slight exageration, admittedly, but, as Fernando Pessoa once
      famously said, <BR>
      &quot;No se, por supuesto, si ellos son los que no existen o
      si soy yo el <BR>
      inexsistente: en estos casos no debemos ser dogmaticos.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I will end my commentary of this
      bizarre and transgressive appropriation of <BR>
      voices by comparing the project to two films. Mr. Johnson and
      Mr. Debrot <BR>
      asked that I do this, since &quot;many of our readers will have
      an interest in <BR>
      film theory and you are the man.&quot; Very well: I compare the
      text below to 1) <BR>
      the silent, racist classic &quot;Birth of a Nation,&quot; and
      2) to &quot;Black Velvet,&quot; <BR>
      starring the young Elizabeth Taylor. I have my reasons. Let's
      see if readers <BR>
      can figure out the wherefore.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">R or D wondered:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&gt;I wonder where Kent was in 68?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">In '68 I was in Montevideo, Uruguay,
      playing ping-pong in the basement of<BR>
      the U.S. Ambassador's residence with Jimmy Hoyt, son of the Ambassador.<BR>
      There were two maids, toothless and fortyish, whose quarters
      were down<BR>
      there, and they gave us our first blow jobs. Terrifying.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Meanwhile, my father was playing
      golf at Punta Carretas Country Club with<BR>
      Daniel Mitrione, CIA agent training Uruguayan cops in interrogation-torture<BR>
      techniques under cover of AID. My pop worked for the YMCA. A
      couple years<BR>
      later the Tupamaros (MLN) kidnapped Mitrione and shot him. His
      son was a<BR>
      good friend of mine at the Uruguayan-American School.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Costa Gavras made a film about this
      (about the Mitrione affair) called State<BR>
      of Siege, starring a famous French actor whose name I can't remember--
      the<BR>
      same guy in Z. What the hell was his name.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jacques Debrot was there, too. His
      father, a cultural attache with the<BR>
      Spanish Embassy, was actually an MI-5 double-agent. Jacques was
      quiet, kept<BR>
      to himself, reading the Ecrits at recess in French original.
      Impressive for<BR>
      a boy of 12 or 13. Once, a kitten got caught up a ceiba tree
      in the<BR>
      schoolyard. Jacques and I climbed up there to save it while a
      hundred boys<BR>
      in short pants stood gawking in a circle beneath us. At the top
      of the tree<BR>
      I said hi to him, and he looked at me with a twinkle in his eye,
      as if he<BR>
      knew we would speak again in times to come, and said, &quot;Hola.
      Me llamo<BR>
      Jacques. Soy un muchacho espanol con nombre frances.&quot; Little
      could I know<BR>
      the distant meeting his twinkling eye foresaw would end up exploding
      the<BR>
      tight-assed unconscious of British avant-garde poesy.</FONT></P>

      jokes, <BR>
      and pointlessly offensive banter.Suggesting that people simply
      delete what<BR>
      they don't want to read &amp; carry on normally is the same as
      suggesting they try<BR>
      to carry on a phone sexconversation immediately after their wife
      has<BR>
      discovered the credit card charge for Teenage-Fone-Fun. (A true

      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&quot;Swan Song&quot; on the Subject
      line of this because of the irony--swans are, like I<BR>
      have prefered to be until now, mute. So with great regret and
      an even<BR>
      greater sense of drama, I'm outa here after how many? years of
<BR>
      silent, swan-ike lurking, since it started anyway. How often,
      I wonder, did the late-Donald<BR>
      duck-wanna-be Kent Johnson call us &quot;you birdheads.&quot;
      Enough is enough.<BR>
      But I'd be grateful if those with any actual news of the reception
      of my<BR>
      publications and such which might not reach me through &quot;ordinary&quot;
      human<BR>
      channels would keep me posted backchannel of what people are
      saying<BR>
      SPECIFICALLY about my poetry ( L., whose posts have had the effect
      of being a<BR>
      kind of external conscience for my glands; D., who taught me
      how to READ a<BR>
      poem as essentially raw material for my own work; beautiful A
      H , whose<BR>
      moody studio photo I keep on my writing desk; C.; P.<BR>
