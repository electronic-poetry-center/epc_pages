    Last night I stood outside a white building, windowless, surrounded
    by layers of red scaffolding. Metal roof ridged in such a way
    the sun shredded off in all directions. Beside the building a
    tangled wooden launch pad encased a vertical silver rocket.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Inside the rocket: four crew members.
    I remember one in particular, a young woman: pale face that clarified
    everything inside and around it---her lips looked like two lines
    of dark water bobbing between her cheeks as she talked. I asked
    what they were doing--<I>-We're Zen Buddhists experimenting with
    weightlessness as a means of helping us reach Nirvana</I>. I
    told them I had to get out of there. They sat still, silent.
    I found a hatch, cracked it open and jumped out. Soon as I landed
    the boosters started churning. The hatch opened---the pale girl
    looked at me and said, <I>You forgot your hairbrush!</I></FONT></P>

    Random letters and numbers scrolled horizontally across the ceiling.
    I stared, paralyzed. When I woke, I picked up a book, and found
    it difficult to read.</FONT></P>

    <I>A renowned park---</I>whispered a male voice. I opened my
    eyes. Foliage twitched peripherally on wind. Mild air. Maybe
    spring. I couldn't move. My focus froze on a sign. Across the
    sign's center, a tree scribbled in green and brown crayon. Along
    the drawing's left side, a sprawling cursive script, blue ink:</FONT></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">This tree<BR>
    is known<BR>

    I stole Tina's blue cadillac and decided to push it full speed
    past the fields where she lived---having become a famous photographer
    she wanted to isolate herself---in a gaudy Victorian house in
    Virginia. She furnished the backyard with dozens of Arabian horses.
    As I accelerated two of the horses ran with me. I watched them.
    I gained speed and their bodies splintered apart---first their
    noses flaked off, then their heads, and so on, until nothing
    was left but hooves. I raced the hooves all day and night.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Sun pushed into my eyes. I squinted
    and saw the cadillac crumpled against the side of a convenience
    store. Tina stood over me. I told her it wasn't my fault. <I>I
    fell asleep, my foot got stuck. </I>She handed me my shoes. I
    walked away without putting them on.</FONT></P>

    An older man talked to me. He was with three girls and two boys.
    They wore black t-shirts and no pants. <BR>
    We were the only people on the boardwalk.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">At the end of a dock a skyscraper
    was being built. So far it was only a series of metal beams,
    arranged sparingly, over a hundred stories. Long, clear plastic
    sheets wagged from the top.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">They gathered into a prayer-circle.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">What are you doing?<BR>
    <I>We worship structure.<BR>
