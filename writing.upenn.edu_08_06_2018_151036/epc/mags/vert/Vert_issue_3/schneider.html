            I commit myself to the following sentence: &quot;<I>Simply, I
            knew what I liked.</I>&quot; I was comforted by my creativity,
            and I smoothed it out and over my thoughts, a snug uniform that,
            if I had put it on patiently, permanently warmed me up to, and
            for, conversation. The first impressions I thrust upon others
            always began with what I forcefully argued while logic thudded
            to the floor, not trailing behind my opinions but racing instead
            to keep up with them; by the time logic recovered, I had already
            stepped into the next room with everything behind me, leaving
            the former room to its prior incoherence and its adherents who
            didn't know what to make of themselves now that I'd moved ahead
            to further my attentions elsewhere. But this, too, was a game,
            for the word &quot;whim&quot; hinted at improvisation, while
            I had pre-planned every placement of my hands in my pockets.
            My body was nothing to me unless it conveyed the greater purpose
            of what I hurled into the air between myself and the next person.<BR>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Desperation gave way to a conditional
            breathlessness whose resolution would only come in solving the
            problem of and for the subject itself.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">But the subject itself wasn't where
            I was -- in fact, I'd moved quite far ahead of the argument because
            my declaration was in the past tense: <I>I knew what I liked.
            </I>By grammatically positioning myself as an ancestor to my
            own beliefs, I gave my feelings an historical agency to which
            I was responsible while bowing entirely out of an argument which
            history won for me.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">To like
            an object was to like the obligation I felt towards it, the connection
            between self and other, an obelisk I used to essentialize, and
            thereby reduce, the text. By putting what I <I>knew</I> first,
            I wasn't walking, because my body was preceded by the idea I
            had of it, predicting which part of my body would first pass
            through the doorway before anyone had a chance to see my face;
            I appeared to others as an image of who I wanted myself to be,
            an image rooted in the images that are the sole subject of personal
            memory.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">My most vivid image from childhood
            is of the windows in my bedroom. They do not defy description;
            conversely, their &quot;bodies&quot; are almost too simple to
            uphold the imagination which literature demands. I will not draw
            them here; I'd much rather draw them out and draw on them to
            serve the purpose of my writing, which is to question the history
            that I've organized within myself as memory, an implication that
            displays the body I carry around with me, and through which I
            move ever closer towards what the world is asking of me -- and
            my responses to this are nothing, and are contained in nothing,
            but writing.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I <I>was</I> writing then in such
            a way that, when I finally did begin to write, it was the final
            stage in a circular, complex procedure whose endpoint was the
            retracing of modernized names.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The impeccable detachment of sun
            and sky proved to me that it was impossible to be alone in the
            world; to be alone meant that one had fully leaned through the
            the world as if it were another open window; if this was the
            case, then what did this window look out on, and how could I
            get back into my bedroom from where I first noticed the world
            to see how it had changed with what I would now know, or what
            I would later say that had I found out that I knew because I
            had found it there, waiting for me to activate it by drawing
            nearer to it with my body, the very thing I was willing to abandon
            in order to learn? The windows had undoubtedly complicated things,
            showing me that I could doubt their existence while I looked
            right at them, so I looked right through them.</FONT></P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">By tossing names into the air around
            me, I became doubly aware of myself -- I was aware that I had
            been entered into this catalogue of names -- I was suddenly a
            part of it, it was no longer a fence around me which told me
            how much space I had been allotted -- and I was aware that I
            would have to begin to inventory those names that had called
            mine in return.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">As a result of language everything
            around me was implacable and paraded its lack of resolve before
            me while I stood and watched.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I inverted past and future, and
            their meanings no longer converged on the same topic -- I slipped
            out of their collective grip, temporarily evicting the words
            that named them.</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The windows had prepped me for the
            phenomenon of what to call myself. Once I customized the sun
            and sky to my eyes, I noted the houses across the way.</FONT></P>
