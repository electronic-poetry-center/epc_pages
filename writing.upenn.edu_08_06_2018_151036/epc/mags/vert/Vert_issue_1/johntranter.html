  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&lt;&lt;Two Poems&gt;&gt;</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Package Tour</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">There's a gap electricity leaks
  across <BR>
  between the eyeball and the page, between <BR>
  the demonstrator showing off the dicing knife <BR>
  and the tired woman going home on the train. <BR>
  For five million people Paris is a place to work,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">not a fucking vacation. So the young
  flirt <BR>
  went to Europe, meaning to spend her money. <BR>
  Cigarette packets, rain showers, Existentialism <BR>
  blowing through the groups of confused tourists <BR>
  whistling some tune, these prisoners of air,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">a sad little melody that spelled
  out how <BR>
  lost they were, under the European weather. <BR>
  She walked in the rain, the acid drench <BR>
  that was pouring on the new wet paint, <BR>
  wading through sheets of green gauze.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Her anxiety was quickly dispatched,
  and the messages <BR>
  soon sparked down the wire to clang the bell <BR>
  back home. The hot air was shuddering, they said <BR>
  it was necessary voice flattened by the phone <BR>
  to make an example of the rapist feller;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">and the girl reporter read about
  it on the Teletype <BR>
  and came down here looking for trouble. <BR>
  We gave her trouble, more than she planned on. <BR>
  Click. I guess it was some family habit. <BR>
  She was working class, all right.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">You could tell, under the cunning
  accent <BR>
  she put on, something hollow, stained, fake. <BR>
  Everything in the kitchen could be overheard. <BR>
  To paint that's all she wanted to do, <BR>
  even if was just grasping lies.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">You could take it that this was
  only a moral lesson, <BR>
  or you could imagine more. That's up to you. <BR>
  She pushed the doors open, looking in <BR>
  at the confused diners, and only a moment ago <BR>
  she'd been fascinated by history's obsession with itself,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">how we stayed up and talked till
  dawn <BR>
  when we were just dumb kids, like philosophers. <BR>
  She drank ouzo and retsina until even the Greeks <BR>
  wouldn't have any more of her, drank <BR>
  till dawn, threw up, then drank some more.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">It had been raining in the square,
<BR>
  the cobbles were slick, and coming home <BR>
  from another binge, she slipped, twisted her <BR>
  ankle and knocked out a tooth on the kerb. <BR>
  So the biographer says.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">She wore a raincoat everywhere,
  a matter of <BR>
  style, to work, to the toilet, God knows, and <BR>
  when she let it slip to the floor the buckle clacked <BR>
  on the tiles. She saw her future rise up, a sheet <BR>
  of lightning. Paris or Peoria, it's all the same.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">South Farm</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">You get yourself a beer from the
  fridge, pour a glass, <BR>
  and stand, watching the froth settle, remembering <BR>
  or you're leafing through a magazine at the dentist's, <BR>
  and you see a colour photo of a fox in a forest <BR>
  I was after this fox, he said, looked everywhere.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Clever bastards, they know more
  than you do. <BR>
  I must have walked four miles through the bush. <BR>
  I took a rest on this big hollow log. Lovely morning, <BR>
  dew on the grass, everything quiet. I rolled a smoke, <BR>
  very peaceful. Heard a noise, looked around,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">and the bloody fox shot out of the
  log <BR>
  and off into the bracken. I just laughed. <BR>
  Remember? Dad's laugh had a special resonance, <BR>
  his voice, relaxed, the rhythm of breath I hear it <BR>
  sometimes, now that he's gone, long gone</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">under the ground, smoke up the chimney,
<BR>
  I hear it sometimes at a party, from the next room, <BR>
  and I go in to look, anxious, excited no, <BR>
  there's no one there, except myself in the mirror. <BR>
  The drink it's just something to get you started,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">breaking the ice of the held-in
  talk. He said <BR>
  a rabbit would stretch the meagre rations <BR>
  during the war which war? baked in milk, very <BR>
  palatable. And the old radio on the kitchen table <BR>
  was thronged with the noise of the city celebrating,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">far away behind the eucalyptus-crowded
  hills, <BR>
  and yet close enough to touch. The traffic drone <BR>
  came from behind the scenery, the urban horizon, <BR>
  fixed about so high, and there were closer sounds <BR>
  talk, murmurs, the noise of people shopping.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Are you just passing by? I whispered
  for they <BR>
  had an odd look: just visiting the planet aren't we all? <BR>
  And that struggle, growing up, dying, <BR>
  what does it matter now? His son <BR>
  had read the story he particularly liked</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">the whish of passing tyres on the
  street outside <BR>
  seemed to spell out a message that he was doomed <BR>
  to linger in this dim room, lonely, bored, <BR>
  trying to understand the television that seemed to be <BR>
  speaking another language to the furniture</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">until he could be rescued by his
  family only <BR>
  one problem he didn't have any family. <BR>
  I am my father's son. In the empty kitchen <BR>
  the crockery was cold, the dishwasher had stopped <BR>
  long ago, the detective reasoned he'd retired</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">from his position examining the
  books <BR>
  for this so-called library, what a laugh, and now <BR>
  he was raking over the detritus of a life spent <BR>
  trying to farm stubborn soil. Take me <BR>
  back to my real parents. I am that detective.</FONT></P>
