  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">plump blonde new-ager surrounded
  by big green slug-type things I call salamanders. <BR>
  but nikky sez salamanders are red. hence the fire connection,
  that's why phoenix <BR>
  came up. that's why earlier flying on an afghan scared and mark
  sez aw come on. above <BR>
  icy scene of pine trees and lake and snow covered hills. not
  a place you'd want to fall <BR>
  but the possibility of falling is what makes it real</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">there's a sign above my desk and
  it says gender</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">hide it under a bushel no. in the
  fall bushel baskets people put leaves in. leaf fires. the <BR>
  smell meaning something's been raked. bands around the baskets
  holding vertical strips <BR>
  in place were<BR>
  green</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear A,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Time dries. Reality fingers. A car
  alarm punctures the power-line-moon-map you created <BR>
  and we laid out. You used to be a book, now you're a book order.
  Three women face <BR>
  water, pluck at lemons. A cavorting dog intervenes.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear B,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Messages from you sound happy. I
  play them back. Head of the year, grime creeps on a<BR>
  window. Apples and honey in Chicago. Lost feels good to you when
  you eat.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear C,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We agree on ten minutes. In that
  space my eggs grow wings. The relation of each to a<BR>
  replaceable third forms the core of this dilemma. A man knelt
  at another's knees. Pronounce <BR>
  this name for me. Spell it backward.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear D,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Your presentation, my presentation.
  Funny how we nail ourselves to passing clouds, hurl<BR>
  ourselves past events in order to get some sleep. I forgive us.
  Here are the numbers 44 and <BR>
  45. A soup of questionable leftovers. Font, cream, a song improvised
  on a rocker.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear E,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Stink. Adamant. How do I use this
  disposable camera. Don't burn your hair. Who spit the <BR>
  nuts out of the peanut m&amp;m's. Everyone at this party designs
  something. Think of it as a story <BR>
  I didn't get around to writing.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear F,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Think of a better printer, you who
  place a welcome bid. Think of how you're plump bird. <BR>
  A correspondent resistance, a shadow box. I like to see you all
  lined up in a museum. <BR>
  Your sex is a button lighting underwater blue. Your shape is
  an introduction, your <BR>
  sweaty nape midwestern.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear G,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I give you compliments. If you're
  a better mother. If yellow's not a color. If filter means <BR>
  a mouth in my mouth. If girls beat me up. If we hoist cold matter.
  A snowball. I should <BR>
  send you one. Monopoly. Favor.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear H,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I believe you always live like this,
  this couch, this office. Bias cut. You've studied a certain <BR>
  man and left him for dead. You've chosen grey under skin zone.
  I like how you talk of a pig <BR>
  like it's some kind of pillow. How mother steps out of refrigerator.
  Lines shoot out from all <BR>
  your fingers, connecting dots.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear I,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Towel becomes curtain, thank tacks.
  What happened to the &quot;d' in &quot;David.&quot; Who became
  the <BR>
  little dead neighbor. Who broke stones. Jew. Pedagogy. 22. Recast
  this as me looking at a<BR>
  dianthus, past that a tree, past that a painting by Caravaggio.
  I mean go around the bend like<BR>
  light can.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear J,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">When you take a pill I do, sugar
  daddy. Here's how to lay a rug. I'm all cuted out. Your eyes<BR>
  lean slightly forward from the waist. Flat back, arms extended.
  The invention of writing took <BR>
  the &quot;du&quot; out of &quot;you.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear K-Z,</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Tiny's head is cut off in your beautiful
  fake forest. You rule the summer. So polite verdant <BR>
  hair, white hills, a Canadian could learn to love you if she
  attended the lecture. She's just <BR>
  a nurse living in the south, her mother's a home owned by six
  offspring. Who confabulate. <BR>
  Let's leave it for the next generation. Let's put it on a flatbed
  truck and drive it somewhere.</FONT></P>
