      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Love. Lashes of sugar on tongue.<BR>
      Not that this sweetness becomes</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">an extension of something recognizable.<BR>
      I want to break all ties with time.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">What I recognize as familiar is
      not time.<BR>
      When I say I do not like this particular red</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">flower it has nothing to do with
      the flower<BR>
      itself. But with the people who belong to it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I want the moment of your first
      entrance<BR>
      to be a meeting ground for evidence.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Your ample arms. A half-bloom of
      lotus<BR>
      in your left hand. A pen or maybe a sword</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">in your right. Seen again, how contours<BR>
      distress sight. Seen through angular rain,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">soft you make yourself seem.<BR>
      Wet. Unable to keep dry.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Love, people emerge from the street's
      insides in<BR>
      a retreating army's silence. The metal caterpillar<BR>
      throws them into unacknowledged intimacy. <BR>
      They do not look at each other. They do not hold <BR>
      hands. Deeper into the dark,<BR>
      slip into Babel choir. Scissor arms.<BR>
      In the city, I am exempted from being like you.<BR>
      No alms for strangers. No mid-day tea in the sun.<BR>
      Deities remain at the altar. I am self-sufficient.<BR>
      Signs direct me at every corner.</FONT></P>
