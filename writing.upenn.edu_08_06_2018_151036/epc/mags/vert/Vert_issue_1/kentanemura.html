  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Bye Bye Blackbird</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Moderate paced streets, some pretty
  faces,<BR>
  a cigarette dangles from my fingers,<BR>
  the diner stays open, newspapers talk about the comedy of leaves,<BR>
  it was warm enough when wind from the marina floated over rooftops<BR>
  in this street with a liquor store and laundromat,<BR>
  stained sidewalks littered with candy bar wrappers,<BR>
  the homeless man fails to deliver his pitch,<BR>
  my pockets are empty anyway.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The girl with dyed hair, passive
  ears filled with half-arguments,<BR>
  the refrigerator hums mysterious sounds at dusk,<BR>
  guava juice, blinds darken the room<BR>
  a studio without corridors, without the luxury of cupcakes,<BR>
  you have to buy your own coffee,<BR>
  it doesn't feel like home to you.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Find the person who will point out
  the North Star for you,<BR>
  who will name flowers and colors for you,<BR>
  beyond the obvious concerns of rose and blue....</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I'm a late bloomer who planted my
  trees too early,<BR>
  picture frames and old wood, with sugar on top,<BR>
  clarinets and postcards thrown into the mix,<BR>
  the moon's not yet risen here, we share the summer, July, we
  share dusk<BR>
  and threads of the liquid amber,<BR>
  not as leafy as the lush growth on hills and boulevards of your
  hometown,<BR>
  there's no juice left, I chose to have a glass of water before
  I left,<BR>
  tea instead with my jelly donut,<BR>
  I chose to sit on red sheets, a dad drive over the bridge,<BR>
  familiar city lights sparkling, night air summery soft, sea,
  downtown, shop<BR>
  windows,<BR>
  my watch ticks, I overdose on a day I forgot to drink,<BR>
  I looked at a girl with intense eyes, watched the back of her
  head<BR>
  as she strode down the sidewalk as if her eyes were still apparent
  to me</FONT></P>
