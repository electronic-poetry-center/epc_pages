<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">The French
      poet and thinker Paul Val&eacute;ry once said that after Dante's
      <I>Divine Comedy</I> and Balzac's <I>Human Comedy</I>, it was
      time to start a third, &quot;intellectual&quot; comedy treating
      the adventures and transformations of human thought. <BR>
<BR>
      Comedy, in the Dantean and Balzacian sense, is the most monumental
      of all genres, the genre depending least on the will of its author
      and most on the condition of his society, which, as it were,
      dictates to him, turning him into its literary secretary (this
      image comes from Balzac's preface to his work). Every society
      gets the comedy it deserves.<BR>
<BR>
      Val&eacute;ry himself did not write the &quot;third&quot; comedy,
      although he had all the necessary qualifications for it: the
      broadest erudition, the subtlest intellect, and a great artistic
      genius. But he still lived in the Balzacian world of the &quot;human
      comedy,&quot; where the moving force of all events was human
      beings, their characters, passions, interests. Dante, for his
      part, had lived in a society welded together by Christian faith
      and organized on the model of the church. Its moving force was
      the authority of the divine Revelation, which had laid out the
      path leading from the sinful depths of earthly life to the bright
      crystal heavens of paradise. <BR>
<BR>
      The <I>Divine Comedy</I> was as much a necessary expression of
      medieval, &quot;feudal&quot; society as the <I>Human Comedy</I>
      was of property-owning, &quot;bourgeois&quot; society. And these
      works were written in the very countries that were the classic
      models of the corresponding social-spiritual organization: pre-Renaissance
      Italy and post-Revolutionary France.<BR>
<BR>
      The model of the third type of society, which we may tentatively
      call &quot;socialist,&quot; appeared in post-Revolutionary Russia.
      It was precisely here that a new moving force appeared at the
      foundation of society: the force of <B><I>ideas</I></B>. It was
      ideas that brought the Revolution, waged the Civil and Great
      Patriotic Wars, established plants and factories-not only in
      order to produce something material, but also to assert the productivity
      of the ideas themselves. Socialist society is the only society
      constructed according to a previously laid plan based on ideas
      born in the minds of its thinker-founders; it is the most speculative
      and &quot;premeditated&quot; society on earth. Socialism is society
      without God and without things-spiritually and materially poor
      but rich in ideology, built on ideas alone-the kingdom of ideas
      ruling in its own name, where a ruler rules only in the name
      of an idea or as the impersonation of an idea, the triumph of
      its truth. <BR>
<BR>
      In socialist Russia, the things that feudal and bourgeois society
      lived by lost their prestige and reality. A tense and conscious
      battle is waged against God-or, rather, against the <I>idea</I>
      of God, since His actual existence is denied. Likewise, a struggle
      is conducted for the idea of plenty, although articles of material
      luxury and even necessities themselves disappear. But in any
      case, only ideas-ideas of what is, ideas of what is not-have
      an acknowledged and felt reality, ruling over human beings. Everything
      that exists outside of ideas, whether acknowledged or denied,
      loses its living reality and recedes into the background. There
      is a struggle <I>agains</I><B>t</B> the idea of God, though there
      is no actual God; there is a struggle <I>for</I> the idea of
      plenty, though there is also no actual plenty. Ideas are all
      there is. They neither save us in the next life nor feed us in
      this one, but they do give us the feeling that our life is rightly
      lived and our death is not in vain. <BR>
<BR>
      Thus, the third comedy, the comedy of ideas, arises precisely
      from the self-consciousness of socialist society, whose inner
      spring is neither the will of God nor the private interests of
      human beings, but ideas in which the faith and passion of immense
      human masses are concentrated. The whole life of socialist society
      revolves not around the &quot;divine&quot; and not around the
      &quot;human&quot; but around some third thing, for which no suitable
      name has yet been invented, but which can be defined as the &quot;ideational&quot;-life
      according to the idea.<BR>
<BR>
      Ludicrous and terrible-in the highest sense comical-is a human
      being who has fallen away from God into sin, living by merely
      human laws. Just as comical is a human being who is possessed
      by the passion for things, who has fallen away from everything
      human, living by the laws of the material world, in the interests
      of wealth, career, acquisition. Such are the characters of the
      Dantean and Balzacian worlds: the venal Bonturo and the usurious
      Gobsec; <I>pere</I> Ugolino and Pere Grandet, fathers who devour
      their own children; the thieves de Pazzi and Vautrain, Pope Nicholas
      III and the careerist Rastignac. But the characters of the <I>Comedy
      of Ideas</I>, perhaps, need no names-they are well enough served
      by initials, abstracted from concrete names as ideas are abstracted
      from concrete persons. As comical as the falling away from divinity
      and from humanity may be, there is nothing more comical than
      the idea, for in it the human being falls away from everything
      substantial and even from himself, from whatever is individual
      and unique in himself. <BR>
<BR>
      The idea promises everything-and takes everything. There is no
      subject more worthy of comic representation, more distracted
      and addled, than the idea, for it is both more than and less
      than itself. It is at once heroic and parodic, surpassing what
      is and laying claim to what is not, full and empty, virtuous
      and vicious, an envoy to the Future and an abortion of Non-being.
      An idea is a something raised to the highest power, and for that
      very reason it corresponds to nothing and means nothing. Ideas:
      to unleash and intensify the class struggle for the sake of the
      classless society; to wipe out the wealthy for the sake of the
      common wealth; to devalue labor in support of the value of labor;
      to dry up the sea in the wilderness and pour it into flourishing
      plains; to fight militantly in the struggle for peace; to die
      of hunger in the struggle for the harvest; to annihilate matter
      in the struggle for materialism. Every idea bears within itself
      a staggering comedy that has cost millions of people a tragic
      life.<BR>
<BR>
      But what is tragic on the level of individual destinies underlies
      the comedy of Destiny itself. Ideas have destroyed the people
      who asserted them, but at the same time, through the tragedy
      of the generations, they have revealed their essentially comic
      nature. This is why comedy need not blush to tumble onstage in
      the still-warm tracks of tragedy, on the same boards, perhaps
      even simultaneously with tragedy, in the same roles. Alongside
      the<I> Gulag Archipelago</I>, the tragedy of the tortured and
      guillotined, grows its enormous shadow-the vaudeville of the
      very ideas that had played the roles of the torturers. People
      were sacrificed to the Idea; but while these sacrifices were
      heaping up before the Idea in its priestly role, it started clowning
      and winking, bustling around the bloody arena in whiteface, puffing
      up its cheeks and breathing its last; in the role of the hangman-buffoon,
      it would grab its own head by the hair and drag it to the scaffold.
      One and the same act of the historical drama is played both as
      the tragedy of living people and the comedy of the specters that
      rule them. <BR>
<BR>
      Tragedy, as the literary treatises say, moves from a happy to
      a sad situation, comedy from a sad to a happy. Tragedy embraces
      that period of our history when people, apparently made happy
      by the triumph of their ideas, turned out to be caught in their
      tightening trap: &quot;from the happy to the sad.&quot; Comedy
      embraces the period when the ideas, having taken people captive,
      suddenly emerged from prison walls as a vaudeville stage set,
      a bunch of crumpled cardboard junk: &quot;from the sad to the
      happy.&quot; Each took place through the other. The ideas had
      to be painted in blood so that history could later pour out its
      bile on them. <BR>
<BR>
      Thus it is by the steps of the three comedies that the comic
      descends into the destiny of mankind: first the human without
      God, then the person without humanity, finally the idea without
      the person.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">Encyclopedia as
      Genre</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">In this sense, comedy
      is a genre whose contents may be embodied in completely different
      forms depending on the epoch. The<I> Divine Comedy</I> took the
      form of a poem, to which it was disposed by its very subject,
      the ascent of the soul seeking nearness and union with God. The
      <I>Human Comedy</I> took the form of a series of novels, since
      the novel is defined precisely by its concentration on the fate
      of the isolated man, the private individual-not in his relation
      to the highest will, as in the poem, but in his struggle with
      external circumstances. <BR>
<BR>
      What form would best correspond to the contents of the third
      comedy? As a poem is directed to the heights of the divine and
      a novel to the depths of the human, so an encyclopedia is directed
      at the breadth of the variegated world of ideas. If the poem
      of Dante unfolds in the timeless space of the three worlds beyond
      the grave, on the hero's path through hell, purgatory, and heaven;
      if the novels of Balzac unfold in historical time, in the serial
      plot of actions and events, in the intrigues and conflicts of
      the characters;- then the third comedy can unfold only in that
      timeless and spaceless continuum where ideas co-exist and communicate
      among themselves-not by means of spatial or temporal connections
      but exclusively by means of references, citations, ideal attractions
      and repulsions. This intelligible continuum of ideas, all existing
      and calling out to one another at the same time, is the encyclopedia.<BR>
<BR>
      As a collective genre that preserves and displays the sum of
      received knowledge, this genre is beloved of socialist society
      and answers the needs of its transhistorical nature. There is
      no time in the kingdom of ideas; it abides in itself, indexed
      in an invisible card catalogue where all the ideas that society
      acknowledges as worthy of existence are fully cross-referenced.
      And it makes no difference whose name is signed to the exposition
      of these ideas: the more authoritative an encyclopedic publication,
      the more likely the authors names are to be omitted. After all,
      it is not individuals who answer for the ideas but the ideas
      that govern the individuals. /./</FONT></P>
