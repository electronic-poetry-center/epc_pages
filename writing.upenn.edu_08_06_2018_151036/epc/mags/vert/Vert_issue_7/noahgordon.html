      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">They came after the flowers
      with questions. One made of light whose wake you stepped in.
      One repeating <I>take this.</I> The trees gathered at once around
      us as if loss were a soil with more give than thirst. The map
      we were left with was of my throat, the words like a river, the
      stone you threw in falling. Each window now darkened. Near the
      edge, they said, yet meant over it. The birds turning on too
      early. The voices stripping like solvent. We spent half the day
      breathing, half trying to forget sleep. Worried whether smoke
      or steam carried more weight &amp; which would freeze first.
      &quot;This road leads to my sentence's end,&quot; you said. That
      much the map made clear: each icon, unfolding / each junction,
      a sleeve.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I woke up back inside myself,
      my skin now loosened, the nails flopping from the ends of my
      fingers, our torch almost out of oil. &quot;No one believes in
      cobblestone anymore,&quot; you whispered, &quot;more concern
      for the knees than nostalgia.&quot; How is a hook like a heart?
      A breath like a bone? &quot;Every morning I touch the spines
      of my books,&quot; you explained, &quot;Half, I'll never open,
      the ones I love most.&quot; they came later though they'd like
      us to believe different. Convinced a shovel strapped to your
      back was all you'd need to find the next entry point, you tore
      the pages as you read, tossed them into the fire. I was cold
      &amp; thirsty.</FONT></P>
