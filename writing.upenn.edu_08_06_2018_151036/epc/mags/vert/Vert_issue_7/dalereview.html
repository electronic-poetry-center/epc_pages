      A review of <I>The Body</I>, Jenny Boully, <A HREF="http://www.slope.org/">Slope
      Editions,</A> 2002, 80 pages, $12.95'</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Garamond">By Dale Smith</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">There are bodies of evidence, of transgression,
      ritual and consumption. Bodies of knowledge, feeling, space and
      sensuality converge into forms that relate physical and imaginative
      projections. The body is an illusion, a grouping of cells in
      rebellion to codes and signs that brand it to transform it. A
      body is meaningless; only its appearance gives meaning. It's
      the ultimate product, a gratifying medium of appetite. It can
      be prepared for sexual encounter, or it can shield its host from
      painful contact. The body is a revelator of racial origin, or
      a morphological mask of cultural or geographic sources.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">William Blake: &quot;Man has no Body
      distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul
      discerned by the five Senses.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Jenny Boully's book-length essay, <I>The
      Body </I>(Slope Editions)<I>, </I>presents a series of footnotes
      appended to an absent body of words. I'm not interested in projecting
      onto that considerable absence. I am glad to be rid of the tiresome
      narrative, to be left only with the notes, the juice and inwardness.
      Narrative is out of shape. It needs a diet. The footnotes to
      this big blank give Boully a justification for extending Modernism's
      fragment crystals. Her footnotes are really poems, prose revelations
      of her creative and textual environments. What Blake called the
      Divine Body or the Creative Imagination in this book is projected
      from the living pulses of its author. Intelligence works here,
      and it's sincere despite the crass reminder, that obscene space
      dominating her pages.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">William Blake:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Why wilt thou give to her a Body whose
      life is but a Shade?<BR>
      Her joy and love, a shade: a shade of sweet repose:<BR>
      But animated and vegetated, she is a devouring worm</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Her screen is also the open space of
      disaster. It's the ground zero of texts to which personal feelings
      and thoughts are but slight appendages. After the sheer pleasure
      of the spectacle, in the banal presence of the ruins, peripheral
      images form. These are antithetical to the big narratives of
      State and Economy. Behind our mediated and compromised bodies
      there's a Manichean battle. Disaster threatens every moment.
      Not even Charles Wright (FBI) can save us. Who can peer through
      their screens to realign the cathode ray?</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Garamond">Ezekiel 1:4: </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;And
      I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
      cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness <I>was </I>about
      it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of
      the midst of the fire.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Even the sky casts images; so too, the
      black of night, the whitest page, our unadorned flab.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Some mornings the sunlight on the yard
      reaches with impassive gloom. How lovely that depressing movement.
      How indifferent. But suddenly something clicks, a wheel within
      a wheel. The baby is crying. The dishes are in the sink. My little
      life, in all its imaginative glory, shines.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">But the count keeps coming, and I am
      the screen, the receptor of images. April <I>is </I>the cruelest
      month. War gods cluck over coffee, admiring their plans. They
      dispatch spirits into erupting matter. A church ignites, sending
      a vertical black plume into blue firmament. Bomb(s) deface a
      federal building, stone crushing screaming daycare tots. The
      98th Meridian snakes up the Midwest. The screen is fat with images.
      We're caught in the upload and download, a switch signaling endlessly.
      The body of the public rises with dramatic ceremony. Then, in
      its liberation, it walks off stage. There's a bow, a few hangings,
      political murders and tear gas for the masses. (Even old Odysseus
      strings his maids out on the line). And poof. Into thin air,
      or the blank pages of a book, the projected images of our world
      vanished.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Jean Baudrillard: &quot;The magical
      seduction of the world must be reduced, annulled. And it will
      be so the day when all signifiers receive their signifieds, when
      all has become meaning and reality.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">&quot;This would be, quite obviously,
      the world's end.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Jenny Boully: &quot;I want a new category.
      The game host is cruel. I act in the manner that I think will,
      in the end, be more rewarding. I like to think someone is secretly
      watching and loving me. It makes me feel utterly tragic &amp;
      cosmic in my emotional proportions. Magical things befall daily.
      Dare I think [illegible]? I have refused call after call because
      I truly believe that the journey shouldn't be unless it is magically
      in-tune with my vision.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">She's writing into a chronicle of disaster.
      Here, fate pushes appearances forward, tweaking our attention.
      Likewise, chance intervenes to relieve me of summer's cruel intensity.
      Here's cold beer, a dark corner and conversation already older
      than old. &quot;I don't see the evidence,&quot; someone says,
      but that's because he has never truly appeared to himself. But
      then again, we all seem caught in the tensions of appearing and
      disappearing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Jean Baudrillard: &quot;When things
      go faster than their causes, they have the time to <I>appear,
      </I>to occur as appearances before even becoming real. It's then
      that they keep their power of seduction.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">What the-?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Again: &quot;We believe in a hidden
      sexual truth of the body, this body being nothing more than a
      surface for decipherment. We believe in the primacy of an informal
      energy, or of a depth of meaning (the law inscribed deep in people's
      hearts) whose purpose is to make its way through the confusion
      of signs. And we're ready to transgress established codes to
      make the Law and Truth shine forth in their splendor.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">You want evidence of a world, but there's
      only-if you're lucky-an adventure into inwardness. How connect
      through these flesh vessels? Sexual pleasure substitutes for
      something other, something alien to the flesh and its blinding
      secretions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Boully: &quot;poetry is an instant,
      an instant in which transcendence is achieved, where a miracle
      occurs and all of one's knowledge, experiences, memories etc.
      are obliterated into awe. Is anything I say real? And by real,
      I mean <I>sincere</I>-or is everything an attempt to procure
      love? I know now why the line breaks: it is because something
      dies, and elsewhere, is born again&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Baudrillard (again?): &quot;Our fundamental
      destiny is not to exist and survive, as we think: it is to appear
      and disappear.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Poetry is perfection too, the practice
      of relations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">These footnotes read with Sei Shonagan's
      wise physicality. On the other hand, these tendons and muscles,
      mucus secretions and toe jam are contrary to our idealism. They
      interject a broad claim onto our attention. Boully's body of
      blank pages only brings this physicality forward, brutally managing
      it as the draining limit to imagination. But now the screen seems
      wider. The sky, not the page or the televised image, makes a
      proper relation to our Stone Age cranium clusters. We still imagine
      in the realm of the Upper Paleolithic, not according to tedious
      social urgencies, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Boully: &quot;23 The marginalia are
      as follows: (1.) So too will we confront the one whom the gods
      have created for us; (2.) And, alas, it is so; (3.) If this is
      true, then the implication is that one cannot destroy what is
      feared-the general attributes are embodied elsewhere; (4.) Failure
      of love to be more than fleeting; (5.) Yes, our hero goes alone;
      (6.) What is feared takes the shape of a serpent; (7.) This would
      make a lovely title; (8.) The gifts of course are symbolic of
      spiritual unions; (9.) ha ha!; (10.) Is he speaking of he virgin
      or a whore?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Reconciliation to bodies is absurd.
      They are to be tested, as the spirit, pushed to whatever limit
      the imagination can restore. These footnotes show with quiet
      thoughtfulness a living adventure within the noisome burden of
      the present. Forget silence, absence or void-any of that. There's
      too much of everything. It's a cacophony driving us mad, distracting
      us, throwing our center into an endless traffic jam. Boully attends
      the quiet of Art and dream.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Boully: &quot;97.1 'It was not I that
      revealed the secret of the gods; the wise man learned it in a
      dream' (G.).&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Vallis (Bombastus) Faber: &quot;The
      body steps away from you. It finds itself useless. All around
      you they are stricken by the madness of civilization. A wheel
      in the sky is burning. Wheels inside yet more wheels. The question
      is, quite bluntly, what to do with them. (All six billion?-or
      just mine?) What's a body to do?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Perhaps that's not a poet's concern.
      Blake's answer: &quot;my business is to Create&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">I take clear notes from <I>The Body,</I>
      and dust a little ash (Montecristo) from these pages as I write.
      Sunlight drenches the veranda. A decanter of brandy plays with
      the late evening reds. A cardinal yodels distantly. I absently
      flip pages in David Erdman's volume of Blake, finding again that
      sweet nostalgic hope in liberation before security took us by
      thrall.</FONT></P>
      <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Garamond">The Divine Vision still was
      seen<BR>
      Still was the Human Form, Divine<BR>
      Weeping in weak &amp; mortal clay<BR>
      O Jesus still the Form was thine.</FONT></CENTER></P>
      <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Garamond">And thine the Human Face &amp;
      thine<BR>
