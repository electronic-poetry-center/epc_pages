    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">I want to broach the
    subject of &quot;literary silence&quot;, the question being what
    literature allows to be said about it. <BR>
    It may be argued, of course, that &quot;anything can be said&quot;
    regarding literature, not to mention what literature, itself,
    contains by way of a subject &shy; that the subject of literature,
    too, can be this same &quot;anything&quot;. It appears that there
    are no limits to literature when we are approaching what lies
    inside it. <BR>
    But we know that this is pure falsity. There are <I>always</I>
    limits; the lack of a limit is less our concern than what constitutes
    this limit and how we know we have hit upon it, when we are at
    it and can do nothing besides notice it or retreat from it. When
    do we arrive at this limit -- and when we <I>do</I> arrive, is
    this limit silence itself?<BR>
    But what is this silence? Is it not one of many silences, too
    numerous for us to count? (<I>Yes</I>)<BR>
    So it appears that I have reached an impossibility &shy; that
    of defining the silence that literature approaches, that it must
    miss in order to continue to speak. <BR>
    Wittgenstein's &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, one must remain
    silent&quot; hangs over our heads. It would be foolish for me
    not to acknowledge it, lest I, too, allow silence to disarm me.
    Perhaps the silence for which I am searching is the thing that
    literature cannot say and remain literature, the thing that,
    if literature were to say it, would threaten the genre with obsolescence.
    But another phrase arrives to reroute our argument &shy; George
    Bataille's, from &quot;The Impossible<I>&quot;</I>: &quot;<I>I
    approach poetry, only to miss it.</I>&quot; We are lead into
    further questions regarding literary creation -- what does it
    mean to intend literature, but nevertheless fail to achieve it?
    At what point is literature itself only an intention that, not
    evident in the writing itself, only ghosts the writing, but which,
    as a trace, exists outside of the writing? Here is where the
    true limit of literature appears &shy; within the writing itself,
    within what we might call that which writes itself.<BR>
    So the limit of literature is that element which, when missing,
    shows the writing to be something &quot;other&quot; than literature.<BR>
    The silence of reading is defined by the act. My eyes glean the
    words of the book, and I cannot speak while I read. Nor can I
    be spoken to. (As a child, I read to hold back the voice of my
    mother, who spoke only to interrupt and interrogate me. I read
    for the &quot;<I>I cannot speak</I>&quot; as well as the &quot;<I>Do
    not speak to me!</I>&quot;)<BR>
    But this is <I>reading </I>(and, in my case, the psychology of
    reading); literature has very little to do with the act of reading
    as a physical project in so far as the physicality of reading
    defines literature as literary. However, the readability of the
    work is always in question.<BR>
    <I>The readability of the work is always in question</I> &shy;
    perhaps this is where our search begins, now that we have located
    the source of literary silence &shy; how legible the work is
    as writing, both to reader and writer in tandem.<BR>
    Much has been said of the reader/writer relationship &shy; most
    recently that the reader is now seen as a co-creator in the work's
    meaning. But beyond that, reader and writer work in tandem, independently
    of one another, to make the work stand in the world. But the
    standing in the world &shy; the &quot;having read&quot; that
    exists between reader and writer, the &quot;having read&quot;
    that places the work in question (the question of the work that,
    now that the physical reading of the work is in the past, remains,
    all that remains of the work) &shy; is one of silent agreement:
    I write something (it is complete with me), you read something
    (it is complete with you), and the completion exists between
    us <I>without our ever having spoken</I>. We may meet, and we
    may even speak of what is between us (the work), but what we
    say is not the experience of the work, it is other than the work
    &shy; it is now what we have of the work, what we are of the
    work now that we have left it.<BR>
    <I>Literary Silence</I>, then, is what I would call the thing
    missed in the translation, but the thing that always remains
    in the words themselves, what calls us back to the book, but
    which we cannot leave without. But we cannot say it. Even Bataille's
    words &shy; &quot;<I>I approach poetry, only to miss it&quot;
    </I>&shy; words that appear in the context of <I>The Impossible</I>,
    a story about the story that cannot be told &shy; are, in my
    usage of them, a misconstruing, because the story has disappeared
    in lieu of the aphorism, which, now missing its narrator, is
    language unhinged and made into the &quot;anything&quot; with
    which this essay began, where what is said is <I>always</I> said
    without limits. But these are the limits to which the writer
    of literature succumbs, regardless of his or her knowledge: <I>&quot;What
    I know of the book is what the book tells me, but what I cannot
    repeat -- or the book disappears.&quot;<BR>
