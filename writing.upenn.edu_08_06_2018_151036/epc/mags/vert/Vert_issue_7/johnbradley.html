      Parable of the Traveler from Qatar</FONT></B></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">John Bradley</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When I returned from Qatar,
      I told Minnie and Jump and Willow<BR>
      and Tiger. I told Winnie and Lincoln and Roundel and Klank. Who
      told<BR>
      the grocer, who told the mail carrier, who told the FBI, who
      told me:<BR>
      &quot;There is no such place as Qatar.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I can truthfully tell you, my
      friends, that there was and, I<BR>
      believe, still is a Qatar, though I have only this faint recollection:
<BR>
      A sleek city street with sleek, milky traffic and a large flashing
      sign<BR>
      that spoke in ninety-nine languages, telling all: &quot;Behold
      Qatar.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">House arrest has led me to discover
      a new career--water<BR>
      colorist. Each day the Inspector brings me my groceries and art<BR>
      supplies. He leaves with my new shopping list and with that day's<BR>
      intelligence report--a water-color scene of Qatar.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No matter if I paint my mother
      in a sombrero in Phoenix, or an<BR>
      old Finn snoring on a bus in Duluth, or bowing gas station attendants
      in<BR>
      white uniforms and white gloves in Hiroshima. All witness that<BR>
      ever-so-distant place called Qatar.</FONT></P>
