      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Your report ended, &quot;So
      far I've spent eleven hours looking for a call number and learned
      that bark is in no way equivalent to skin.&quot; I'd write an
      homage to Sterling A. Brown if I knew anything about the blues,
      I penciled in the margin, a retort to your idea of taping over
      a few of the holes before holding a flute in the wind. &quot;Only
      seven miles left,&quot; you said, handing me the book composed
      entirely of jacket-copy, convinced we'd written it together.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You couldn't understand why
      I'd decided to paste the letter, the one written in blue ink
      over a section of the map detailing the topography of our internal
      river, onto my bedroom wall. Perhaps it was because they kept
      pushing my bowl just out of reach. Your quote about the death
      of Romanticism was scrolling across the bottom of the screen.
      A cult of beauty is nearer our reliance on clocks, at least that's
      what I meant to say when the wind picked up and the sound of
      the leaves crowned out the words appearing as you spoke them,
      your lips locked in some perverted pantomime.</FONT></P>
