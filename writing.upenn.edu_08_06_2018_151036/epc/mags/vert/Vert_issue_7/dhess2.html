      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Who would deny a perfect absent
      guy?<BR>
      who's never around (can't make you cry)<BR>
      he could be straight or could be gay<BR>
      in either case, he'll do as you say</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A mess he'll clear up<BR>
      without even appearing<BR>
      he'll write you a check<BR>
      (you can count on it clearing)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Is he your dad or your brother?<BR>
      your husband or your lover?<BR>
      he's perfect absent guy<BR>
      this man's like no other</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">For instance: he would not hide<BR>
      diamond rings on his golden body<BR>
      and think it so goshdarn funny<BR>
      for this he knows you would not care<BR>
      (you would have to look in places<BR>
      that had yet to greet the air)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Stress-free and no conditions<BR>
      he'll walk your parakeet and do the dishes<BR>
      take out the trash without your asking<BR>
      and leave a Thank You note,<BR>
      now that's multi-tasking!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He'll be there when you want
      him<BR>
      bringing roses plus protection<BR>
      for if a thorn punctures a Trojan<BR>
          he'll toss it in a jiffy<BR>
      selecting instead<BR>
      a Shared Sensation jimmy</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If you're cold, he'll give you
      his sweater<BR>
      if you're hot, he's programmed to make you wetter<BR>
      someday he'll wake you with kisses<BR>
      lull you to sleep with verses and caresses<BR>
      but not today or tomorrow (that'd be much too quick)<BR>
      were he to knock on your door<BR>
          unannounced<BR>
      and catch you minus your Monday morning bounce</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Every dance you can expect him
      to know<BR>
      from the bossa nova to the lively tango<BR>
      from the two step to the fandango<BR>
      stepping on toes is not in his vocabulary<BR>
      catch him in a split-<BR>
      that's when to ask him to marry</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">(But search as you might<BR>
      behind the curtains in your night<BR>
      his face is a picture<BR>
      his heart an admixture<BR>
      of Mad Libs and Scripture)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He's funny and sincere<BR>
      gets along with every peer<BR>
      never to take up more space<BR>
      than a few shelves in the closet<BR>
      between your pumps<BR>
      and matching leg brace</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Perfect absent guy, he does<BR>
      everything right<BR>
      too bad it's not enough<BR>
      his silhouette looks scrawny<BR>
      and you requested buff</FONT></P>
