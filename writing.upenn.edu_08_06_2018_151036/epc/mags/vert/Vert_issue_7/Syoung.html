      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Some of the planes still sound
      too loud for me, even though they say you get used to it, after
      a while you don't hear BART if it runs through your backyard
      like in North Berkeley and West Oakland. Is there a difference,
      doing it on the keyboard? I'm not even over my allotment of cigarettes
      for the day and I'm starting to get an idea this isn't the best
      way to quit. I've got my furtive relationship with smoking back
      again. It's not that enjoyable and I worry about my legs going
      bad, the problem I learned about tonight in yoga class, how great
      pain might result from the continued use of an object after its
      intention or spiritual quality has already been fulfilled. Like
      you can use a backbend over and over again but not a cigarette.
      I worry about the poem getting exhausted. Last night I made chicken
      curry sandwiches on an oblong square of crustless bread, Iron
      Kids for kids who hate crust but adults can put chicken curry
      between the bread and then cut the sandwich into four neat triangles
      and not feel totally disgusting eating sandwiches at their desk.
      Lunch is ruining my keyboard. The idea of ditching work for the
      movies has inspired in me a great rash of work. I like the movies
      too and television if I can lie on the floor when I watch it.
      I like wearing your black hoody with your name on the chest like
      a workman or a boxer. When you were a boy with your brothers,
      you called dress socks businessmens and so if I'm seized with
      a real desire to smell your socks or your feet as they come out
      of them, the <I>businessmens</I> I say because it sounds elegant
      or old fashioned but it's only a sock that's been worn by a man,
      and a way of wanting to smell it. This is not an effect I'm trying
      for. Your hoody is soft on the inside and I think of it as French
      terry, not to be washed with zippers or buckles, while I wait
      on the phone for dinner reservations. I move the props around,
      hoody, sutra, they are husks I am trying to get onto my body
      instead of sloughing off. The worst part in all of this is admitting
      to the self that it's the self which is unmanageable, myself
      I guess not like drinks or drugs or sex although I have this
      deep understanding of cigarettes. <I>Nothing outside can cure
      you but everything's outside. </I>If the poem can really be composed
      of trash I intend to test this. Real trash: I put a cigarette
      out first on the sidewalk in front of Elizabeth's house and then
      again after the reading in the gravel of her driveway because
      I'm in fear of lighting fires in the trashcan. Just Doolittle
      over and over again and a bad recording in the car and the car
      covered all over in birdshit. Empty cups of yogurt in the black
      plastic tub of trash that sits by my desk at the office and keeps
      me from crawling under the desk and sleeping there every afternoon,
      like Deborah in HR at my first office job. I finished off the
      beautiful cherries in a rapid hog style at the end of the reading,
      I could talk to the poets from Portland because they seemed made
      up here on their imaginary road trip with sweet high voices and
      black glasses. I was struck down by sleep then and poets were
      passing by afterwards arranging type by hand. I was a child who
      only wanted to talk about the vagaries of Mt. Rushmore. Seeing
      you late at night all the time is great this time around, always
      in pajamas or laying on the floor. I try hard all the time to
      make long range plans, beyond sandwiches and to thoughtfully
      consider what appears to be my career of assistant, and failing
      to introduce myself at readings even when asked very nicely via
      email. I want to run into the wall of the social like a glass
      egg, not to say there is a toy or surprise at the center or that
      for my self I'd employ the same metaphor so often used upon me
      earlier to explain about the trinity, and the spirit, and the
      shell which holds it all together even when blown out through
      a safety pin sized hole. All day today and some of yesterday
      I waited for 2:15 so that I could leave the office and go to
      the movies with you. In an email to Sabrina, I wrote <I>I'm playing
      hooky </I>and then realized I don't know how to spell hooky,
      and that either way it sounds like a nickname for hooker. Del's
      poem calls a cigarette white, which kills me as though he had
      described a new hybrid fruit, even though they actually are white,
      the paper and the smoke as well smoke is just smoke but still,
      I would never call them white, maybe that's the painful part:
      to look past the image of a thing so that I can obsess about
      its function. In the movie, Andy Goldsworthy's egg shaped pile
      of rocks, I'm sorry but I can't describe it any better than that,
      rose from the beach a little further each time in proportion
      he said to his understanding of the stone and the beach he was
      building them on. I'm doomed, I feel cheerful about it. Writing
      that keeps falling on the page for lack of balance. Andy has
      a quiet way of saying <I>shit</I> with his hands behind his head
      and then the tide which is relentless. I got to work early this
      morning and stayed late last night so that I could leave early
      I guess that's not playing hooker. The morning meeting got pushed
      out of shape into the afternoon and I said yes to a whole list
      of things out of sheer desperation it was getting past 2:15.
      In the car I was late and Doolittle sang about whores in your
      bed and I was starting to sweat because you were already mad
      and thinking I'm always late, I called some of the other drivers
      names, especially when I got stuck on Shattuck Ave., I said <I>Fucker!
      </I>more than once and even to myself I seemed ashamed, I was
      glad no one heard me on my way to the movies. But Andy didn't
      say a thing about how he always collects so many of one material,
      like all the dandelions on the lane to float in a stone hole
      on the river, they're everywhere in Scotland in the movie. Doesn't
      this say something about depletion? As nervous as I've been about
      my legs and making a series of lateral moves which will wind
      up in what used to be called a boarding house in novels a studio
      I guess, a kitchenette, and probably still smoke cigarettes and
      eat sandwiches or bran muffins and then have no money, at the
      movies I thought I couldn't wait to get old. There were crowds
      of old people really elderly ones in pairs at the movies at 2:45
      on a Tuesday afternoon. Nobody looks at you when you're that
      old and then I won't mind, I love the movies. I can have an apple
      for my mouth, too, between engagements. <BR>
