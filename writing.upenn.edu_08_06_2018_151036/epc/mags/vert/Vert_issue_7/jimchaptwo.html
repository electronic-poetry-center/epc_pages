      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">After agreeing on the day<BR>
      there was plenty of time to rehearse<BR>
      what to wear, what to say; lunch<BR>
      and exploratory conversation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But when the day came <BR>
      it was blocked <BR>
      by a lock of brown hair,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">a lock of hair chestnut brown,<BR>
      mahogany, childlike<BR>
      across a smooth forehead.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A lock of hair: a desert, a
      mountain range.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Across that wide desert, those
      mountains-<BR>
      a pleasant land where cattle grazed<BR>
      and peasants labored in the golden light,<BR>
      a country for which no visa had been issued.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If only that lock of hair <BR>
      had been some other color.<BR>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Jim Chapson was born in Honolulu
      where his grandfather used to play poker with David Kalakaua.
      He now lives in Milwaukee, and has been described perceptively
      by Kent Johnson as &quot;completely unknown.&quot;<BR>
