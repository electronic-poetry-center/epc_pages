      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Words take forms we don't
      always recognize. The actual experience of language grows from
      our own pulse. Sometimes I sense it so clearly, that we are mediums,
      and that we must seek out the words in ourselves, that we may
      gather knowledge of the land, our feet, distant cities or the
      touch of friends. There is a thought of architecture we inherit,
      a willing form...</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In this passage near the beginning
      of <I>The Flood and the Garden</I> (First Intensity), writing
      of William Carlos Williams, Dale Smith addresses poetic orders
      of the highest magnitude, the art of charging words with sense
      and feeling, of distilling experience directly into an energy
      that can then be transferred, a la Charles Olson, from poem to
      reader. But he also touches on the dilemma that all modern poets,
      perhaps starting with Williams, face:</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Who knew better the drudgery
      of work, and the sheer will and effort needed to free the imagination...
      The flat cold mornings wrapped him up, the car defrosting in
      the driveway while he lingered, just a moment, thumbing a yellow
      notebook. Then off to the miserable Rutherford sick. He addressed
      the poem as he could, attendant to the day and its unknown content.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Smith writes here of the poet
      who chose to stay and work as Doctor in rural America rather
      than live as Artist in Paris, like his contemporary Ezra Pound.
      His poems, then, refracted through the duties his work entailed,
      famously scribbled on prescription pads, observations of the
      sick and broken-down or still-spirited poor he treated, incisive
      as a surgeon's knife but terse as a pathological report.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It is no wonder that a modern
      poet, especially one so rooted to his own America and caught
      in the same worklife dilemma of balancing artistic and practical
      realities, would turn to Williams as a model. American life has
      changed the nature of time, our gas and gadgets speeding the
      pace of life to an ever-increasing velocity, downing distance
      in bigger and bigger gulps. There is less and less room for anyone
      who doesn't get with the program of Empire, and the artist has
      always been regarded as little more than roadkill on the superhighway
      of commerce and economy. It's a strange sort of taboo to speak
      about this today, as if one were taking the role of &quot;victim,&quot;
      but Pound wasn't embarrassed to write of the antipathy Americans
      have to supporting their artists in the early part of this century,
      and as recently as 1967 Lew Welch complained, in his essay &quot;Bread
      vs. Mozart's Watch,&quot; of having to work long hours on a fishing
      boat to support himself. &quot;Nobody expects a carpenter to
      have to find work as a poet,&quot; his reasoning ran, &quot;why
      should a poet have to work as a carpenter?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">All of which is an odd way to
      begin to talk about this sensual, sensitive book, which has little
      to do directly with this issue. But it's worth noting that Williams,
      who toughed out this condition almost 100 years ago without retreating
      into the academy or expatriation, would naturally appeal to the
      stubborn sensibilities of Smith, so tied to his native Texas
      and determined to find those words &quot;in himself,&quot; in
      his own way, on his own terms. While the book seldom touches
      the struggle directly, the things that are real to Smith -- the
      odor of plants and herbs on the warm Texas air, the curve of
      his lover's skin, the truths of poetry, expressed in flashes
      of insight while going about the busy-ness of his day -- speak
      to it far more poignantly than outright argument could.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Anyone who has ever tried to
      keep a &quot;daybook&quot; knows what a difficult task this is,
      how much of everyday life seeps under the bridge of consciousness
      like a fast-flowing stream. How hard it is to pause, dip into
      the rush of words feelings images, and emerge day in and day
      out with something sustained and cohesive. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Another model Smith takes is
      Kerouac's &quot;goofbooks,&quot; some of which I've had the pleasure
      of perusing in the New York Public Library's Berg Collection.
      Those raw, five-cent notebooks, filled with long rhapsodic episodes
      of life, the flash and hustle of New York and San Francisco,
      gush with Kerouac's ecstatic vision and characteristic &quot;speed&quot;
      of detail. (Most of them later finding their way intact into
      his freeform novels.) But Smith in some ways stands against that
      speed, constantly working to slow his pulse, to &quot;hold on
      to the question&quot; as he writes on p. 39, to steep his observations
      in silence and a tender reflectiveness. In tone and pace they
      more closely resemble Elias Canetti's <I>Notes from Hampstead</I>
      and German writer Peter Handke's <I>The Weight of the World</I>,
      both of which provide a window into the mind of a working author,
      full of notes on reading material and chatty asides describing
      interactions with friends and lovers, where ideas are every bit
      as real as the people who move through the pages, the speed internal,
      the passages brief.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">For Smith, the vicissitudes
      of his reading might hit as hard as a Texas thunderstorm, a line
      in a poem felt as deeply as the bulge of his son in his partner's
      belly. All of it gets jumbled together, connections shooting
      between inner and outer world, a stern and steady attention to
      his observations and where they lead him, not only knowing but
      as Gertrude Stein wrote &quot;knowing himself knowing it.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A good example is the short
      bit entitled &quot;Rats,&quot; page 41. Spotting a midnight rat
      migration through his kitchen window, fragments of texts float
      up to Smith's consciousness, and he flits from Geofrey Hartman
      to William Blake to Jack Clark in barely the space of a paragraph,
      which in turn leads him to a rumination on animal sacrifice:
      &quot;It's the use of sensation as it gnaws with the mind to
      center the attention that most consumes, and burns out, into
      a single smoky victim... the Karankawans cooked rat whole, and
      gnawed the small prey like State Fair corn dogs.&quot; This ritual-alchemical
      musing then breaks into a realization that &quot;Meaning is not
      given to the world about us, but derived from it... Words aren't
      thoughts but ideas in things, and poets attend not what they
      mean to say but how what they say means.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Elsewhere, longer passages allow
      the half-hidden narrative of daily life to emerge, as names and
      places pop up again and again, giving the contour of a life devoted
      to poetry but tempered by the realities of living it -- getting
      by working crummy gigs, arguing with fool and friend alike, battling
      snails in his garden, awaiting the birth of his son.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Something stank in the pantry,
      made me gag. A sweet potato gummed up in a dark corner. I tossed
      it into the trash, but the goo stuck, gagging me as I sponged
      it. Hoa told me she'd clean it, assuming some guilt in this.
      'Don't worry about it,' I said. 'I'll take care of it.' 'No,
      she said, 'Let me do it.' Words escalated. 'Fuck it,' I said,
      'clean the fucking shit then.' She scrubbed, her belly bulging
      in black space. More words exchanged. She charged me with insulting
      her, abusing her 'condition.' 'Fuck your goddamn condition,'
      I said. At that hot tears hit cheeks in the early light. She
      stormed to the bathroom. I followed, pushing open the door. 'How
      could you say that,' she said, cat hair at our feet.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This anonymous entry from page
      77, pathetic almost to the point of comic absurdity in its mundane,
      domestic testiness, shows the dark side of that life with its
      undertow of frustrations. That Smith is willing to present such
      moments without wheedling comment or explanation only balance
      the greater thrust of his emotions. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">From page 19:</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I've come to women against
      my knowledge, all my life, and through them have earned some
      place of my own in myself. Hoa, dancing in blue dress at Sean
      and Deborah's wedding, seemed to me then, a most beautiful woman.
      This is not some sentimental projection but a fact of her body
      and its effect on me. The young Korean woman also appealed to
      my senses, but knowledge rose to my skin with the steps of Hoa.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This passage points to the other
      narrative that moves underneath the narrative of the every day,
      involving Smith's growing sense of his place as poet, his feeling
      of &quot;someone outside me looking in&quot; (page 76), or through,
      the urge to &quot;Get me out of the way,&quot; in an almost Spicerian
      sense. In this context, miniature essays on Williams, snatches
      of Paul Blackburn or Robert Duncan or D.H. Lawrence, tales from
      myth re-imagined as Smith works in his own &quot;garden,&quot;
      ground the text in its central images of the flood and the garden,
      weaved in so seamlessly that they never seem like a slapped-on
      framework for what is, after all, only a daybook.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It <I>is</I> a daybook, after
      all, and the juiciest pleasure comes from that mysterious fleshy
      outline that Smith reveals, like a flash of skin on a hot summer
      day. The feeling of heat and sweat of Austin, the smells of herbs,
      the echoing laughter of friends -- and the insights of an eager
      mind moving underneath and through them all. </FONT></P>
