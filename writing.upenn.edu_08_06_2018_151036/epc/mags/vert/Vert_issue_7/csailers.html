        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Small faces lined above the
        hierarchical sea.<BR>
        The way of breaking up music on a calm <BR>
        Morning. It is as if one says, there are no <BR>
        Blue bananas until we paint one. <BR>
        The new yellow curtains are meant to be a sign.<BR>
        Where spit bugs have doppled their official headlines:<BR>
        You always want to buy her a cake for her birthday <BR>
        And you don't always wait till she asks you.<BR>
        As with Bugs Bunny &quot;you are getting sweepy&quot;<BR>
        Chasing wild game. A painting on both sides,<BR>
        We walked down these hallways. The only method <BR>
        Is war now that we are no longer ourselves <BR>
        Or the comedian of this picture. I'd like to share<BR>
        A moment with you who paints for me <BR>
        What might be different. I can't explain it. <BR>
        From childhood too much matters. <BR>
        A woman and her double view the image <BR>
        Overhead. We do not question the source <BR>
        Like where the paint cans come from. Or the water, <BR>
        The lake in the corner of the diorama.<BR>
        The public must continue with naturalism. <BR>
        Across a map of countries yet to come <BR>
        I think there is a salad bar, your argument,<BR>
        Has nothing to do with ideology. If she paints the sea,<BR>
        The seascape had better be forgotten.</FONT></P>
