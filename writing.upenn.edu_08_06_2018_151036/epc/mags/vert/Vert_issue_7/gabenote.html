      Great day teaching at ISU today except for the one kid hunched
      at his desk: the sand-dollars of sleep hanging under his eyes
      kept clacking in the small breezes of his mouth weather. I woke
      him and explained that eye-sleep constitutes a type of guano.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">Jazz is pervert music. Maurice
      Scharton died two days ago. I did not know him many people spoke
      of his pigtail.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">Buicks. These cars are for
      white elder couples. The Buick design-engineers of the late 1980s
      modeled their conveyances upon Ethan Allen furniture. The model
      straining to pass my efficient Toyota resembles a teak coffee
      table. That Ohio Buick is occupied by people who appear to be
      Christians with very loose skin. A coffee table on wheels driven
      by a pair of coasters.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">Shoulder smeared with the
      meat-frosting of an antelope. Up inside the antelope one sees
      blood and feces and chemicals frozen under the horns. One sees
      bubbles in the eyes, the flight of the brown-red eggs. I see
      all of this while passing the ripped carcass at 70 miles an hour.
      At this speed my vehicle will achieve 46 miles per gallon. At
      62 miles an hour I achieve 50 miles per gallon if I don,t use
      the air conditioner.</FONT></P>

      at her breasts was like spending 2 nights inside a kazoo.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">East of Akron, out of tedium,
      I begin to sing &quot;Slowly balding, slowly balding, slowly
      balding,<BR>
      You are slowly balding and your children are balding apace. <BR>
      No one else in the world is balding except your family. Wife
      is balding.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">The vaginas of your women
      are blen,<BR>
      the penises of your men are shrung,<BR>
      shrungen, balden, stretchle wife. Your family is really bald
      and stretched out now.<BR>
      Soon your children bald will go off to college balden, shrungen,
      stretchle.<BR>
      Bald, slowly slowly bald. Balding slowly. Slowly shrung. Ooh
      shadoobay.&quot; The sun sets beneath Akron.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">I do not know why I have sung
      this, except to remember that when driving long distances a person
      enters a kind of snakedance psychosis and I really do feel at
      this point like I have been rewired with the ligaments of a baboon.
      In the twilight, bird almost hits windshield, cartwheels off
      in the slipstream. It is a matter of natural record that a stork
      can deliver its own enema. Your mother's meatloaf looked like
      stonehenge that night. She set it right down there between the
      butter plate and the jam tray, the meatloaf so hard and cold
      a baby fog settled over the dinnerware. The stonehenge meatloaf
      lay there in its miniscule immensity. There was embarrassed silence
      for your mother. I stood up and slowly undid my buckle, I bent
      over and wishing to please your mother, placed a small wedge
      of meatloaf between the cheeks of my buttocks. I smiled and said,
      &quot;This tastes very good.&quot; Somehow this caused an uproar.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">I believe I have written things
      that can get me arrested/fired/or beaten. Life is to be dealt

      Rd 533 Brookville. &quot;I got a peaceful easy feeling.&quot;
      What if The Lord hid your soul in the fundament of a hen and
      you chose to recover it after finding out which hen contained
      it? How would you proceed? Or say your soul is lodged in a goat
      lipand you have identified the goat in question. Do you call
      a chaplain or a person of medical lip knowledge. Now that I am
      employed I hope I can avoid the direct attention of psychiatrists.

      to sleep, tilt seat back fall asleep seat belt on, wake 4:30
      AM Eastern time, pee and drive.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">My advice is demonstrate incompetence
      in everything you do. Demonstrate incompetence in every feature
      of your personality. Ineffective people are left alone to do
      their work. If you are incompetent you cannot be improved upon.
      What's more, truly independent beings are incompetent by design.
      For instance now I am in New Jersey, the geese here are collectively
      independent. Look here are some now, they are refusing to fly
      in V's and W's. They are flying in P's and O's.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">Business ideas: Collect underwear
      of the elderly and infirm and from them make thin, urinous quilts.
      Sell brilliant typos: 5 to 10 dollars depending upon whether
      the typo is a spoonerism, inadvertant acronym, Freudian slip
      (e.g., Kent becomes Kunt) or nonsense. Nonsense costs the most.
      I think that you've got an inadvertant acronym there in which
      case that's 7 dollars. I take PayPal. g</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">The succeeding is my response
      to a fellow driver in mid Connecticut. Earnest Driver I am putting
      the end of a wrench in your navel, am putting the concomitant
      pain of a duck in each of your heels, a half a duck,s pain to
      either heel , a full duck,s pain to the pair of your feet. Into
      your knees I am depositing the pain of a goose, into your hip
      loins I apply the pain of an emu, into your chest I lodge the
      sufferings of an ostrich, and onto the top of your head, in the
      chakra of reason, I place the hurt of an irritated hummingbird,
      just a fleck of pea-pain goes there to ensure that you did not
      stop feeling pompous.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">Your obvious bosoms reach
      outward. Many prows and ships come to us like your breasts, by
      two,s. Many ships do however come by three,s and four,s. The
      point being your obvious bosoms reach outward substantially bearing
      the cargo of your nipples. I have put my drafts and versions
      on your bosoms, but the wind blew them off. I eschewed the top
      of your head as a place to put my versions as there is a heavy
      weather out of your mouth. I adore you. This rattletrap of a
      dock adores you, and the old hard fish under this rigid dock
      adores you. I the rigid dock am sailing to rendezvous with the
      entire fleet of your body parts, each part bearing its cargo
      of boobies. And I am the dock am bearing my rigidity, my rigid
      wood, my immense creosote members, my masculine pylons and stiffened
      beams. I adore you you adore you. Life is to be dealt with over
      and over.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">On top of your baby, I put
      a flat baby. The flat baby is sorrowful and smells of old wings.
      I am trying to extinguish your baby with a flat baby. Suffering
      is conservative. Endurance is progressive. Life is to be dealt
      with over and over. Ooh shadoobay.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Garamond">I shall garland you with the
      epigraphs of far away books. And failing that, kiss you.</FONT></P>
