      <P>The poems translated here are not meant to contribute to the
      already substantial body of Lorca translations in English. I
      translated portions of <I>Poet in New York </I>for my own amusement
      and study. I also began an interlinear investigation or continuation
      of some of the images found here. In a sense, this is a trans-Atlantic
      collaboration across great spaces. </P>
      <P>Garcia Lorca's 1929 arrival in New York City might be considered
      beside the 1527 shipwreck of Cabeza de Vaca off the coast of
      Texas. Their writing-conceived in drastic contrast-relates narratives
      of their independent New World encounters. Separated in time
      by nearly 400 years, both men still shared a poetics of encounter
      consisting of awkward physical landscapes, alien cultural environments
      and inventive survival arts. While Cabeza de Vaca certainly faced
      an experience remarkable for its physical intensity, (he spent
      nine years in primitive conditions), Lorca arrived to alien shores
      in the midst of economic upheaval. (Strangely, we might pause
      to consider how economy acts as the vessel of spirit in America).
      That autumn in Manhattan, bodies flew from windows as fortunes
      failed on the stock exchange. An era of optimism transposed in
      a moment to failure, pessimism and desperation. Lorca, with little
      English, witnessed that modern city with the sensitivity of a
      bewildered stranger. Peasant relations to fields and villages
      were obscured for him by Modernity's systematic chill. The verticality
      of New York's avenues, its exquisite motion and exhausting masquerade
      of forms fed his Earth-bound inwardness. I hope my translations
      preserve a sense of the alien perception of images in his work.</P>
      <P>My own uses of this text were inspired by curiosity and delight
      in Lorca's extraordinary, image-rich language. It was my desire
      to enter those images directly. My interlinear projections also
      were conceived in the spirit of listening, though often discordance
      proved to me its artful purpose. <BR>
