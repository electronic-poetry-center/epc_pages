        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We sailed from Portsmouth toward<BR>
        the Northern Lights in 1987<BR>
        but once we hit the high seas the jib ripped<BR>
        and we found the ship was rigged.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In my mind I heard the sound<BR>
        of a cat eating paper in another room,<BR>
        for I was uncomfortable with our sense of lostness,<BR>
        or more so with my sense of incompetence to the task.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I crawled down into the captain's
        cabin<BR>
        and flipped off the Macintosh and sat<BR>
        there, as rain gusted from faraway ports,<BR>
        and somewhere cupboard doors banged.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Broken, broken, I cried.<BR>
        Then I prayed, and my spirit developed <BR>
        wings of fire, and all my disciples <BR>
        gathered around me. &quot;Men,&quot; I began.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;We need to get home. Someone
        grab me a 7-UP.<BR>
        Wallace?&quot; Immediately the very men<BR>
        I half-distrusted clicked into action<BR>
        as though sovereignly predestined to do so,</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Wallace to the Coke machine,
        Thomas<BR>
        to lock the cupboards, and Brent to the crow's nest.<BR>
        That was a wonderful morning I'll not soon forget,<BR>
        though since then I have become buried</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">in grief again, sprawled on
        a futon in a ramshackle<BR>
        flat in Portsmouth, dishwasher gurgling,<BR>
        dryer ticking, and the answering machine blinking<BR>
        its little heart out. Perhaps it is Laura</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">reminding me we have tickets
        to &quot;Follies on Ice&quot;<BR>
        tonight at the ArenaDome. Maybe Sid will join us.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
