      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">what happens when a day is gray
      and you want all the thin envelopes to come back with acceptance
      letters and you would go out and do something like visit your
      girlfriend or read at the stanford bookstore cafe except that
      your right eye is half closed and you can only half open it what
      is at risk there nothing in the light of your desk lamp yet edward
      hirsch is always writing blurbs saying this poet or that is &quot;risky&quot;
      or has a kind of &quot;riskiness&quot; as if it takes courage
      or guts to sit in front of a keyboard like any data entry clerk
      c'mon edward it's just words and it's not like you're entering
      the ring with a wwf champion or something like that how risky
      can you get and molly giles once told me writers were timid thus
      we make up wild stories and barbara jane reyes said she's quiet
      so her poems are waterfalls listen don't stop don't stop writing
      that's my ars poetica or was it lyn heijinian's ? i forget i
      wrote this on the back of a napkin while lunching in san diego
      do you believe that one i wrote this after making love to the
      most beautiful woman on the planet at her writing table downstairs
      the rosewood one that's horizontally long and vertically short
      i wrote this at any rate and it has not been &quot;written&quot;
      yet at any rate do you believe that one i found a found poem
      by the side of a curb and published it under an alias andrew
      felsinger so a.f. if you find your name in an east coast lit
      zine you know who submitted that poem </FONT></P>
