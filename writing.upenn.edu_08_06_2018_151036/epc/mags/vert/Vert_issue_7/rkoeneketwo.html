      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have seen Grandma's secretion's.<BR>
      I have dressed in Auntie's pantyhose.<BR>
      I have discussed gender issues with the sager of the amoebae<BR>
      In backstreets watched by swart gendarmes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have worked the alphabet at
      Mother's seances<BR>
      And chauffeured the local diva in a succession of teal minivans.<BR>
      I have wrapped the flag round pre-made Safeway sandwiches<BR>
      And placed chaise-lounges on the Maharani's private lawn.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have watched pacific oceans<BR>
      Disgorging their slimy wares.<BR>
      I have crammed foolscap with poems<BR>
      And suffered Euterpe's brisk stings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have traced the airplane's
      lemniscate<BR>
      Through lands very foreign to mine.<BR>
      I have called down distant objects from my airspace<BR>
      And in turn given boomerangs a lawn on which to land.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have brunched with stepmothers
      in strip clubs<BR>
      I have gazed on the scroll behind curtain # 3.<BR>
      I have dropped to my face during fire drills<BR>
      And uttered canned prayers to the Indian god of flame.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have dandled the lesser Muses
      on my knee<BR>
      I have lost the OED, my better half.<BR>
      I have sunburned beneath traffic lights<BR>
      And cooled under moons by the Bros. Lumiere.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have clasped hands with the
      former century<BR>
      And I, too, made my peace with fey Walt.<BR>
      I have placed ebon dildoes on the coffeetable<BR>
      For Mary to find out with the plumbs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have conjured orchestras with
      swizzle sticks,<BR>
      Picked up failed dates in airport bars.<BR>
      I have danced with singing girls in lean-to yurts<BR>
      And have heard duodecimal jazz from the vulval conch.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have collected brown envelopes
      from P.O. boxes<BR>
      And taught square dance at the local Sunday school.<BR>
      I have built a chocolate ziggurat of after dinner mints<BR>
      And eaten my way to its dark, funereal bowels.<BR>
      I have entertained a taste for Nembutal<BR>
      And find it weaker stimulant than sound Welsh tea.<BR>
      I have indulged a well-known lust for tummy tucks<BR>
      Then banged up my body like an unclaimed airport bag.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My foyer is dark with pink and
      womb-like silks.<BR>
      I keep the study gloomy as a grave. <BR>
      I resolve to make an ending. I politely decline to begin.<BR>
      Double yet sterile; beginning, I end.</FONT></P>
