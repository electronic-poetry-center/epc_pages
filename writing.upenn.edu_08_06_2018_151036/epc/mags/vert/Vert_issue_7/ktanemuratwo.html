      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">after reading this article on
      hank williams the third i mean it was so gorgeously written and
      it was all about this white trash redneck that even white people
      disdain yet it was epic an ode to hank a glamorized telling of
      this fake punk turned ghost of great grandaddy hank williams
      and so i thought okay i'm a journalist too just like 'liz gilbert
      so maybe i'll go over to hayward and do a story on joe nishimoto
      the japanese american dude who was a pro wrestler before the
      wwf was even established i heard this guy is a character and
      he has a brilliant garden in his yard i could do a 4 part feature
      and how dumb and groundbreaking and touch yet sensitive this
      joe nishimoto is and then i thought well who the fuck cares about
      joe nishimoto or anyone in the world named nishimoto poet alchemist
      of words we know why plato banished the wordsmiths but no power
      no metaphor no imagery no lyricism can make joe nishimoto into
      a &quot;story&quot; that folks can get into in America <BR>
