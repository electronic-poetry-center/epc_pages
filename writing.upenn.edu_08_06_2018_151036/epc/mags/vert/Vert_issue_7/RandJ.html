      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There is something extremely
      wrong with every single<BR>
      person in this world. They seem to be part of a<BR>
      pointless simulation.<BR>
<BR>
      &quot;The Matrix&quot; has portrayed this idea somewhat, yet
      we<BR>
      watch it and go back to our daily lives. Yet in this<BR>
      very life, underneath the seeming diversity in<BR>
      people's opinions, values, talents, and interests,<BR>
      there is something that makes everyone the same. It<BR>
      is as though this planet is populated only by mindless<BR>
      fakes, objects that provide the appearance of<BR>
      intellect on the surface but are based on only<BR>
      mechanical reflexes and primitive thought patterns.<BR>
<BR>
      I don't really care if anything I say has been said<BR>
      before, if it was portrayed in movies, in books, or in<BR>
      the lyrics of some useless song. With 6 billion people<BR>
      covering the globe at any given time, thousands and<BR>
      thousands of years of written literature, probability<BR>
      dictates almost any combination of words has occurred<BR>
      numerous times. Yet there is clear evidence there was<BR>
      no action, so those words, just like the people who<BR>
      spoke them, must have been just more fakes. I am<BR>
      forced to use this language (also created by the<BR>
      fakes) because there is no alternative, so everything<BR>
      I write here could be misunderstood to make me sound<BR>
      like one of them, but it will be the action that I<BR>
      take and the dedication that will separate me from<BR>
      them.<BR>
<BR>
      In my estimation the fakes that occupy this planet<BR>
      don't make up 99%, but more like 99.9999999% of the<BR>
      population. I know this because I've searched, and in<BR>
      my search have so far only found one true ally (I have<BR>
      found him via the internet as well). But even with<BR>
      those numbers we would not give up because there is no<BR>
      logic in giving up. <BR>
<BR>
      The people on this planet are all fakes because the<BR>
      societies have made them this way. Ideas that populate<BR>
      people's minds have no logic or purpose. Concepts such<BR>
      as religion, god, morality, individualism, freedom,<BR>
      identity, happiness, love and billions of others are<BR>
      all just memes. Like parasites they infect the minds<BR>
      and spread from one person to the next. They have no<BR>
      point or purpose; they exist without any logical basis<BR>
      or foundation. The fakes are completely controlled by<BR>
      them, and they will never see beyond them. To not be<BR>
      controlled by them one must do more then just realize<BR>
      that they exist. One must resist any ideas that have<BR>
      no point, endlessly question, and never accept<BR>
      imperfection or compromise in any answer.<BR>
<BR>
      We (myself and my ally) are different though. While we<BR>
      have had the limitation of existing only in these<BR>
      societies, something has made it possible for us to<BR>
      resist being indoctrinated into becoming one of those<BR>
      fakes. We have no arbitrary wants, needs, desires, or<BR>
      preferences. <BR>
<BR>
      If this world continues to exist the way it is then<BR>
      nothing in it will ever have a point. It will always<BR>
      be just a product of random evolution, one with no<BR>
      importance or relevance. The only logical goal is to<BR>
      dedicate our lives to increasing our numbers, those<BR>
      that aren't fakes, so that in thousands of years our<BR>
      numbers may be such that the fakes would no longer be<BR>
      a threat to progress.<BR>
<BR>
      Those that join us must see every other person<BR>
      occupying this planet as the enemy, and us as their<BR>
      only allies. Like us they must have dedication only to<BR>
      taking the most logical action, and to nothing else.</FONT></P>
