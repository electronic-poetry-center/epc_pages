      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Prosthesis of PomPom into
      VeRT</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This poem was submitted to PomPom
      magazine, with c.c. to Rod <BR>
      Smith, fine editor of Aerial (second magazine ever to publish
      work <BR>
      eventually appearing in Doubled Flowering: From the Notebooks
      of <BR>
      Araki Yasusada), to whose poem in PomPom # 1, &quot;Destrukticon
<BR>
      of the Unrenude,&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><A HREF="http://www.pompompress.com/PomPom_Issue1.pdf"><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">http://www.pompompress.com/PomPom_Issue1.pdf</FONT></A></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">it &quot;replies,&quot; made
      largely as it is of the &quot;Destrukticon's&quot; <BR>
      strange language. Smith courteously wrote back to me <BR>
      (despite suffering, he said, from jet lag and hangover), expressing
<BR>
      his enthusiastic approval. I wrote back to Rod and said, thanks
<BR>
      Rod!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But this is not the end of the
      story by a long shot, for not having <BR>
      had any word from the PomPom editors, I wrote a follow up query,
<BR>
      asking if they had received the poem. Did you get it? I asked.
<BR>
      Around a month or so later I finally received brief answer. It
      said <BR>
      thank you for sending, Kent. We'll get back to you in a few more<BR>
      months...</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Say what? A few more months?
      Well, unfortunately the doctors <BR>
      haven't given me that long, so with apoplogies to the PomPom
<BR>
      editors, I must move on...</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Therefore, PomPom, one might
      say, is now extended into VeRT (a <BR>
      magazine that responds to submissions with quite a bit more <BR>
      agility and verve), so that VeRT, in a way, is now partially
<BR>
      PomPom, a VeRT with a kind of poetic prosthesis inserted into
      its <BR>
      side. Looked at another way, PomPom is now partially VeRT, a
<BR>
      PomPom with a crystal catheter inserted into a cavity of its
      body.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And this, via poetry's magic,
      as it were, is so, and life, as Kenneth <BR>
      Koch said in his final poem, goes on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">--Kent Johnson</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">P.S. I do hope the PomPom editors
      will still include me in the table <BR>
      of contents of PomPom # 3. My suggestion would be that they <BR>
      simply provide a link with my name to this page of VeRT. (I greet
<BR>
      you, PomPom readers of the future, should you have crossed here!
<BR>
      Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt;<BR>
      just as any of you is one of a living and tiny sub-culture, I
      was one <BR>
      of a living and tiny sub-culture, too.)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <B>Getting It Good in a Loaded Time</B><BR>
<BR>
      People will always look up into a magnolia. <BR>
      It doesn't matter if the stars in the lookalike <BR>
      branches are just trace metals: the metals the<BR>
      reason is made of, the reason the heart gets<BR>
      raked again and again against the caseloaded <BR>
      &quot;me&quot;... Even under the spell of harsh twenty-<BR>
      year-old language hashish, even with desert-dry<BR>
      throats and stick-brittle bones, people will look up. <BR>
      They'll look up through the teepee's cone and rise <BR>
      into the blossoming reference book of the tree. And<BR>
      at the sign of &quot;don't,&quot; they'll almost always exhale,<BR>
      and go &quot;Ah.&quot;</FONT></P>
