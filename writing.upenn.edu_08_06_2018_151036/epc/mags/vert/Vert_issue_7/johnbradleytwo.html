      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Folding out from my stomach
      with ease and efficiency, the wooden<BR>
      chair makes its presence known without calling attention to itself.
<BR>
      Made of pine, it possesses only one of the necessary attributes
      of<BR>
      prized furniture: not great expense, but the requisite discomfort.
<BR>
      Still, I admire its clean features, its simpleminded trustworthiness.
<BR>
      Planting the chair's far legs onto the floor and backing away,
      I<BR>
      discover the chair expands to seat three, nine, a dozen, perhaps
      even<BR>
      twenty-four at a banquet table. Not that such casual use was
      intended<BR>
      by the chair's designer. No, a chair like this surely has some
      other,<BR>
      more celestial purpose, relating to the four seasons, or the
      four edible<BR>
      species of yarrow leaves, or the four positions for making love
      on the<BR>
      night before the full moon. But as it has no practical use, I
      fold it<BR>
      back into my stomach and lie back on my bed, the mattress stuffed
      with<BR>
      pages torn from books it is better not to allow to fever the
      brain. <BR>
      Along a beach, I dream I am strolling with my mother. Her belly
      bulges<BR>
      a little with her own collapsible chair, though neither of us
      can be<BR>
      bothered mentioning something so mundane.</FONT></P>
