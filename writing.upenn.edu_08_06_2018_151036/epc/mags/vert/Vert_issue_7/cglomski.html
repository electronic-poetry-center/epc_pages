      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What's your racket, February
      morning, spiller of slant-lit<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phosphorus in a ribbon of<BR>
      Windowshade just above the sill? Why it's pills! broad-spectrum<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doxycycline (&quot;Take one capsule by
      mouth,<BR>
      Twice daily&quot;) pills, alice blue, they match the hue<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of city garbage trucks advancing in the
      alley:<BR>
      Trash-boom-bang, crush goes the crusher, &quot;Might as well
      get up &amp; take my pill.&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between gulps of water, wondering, Are
      sparrows too subject<BR>
      To swollen throats? do bird-lungs brim phlegm: blat, hack,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hawk? &quot;I'm just not up to
      singing today.&quot;<BR>
      You and your short, though lengthening, winter days, I'm glad<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sparrows haven't taken you
      off,<BR>
      Morning. Atop the magnolia (budtipped?) they shrill and preen,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruling through joyous numbers,
      leaving a string<BR>
      Of starlings to a lone clothesline. If only to fly this coop,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break loose, to take you, morning,<BR>
      To have all of you, <I>en plein air</I> again, with intimacy
      to deepen<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these removed, though charm-bound
      sketches.<BR>
      I'm loathe to turn my bathrobe on you, though I should review
      these books.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many poems to read and yet<BR>
      So few to stamp a lasting impression as when your<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;black slash of power-wire pulls
      into<BR>
      Focus dormant chokecherry and deepens to lacquered planks<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zigzagging an empty landing, up
      and out<BR>
      To Saint Boniface's steeple pinned like an aigrette<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your flame-blue sky. Pigeons<BR>
      Erupt in it, saturnalia of rings, wheeling in orbits,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then vanish behind the lean-to:<BR>
      What a riot they've reappeared now they're gone again<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before I could finish this sentence.<BR>
      To be under such weather in February this morning feels like
      its own sentence<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no liquor til the medicine's finished)<BR>
      And yet it is leavened with the coming of noon stillness, the
      cat hops<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from his little yellow box, goes
      to<BR>
      Bowl and scratches the linoleum there. The fridge kicks up a
      song.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Beware, there's beer in there!&quot;<BR>
      Not to worry there are also stocks of Toblerone,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocher and white chocolate
      almond bark which<BR>
      You brought me in a little bag with handles, not you, morning,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are gone, but You whose<BR>
      Parents have just bought a farm in beautiful Virginia. What is<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happening there this time
      of year? The calendar<BR>
      They gave me informs &quot;Skunk cabbage up. Plant Lespedenza.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring peepers calling in
      wet areas.&quot;<BR>
      Clearly spring comes earlier there than here, but isn't that
      a<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sure sign it is on its way,
      and that I may<BR>
      Chase You soon again through greenspire lindens when the<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Botanic Garden blooms, where
      we may stop<BR>
      Ourselves in front of Ruby Madder, Star cluster, Cinnamon ferns,
      spirea,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and say goodbye to all of
      them again, just by gazing?<BR>
