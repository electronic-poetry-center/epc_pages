      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      first time I saw you you were twice your natural size. Double-fisting
      Roman candles. Non sunt in coeli quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk
      you were screaming. Wonky-eyed.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      have always had the power to elicit belief. Veritable rainmaker.
      Turn to p.93 to learn if you survive.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
      body was fit for publication. Together we murdered a janitor.
      Together we renamed minor constellations. I'm kidding I swear.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      just called you again. No answer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman"><BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
      multiple occasions. What the multiple occasions. Abstract: boy
      meets girl and falls asleep. From feminine of <I>kritikos</I>.
      A habit-forming silence. What have you done with your hair. You
      were my first fistula. Eminently pregnable adagio. Forgive me.
      Repeatedly. Retrospectively</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one
      senses the presence of the critic: at ballgames, bonfires, the
      one-story library. The saturnine beauty of sensing retrospectively.
      It too is lost on me.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Abstract: the moon moves through the birch pavilions. The body
      fills out its forms. A ceiling held together only by pressure.
      An uneventful life cut short by its lone event. Unwanted discharge.
      I decline.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intended
      for publication. Intended for wild commercial success. Intended
      to bruise a floating rib.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does
      one forgive the critic. The critic who cubes the jellied milk.
      Whose diet consists of marrow squash. Greek <I>kleitoridos</I>.
      Genitive of <I>kleitoris</I>. The critic by definition cannot
      forgive.</FONT></P>

      I too have a flatbed. Am he of the flat affect. Credibility gap.
      Spatial disorder. Of little faith. O Parthenogenesis</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledge
      the utter impotence of our medium. We are none of us Russian.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      hymn of irregular meter sung after the gradual. The critic is

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      had a breakthrough: I fell asleep. For the first time I saw you
      as if for the first time. All tissue suddenly erectile. O my
      critic. Cymose inflorescences of stars. Stars and starlight identical.
      But this was years ago. When stars were mentionable. Before the
      line went dead. <BR>
