      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">We present here three
      excerpts from Gibaydulina's drafts of <I>Spiritual Movements
      of the Future</I>. These three movements-the Conscience-keepers,
      Foam-brewers, and Gift-givers-are characteristic of the three
      primary positive transformations of Gibaydulina's negative atheistic
      patterns:<BR>
<BR>
      1) Humanism: conscience as the principle of moral self-regulation,
      in contrast to religious belief where human behavior is regulated
      by an external supernatural force;<BR>
      2) Materialism: a poetic vision of matter in its spiritual-symbolic
      density and richness, in contrast to the abstract, diluted visions
      of idealism;<BR>
      3) Communitarianism, with donatism as its manifestation: gift-giving
      as the mode of creative and individual exchange in contrast to
      the market-inspired &quot;circulation of commodities.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">CONSCIENCE-KEEPERS</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">. A spiritual movement bearing
      witness to &quot;the call of conscience.&quot; &quot;Conscience
      is neither religious nor atheistic; it is prior to this distinction.
      In some epochs, conscience moves people to religion, in others-to
      atheism. It is against conscience to live by the belly alone,
      but it is also against conscience to give God the responsibility
      for improving human life. Conscience is what moves people, prevents
      them from coming to rest either in bodily satisfaction or in
      passive prayerfulness.&quot; (Yu.M., &quot;The Tribunal of Conscience&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
      The Conscience-keepers disagree with both the Social-Moralists
      and the Existential-Moralists about the nature of morality. &quot;Conscience
      is not merely the right of free choice, but the responsibility
      for it before all of mankind. Existentialism claims the sovereignty
      of the individual above the masses, as represented by Sartre's
      saying, 'Hell is other people.' But, in truth, the 'masses' are
      present within each individual. The voice of conscience is 'the
      others' in me, all of mankind within a single man.&quot; (S.V.,
      &quot;Mass Existentialism&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
      One branch of the Conscience-keepers is called Chekhovism. This
      is an authentically atheistic (as opposed to antitheistic) worldview
      that gives supreme importance to the concept of &quot;decency.&quot;
      As D.Sh. puts it in &quot;The Ordinary Ones of This World&quot;:
      &quot;Not to deceive, not to betray, not to lie, not to pretend
      . . . This is the whole basis of all values. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky
      are far too insistent and grandiose, always addressing us either
      in a scream or a beyond-the-grave whisper. Pushkin's voice rings
      clear, of course, but it's somehow <I>too</I> smooth and harmonious.
      The real ideal is Chekhov, precisely because he was afraid of
      all ideals and couldn't endure the very word 'ideal.' It's in
      Chekhov that we can recognize the true measure of man: neither
      a god nor a slave, neither a king nor a servant, but simply himself,
      simply a human being. It is said that 'Man is the measure of
      all things,' but what is the measure of man himself? Ordinariness!
      Neither to rule nor to obey, neither to swagger nor to grovel.
      This is the teaching we find in Chekhov: fortitude, but not invulnerable;
      sensitivity, but not lachrymose. This is why we call this ideal
      'decency,' in the sense of being neither great nor small, neither
      above nor below, but within the ordinary proportions of men.
      Courage, but not to the point of harshness; modesty, but not
      to the point of cowardice-a constant process of self-correction,
      canceling out all extremes for the sake of the golden mean. Chekhov
      is our own home-grown Aristotle. This calm and dignified Chekhovian
      bearing is what is needed by the Russian people. They have been
      run ragged by the demands of their civil and ecclesiastical authorities
      to 'struggle for greatness' or to 'sink into humility' But who,
      after all that, will be left to be ordinary?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">FOAM-BREWERS</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">. A spiritual movement that
      arose from the ranks of the so-called &quot;Beer Party,&quot;
      formed in 1995 with the slogan &quot;Beer is the best policy,&quot;
      which the Foam-brewers replaced with &quot;Beer is the new metaphysics.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      &quot;Foam is the perfect state of matter, the play of liquid
      with air and light. As symbolically expressed in the myth of
      Aphrodite's birth, it was foam that gave rise to life in the
      beginning, and from foam a new spiritual universe will arise
      in the end of days.&quot; (V.M., &quot;Foam of Ages&quot;) <BR>
<BR>
      The Foam-brewers trace their doctrine to certain discoveries
      of contemporary vacuum physics, according to which the universe
      consists of foamy waves of nothingness. The Soviet physicist
      K.P. Stanyukovich compared the universe to an ocean full of little
      bubbles-but instead of an ocean of water, it is an ocean of emptiness,
      a gravitational vacuum. Matter itself is a bubbly brew in an
      ocean of emptiness, and spirit, a bubbly brew in an ocean of
      matter. This process of world-fermentation is the source of all
      energy and the spring of cosmic evolution. <BR>
<BR>
      The Foam-brewers are conscious participants in this process.
      In their terminology, &quot;brewing foam&quot; means stirring
      up the heavy lower layers of matter, bringing them up to the
      surface where they can be touched by air and light. Foam is the
      prototype of the final transfiguration of the world. There seems
      to be a contradiction among ancient sources, some saying the
      world will end in a new flood, others in an all-consuming fire.
      But perhaps both prophecies are true, and will be truly understood
      only when the future world turns out to be an ecstatic foam of
      fire and water.<BR>
<BR>
      Beer, of course, produces the best and thickest foam, the truly
      royal foam; but other kinds of foam are not to be sneezed at.
      In principle, any substance can be induced to foam, and Foam-brewers
      experiment with the possibilities in a growing number of specialized
      fermenting studios where they produce foams of sugar, flour,
      birchbark, raspberries, etc., each with its own characteristic
      color and index of refraction. For guidance, Foam-brewers look
      to materials such as sponges, laces, and snow-all types of porous,
      permeable, or leaky substances. Their task is to rarify each
      thing as far as possible and then whip it up into a thick foam
      or, as they put it in the ancient treatises, &quot;make a cradle
      for Aphrodite.&quot; . . .</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">GIFT-GIVERS</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">. A spiritual movement that
      considers ordinary gift-giving a type of sacrificial offering.
      Gift-givers devote their lives to thinking up gifts and presenting
      them to all their acquaintances-sometimes even to strangers,
      for &quot;a gift from the blue is a double gift.&quot; In their
      view, every thing is a potential gift and every person a potential
      recipient; the discipline of Gift-giving lies in matching up
      the qualities of the things with those of the people.<BR>
<BR>
      &quot;True Gift-givers are capable of the most harmonious orchestration
      of the interactions between people and things, suggesting the
      perfection our world would have if only each person got what
      he truly needed and each thing were owned by someone who could
      make the most perfect use of it. This sort of elective affinity
      between people and things cannot receive full expression in purchase,
      because a person negotiating a purchase is closed in on himself,
      while a person receiving a gift is open to the giver.&quot; (E.A.,
      &quot;The Art of the Gift&quot;) Of course, there are mechanisms
      of exchange for the coordination of people and things, but they
      regulate only the impersonal quantity and price of goods without
      reference to the actual people involved. When a thing is made
      a gift, it acquires a personal quality that it could never have
      had as merchandise. Merchandise is exchangeable, but a gift is
      a gift only when it is given to its intended recipient. <BR>
<BR>
      &quot;By uniting the individualities of the giver and the receiver,
      the gift becomes a symbol in the literal, unsymbolic sense of
      the term. In ancient Greek, &quot;symbols&quot; were the two
      parts of an unevenly broken object which, when matched, could
      testify to the relationship of friends or relatives. In religion,
      art, and poetry, the term &quot;symbol&quot; has taken on a purely
      conventional sense, which barely hints at that original union
      of two individuals through the medium of a unique thing.&quot;
      (E.A., &quot;Towards a History of the 'Symbol'&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
      The giving of birthday gifts is a ritual deification of the recipient:
      his first appearance in the world is memorialized with sacrificial
      offerings. The birthday is the emblematic holiday of the atheistic
      age. In the Soviet period, the place of Christmas, the holiday
      of God-become-man, was taken by the birthday, the little one-day
      religion in which each person is honored as a god. <BR>
      Gift-givers are priests of the Personality; they specialize in
      bringing to each individual the sacrifice that most exactly corresponds
      to his individual qualities. And the poorer the material life
      of a given society, the greater the dignity and holiness of the
      gift. In Russia, the material level has always been lower than
      in the West, but the culture of the gift is proportionally higher.
      As E.A. writes, &quot;Gift-giving is an exact science. It has
      no place for approximations. The correct gift to one person cannot
      be given to another without turning into merchandise or a bribe
      rather than a gift. The correct recipient of a volume of Lermontov
      cannot be given a volume of Pushkin. The maker of a thing is
      a connoisseur of that thing, but its giver must be a connoisseur
      of the human soul as well, able to make fine discriminations
      among those delicate links that connect the world of the soul
      to the world of things. Gift-giving is the most democratic of
      religions, the applied science of practical ethics, esthetics,
      and psychology. . . . &quot; (E.A., &quot;On the Art of the Gift&quot;)</FONT></P>
