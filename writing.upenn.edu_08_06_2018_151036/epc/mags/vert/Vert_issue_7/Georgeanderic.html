    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">dear birds,</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">I enjoyed your fourth
    poem, &quot;dear birds.&quot; It includes many good images of
    &quot;birds&quot; that are indeed <I>dear</I>, if not deer-<I>like</I>.
    Wallace Stevens never knew the edge of four of three circles,
    curling inward like a strand of lost wheat. Cedar limbs sat in
    the only moving eye, and I especially enjoyed your use of metaphor
    blackening for the word <I>for</I>. My main suggestion is to
    show more that spell, to go further into the fade of the wing
    in your own vest, to find a nest that craves and does not crave
    chaos. Am I making sense? I looked out the window tonight and
    wondered whether a bird in the tree? Whether a worth in a bowl
    of cheerios continues the hand? Each oat grain composed of starlight
    not yet round, yet fingered together as fallen feather or heat.
    An exploding scar grips off dark sparks.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">I understand that Vallejo
    has injured her voice. I comprehend that her throat is busy birthing
    an egg. I know, now, why the lump in my throat is always present,
    even in calm. Why my moral still has qualms. Why the quagmire.
    Why my nonplussed. Why, even, the hamstrung. Why the bird on
    fire in her chest. Still, I wanted to know more about the clich&eacute;,
    to see if you could snow more than yell? To see if you might
    explore the beginning of the closing seed followed down the fierce
    flake? The ink pen is crawling. The key chain must be turning.
    Or something like and not <I>like</I> that, for simile is always
    smokier than known. Might the final flight in your feather be
    made more chloritic? Might the scientific prance? Is there a
    sway to slow the adam's apple sound to a single peck of red?
    Does this make helpful in the sense of your revisiting flight?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">sorry for my absence
    of lines, my breath has tightened over two hours becoming helical
    enough to infest the exact scent of your spine.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">i am curious about
    your veiled inclusion, or spurious lack thereof, of iodine in
    the forms you filled out. yes, the salt you sent in your recently
    collected saliva includes this &quot;necessary nutrient&quot;
    but the extraction process is as long as the morning is phosphor.
    was this unsifted sodium sent as an oblique reference to unindexed
    history, an aside describing passive resistance to the blood
    always pooling in the sea's sink. are you saying the gesture
    in a harvest of ash can be applied to the fall of colloidal grains.
    have you drawn a circle in the sand with an x.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">earlier, when i quoted
    my regional correspondent calling sunshine &quot;a syntactically
    inferior form of transportation,&quot; i was referring to the
    way your light splits my tongue in four directions, delaying
    the, causing an a in my of. yes, you can say i &quot;use whatever

    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">dear burrs,</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">I was wondering if
    I might. Then again, it could be just. You see, I have this ectoplasmic
    stitch and am sure of sound, similar, say, to the way a crow
    might count the dread. But I am thoroughly convinced by the ground
    of my saliva that the oil of Hudson doves instigates. The way
    a river might come upon the most lithic of lulls.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">You see, I was spelling
    your name backwards tonight, when the crown suddenly came to
    me, <I>cire</I>, and I wasn't sure whether to make the noise
    with my mouth or simply vowel away to sound. You apologize for
    the absence, for a halo of thorns, a nest of rose whips, but
    her braid has tightened in my pants, and now I know wind might
    not ever be solid. Soiled as glass caves we had once entered
    when we walked our wings westward into the herds that lie there,
    a thousand stars exiled as scars. I am glad of my papers. I am
    certain that their arrival means the endless. And my critique
    continues the way spit falls into a very deep lake. The public
    library is full of thieves who will not pay for how the earth
    reads their bodies back each day as indented in snow.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">And now my pedagogical.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">The circumference of

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">The pulp in my stomach
    even before the morning news.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">And so I apologize
    profusely for the burrs I sent in my teacherly. I confess--I
    couldn't sleep. Even after two cups of boiled milk gave my mustache
    a second skin. Tell me, can an auburn braid somehow curl above
    someone else's upper lip? Even across town? Even if his salt
    refuses the stratospheric lull of the sheets? I am at a. I am
    thoroughly convinced I couldn't, even if I. I'm not sure, even,
    whether my try at &quot;I&quot; is spilling off parts of itself
    as seed into the &quot;i&quot; you insist. Can you help? I would,
    of course, send you a burning owl, removing it from the chest
    of the woman you had inverted. Which might, anyway, be altruistic
    as wheat.</FONT></P>

    this piece clearly demonstrates, the centrifugal swerve in your

    Your notary has arrived with the grounded star, but she rubbed
    it in my forehead like a fleck of broken glass. Now whenever
    I close my eyes and peer inward, five limbs of a cedar appear,
    then become an elephant's four legs and trunk. I <I>do</I> keep
    the pointer, as you suggest, but given its phallic curve, I sleep
    with it under my pillow, a clove of garlic pressed there to coax
    a son from the sulferous tilt of moon. If the x ray returned
    blank it is only because when seen from the outside I am truly
    not a cedar limb. Nor am I a graphite scratch across her cheek.
    No one knows that better than you. Your own green depth. The
    swage of your plan. Your dark blue thumb full of rooster blood
    and rotating in the smear of your arm. Or was it a dislocated
    collarbone disguised as collard greens, rigid from the snap of
    sun that keeps their rot from hammering out of tune?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">Tonight, I went to
    the concert and heard Brahms' <I>Piano Concerto #2</I>. Yes,
    <I>saw</I> it spilling its salt backward through powder of the
    ground glass you gifted me with. Strange cut of sound I knew
    I could die inside, if I was truly alive. And then I wept, thinking
    of the owl so alone and on fire, so far from the school yard
    and that spilled lunch pail with the Hostess Twinkie converted
    to fasts. Maggots of the week long. Echoes of primordial dusk
    in the sip of. Even in the heaving forth of love mixed with aim.
    Iodine? Sure, but place it only in the left eye before closing
    the moths. See what it's like to see only orange through an orange
    eye. Dead opium green of wings left for velvet. Spread origami

    segments of his salt, spilling out as sparrow secretions onto
    the sheets. Crown of my heart, I am busy correcting everything
    I have ever bitten. Which includes the rotten green pepper on
    the counter, bruised with the slashing of lime yet clear as a

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">I fear the pointer
    will work too well, and I want to return it before I birth another
    smog separate from my moth. My collection is large. I keep it

    my solitude makes me decry. In fact, I find myself. And then
    I ask. And then wonder about the hen's <I>third</I>. Even its
    <I>thirty</I>-third. I find a room without many mirrors. And
    find myself offering the lamp one of my luck tongues. Which brings
    me to the question of lice. I offered to decipher for you, please
    recall, only <I>sea</I> lice, for they are part of the vowel
    to which I am impacted. Believe me, I am not partial to doves,
    even if I might say <I>grunt in your sleep</I>, backwards perhaps,
    until I lull it toward dissolve. I have kept a dead one. I have
    craved its arthritic. Creeled, even, its crease. I have crawled
    myself every name imaginable, tugging <I>taxidermy</I> from the
    dirt before all else.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">Perhaps I should clarify?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">That has been my precise

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">Who both came to me
    in last night's saliva, crimped as owl resin, on the pillow case.
    Alive as, yes, you might expect, except for the hen each kept
    hidden in blood upon an apron. <I>Grandfather</I>, I asked, <I>I
    never knew you too could wrap yourself so carefully in a napkin,
    could allow our mouths and leave out the cooking? </I>You can
    imagine my nakedness when, without shirts, he offered me olives
    and bread, saying something about his island and how I, too,
    might surround myself with watercress.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman">So what I mean is that
    <I>sea</I> lice at least crave salt even as they. Which strikes
    me as perfectly. Even acceptable as perhaps the best possible.

    into someone else's chest at your elopement of birth? To utter
    <I>crushed chalk</I> and <I>mean</I> it, even in the midst of
    inscribing your shame in the bone of her face? Still bone, central
    born, from which sound solidifies. From which a hen neck. From
    which an island inherits what's offered in the foam of a whitecap?
    <I>Snow skin</I>, you suggest, as an eruption of <I>thistle</I>?
    Well, yes. Epigene. Epidote. <I>Epigignesthai</I>. But honestly,
    burrs incurred--what core for one might mask? The room without
    many mirrors retracts my name back into the single spinal nerve.
    And the old sting might be cave loss as sung. A luck of tongue
    epinastic in the firestick. In the still damp lamp. Lightning
    stretch of sound that pries loose the old ways of chalking, scrawling
    alert the thousand mouths, sting-beats I've amassed over years
    in the loose paces of my homology.</FONT></P>
