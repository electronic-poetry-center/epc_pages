introductions. she is hot, in this light. however I'm nothing special. I know, I know
the trees behind it when I was stuck in traffic, turned around and she was still,
looking for a taxi with sunglasses on. no shoeshines for the weak and
no bartender. no inscription or fine lines for you for example you've been smudged. here we
are with no posse she's got her jacket over her shoulders or call it a wrap, I could never do that, </FONT>
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I want her more than I want to be her. I could wiggle but I don't dance,
sweet or I did already. get some limes, I'm ready to start, she's hot,
a shot, or on ice. your drink interrupted, clacking about and
the drink is more delicious than the poem which you can see through, put to sleep.
