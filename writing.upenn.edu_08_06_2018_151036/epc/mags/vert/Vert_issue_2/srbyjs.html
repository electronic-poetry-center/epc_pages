  &quot;Sitings&quot; refers to objects or events seen: a witness
  to action or the passing of action. The actual and the real to
  the extent that these can be defined by &quot;she who has seen.&quot;</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Like her 1999 book, <I>not-chicago</I>
  (Melodeon), Rosenthal's <I>Sitings</I> is populated by stray
  voices, odd figures, alien subjects whose presence fascinates
  us not because of the way they live (we don't know how they live)
  but because of the things they say. It's also possible that no
  one speaks, that language doesn't speak, that the speech act
  itself is speaking instead. <BR>
  <I>The </I>speech <I>act </I>itself <I>is </I>speaking -- when
  speech happens in writing, it's an experience of distance that
  moves through (and continues to distance) the ghost of the written
  word. Deconstruction was a critical confirmation of a creative
  fact -- that language is unstable, that a text is was always
  different, manipulable -- because language has forever been unsure,
  unconvincing, unconvinced, in the mouths of speakers we can neither
  hear nor see. And yet our belief hinges upon what they say because
  we cannot see or hear them, we trust that the words they speak
  are representative of who they say they are. We trust language
  for what it says about character and use language to mistrust
  character. But now I'm speaking about novels.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I'm arguing that it's more useful
  to think about how a character is constructed in a novel than
  about the voice which carries the poem in speaking about Rosenthal's
  writing.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The five sections of <I>Sitings</I>
  are each a kind of blankness -- that of a character presented
  solely through the language that comprises thought as speech.
  &quot;Religiosity&quot; is a series of letters to the alphabet
  from an &quot;I&quot; observing the &quot;shifting shafts of
  shining&quot; language taken from the picturesque world of the
  real. Here's an arbitrary cross-section of sentences:</FONT></P>

    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">We agree on ten minutes. In that
    space my eggs grow wings. The relation of each to a replaceable
    third forms the core of this dilemma.</FONT></I></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear E,</FONT></I></P>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Everyone at this party designs
    something. Think of it as a story I didn't get around to writing.</FONT></I></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">These are some of the poem's lines
  in a cross-cut fashion -- the poem resists the operation, even
  toughens up under the scalpel, because it's built on the tension
  of associative speech, where words are doors opened to rooms
  whose windows fill the room with the light of thought.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The active nature of thought moves
  quickly from room to room, and the &quot;I&quot; of thought engages
  the other, the &quot;you&quot; on the other side of speech.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">If prose is the form in which
    a writer attempts a novel, can a novel exist as a result of the
    force that turns history into a pure voice that speaks but does
    not tell? <BR>
    (Schneider, ..But I Could Not Speak...)</FONT></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The &quot;you&quot; is the aim of
  our speech, the thing to which we speak, the object of the character's
  subject made clear in the light of desire, the end that communication
  seeks.</FONT></P>

    <P><I><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Thus it is only by our passion
    for speech that we evade change and risk one another so as to
    wipe again the surface clean.<BR>

  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The novel tells the adventure of
  interiority; the content of the novel is the story of the soul

  a romantic subject, a wistfully blown kiss in the direction of
