    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Jono Schneider's book of poems &quot;In
    the Room,&quot; published July 2000 by a+bend press, takes as
    its project the items of a room, which include some of the following
    things (in no particular order): Screen, Sock, Hand, Sand, Pant,
    Cap, Ring, Rim, Key, Page, Pane... There are thirty three poems,
    thirty three things, each poem containing eight lines, as if
    stamped out repeatedly, as if stamp like. (One of the thirty-three
    poems is indeed titled &quot;Stamp.&quot;) But what of the &quot;worlds&quot;
    surrounding such &quot;things,&quot; and of the language used
    to interrogate the whole of the room? So much of &quot;In the
    Room&quot; revolves around the relationship between what is said
    and what is meant, what is done and what is created, and what
    creates what. Case in point-- &quot;The Screen,&quot; p. 9</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The Screen</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Shut out the parts<BR>
    which act. And did art?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">In the stiff position of<BR>
    significance, &quot;The self</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">hater.&quot; Speech can dust,<BR>
    sifts what's required of dust</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">covers the world with<BR>
    an opinion's shift.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The transitions that occur throughout
    the poem, as if they are the very act itself thrust into/against
    the &quot;screen,&quot; creates a density, a precision, an atomic
    bouncing between unstable locations of meaning. Locations that
    consist of statements, &quot;Shut out the parts/ which act.&quot;
    questions, &quot;And did art?&quot; then almost jokes, &quot;In
    the stiff position of / significance,&quot; as if drawing in
    the sexual while also, perhaps, commenting on the over determined
    readiness of the <I>significant. </I>&quot;The self hater.&quot;
    issues forth like a quasi-philosophic comment containing both
    pathetic humor and poignant recognition. These sentiments could
    be drawn together to form a commentary on masculinity that is
    as precise as it is possible to be missed, (indeed I may have
    missed it?). (There are many such moments of recognition in this
    book of poems.) &quot;The Screen&quot; comes to rest on concepts
    rendered from the word screen. As if Screen were an apparatus
    of thinking and seeing, as in a mental skrim or veil, through
    which we look and see the world, &quot;sifts what's required
    of dust/ cover the world with / an opinion's shift.&quot; As
    if the Screen of the poem were the room, and in this way we are
    privy to a kind of dislocation-- there is nor physical screen,
    no physical room, but out in the book of room, room as self,
    as world, as language, as project, a place we live in. Other
    associations-- &quot;The Screen&quot; sounds peculiarly like
    Edvard Munch's &quot;The Scream.&quot; This poem, then, could
    be read as a curious post-modern comment on the nature of alienation,
    which is no longer a face reverberating in horror, but something
    far more familiar. The precision and almost collage like leaps
    of &quot;The Screen&quot; is indicative of the other poems throughout
    the book; much of which bristles against its eight line form,
    attempting, in its own way of broken telegramming, to get its
    all out. <BR>

    Notice where plurality investigated by first rendering Pants
    singular, as if trying to order language and &quot;perception/s&quot;
    into someplace where one could begin; as if such a beginning
    held capability of containing a whole new whole. A preciseness
    that perceives &quot;from a buried origin.&quot; The quotation
    marks are interesting in the way they suggest either the spoken
    voice of the narrator, or a voice heard-- as if fashioned by
    an other. The opportunity also exists that the quote is just
    that, an except of other written material? In any case, it is
    an interruption, a collage like intrusion, that multiplies the
    voices of the poem, that places a duality into the singularity
    of &quot;The Pant.&quot; This insistence on complicating the
    notion of the singular, and thereby the plural, the fact that
    one is not presented without the other, that the two exist interconnected,
    patently unstable, each reverting to the other as a matter of
    course, revels the manner of thought which echoes throughout
    Jono Schneider's book.</FONT></P>

    In the poems &quot;The Ring&quot; p. 3 and the &quot;The Cap&quot;
    p. 4 the order of sense, and the making of order are a part of
    how I read Jono's work :</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The Ring</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">&quot;...made the hand and man&quot;

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">made him, window on		    <BR>

    <PRE></PRE>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">In &quot;The Ring&quot; &quot;...the
    hand and man&quot; are made-- as if the ring lends a level of
    gravity which, in turn, makes them. The next line &quot;made
    him, window on / <I>aged</I> water, waiter&quot;. The presence
    of &quot;aged water&quot; appears as a flash of deep lyric, while
    the use of the &quot;waiter&quot;works like a tag, lifting the
    context of the line-- thereby balancing out the almost mythic
    implications of &quot;<I>aged</I> water&quot;; while &quot;water&quot;
    and &quot;waiter&quot; suggest each other, are alliterative,
    functioning as a signal of the happy accidents involved in poetic
    construction.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The Cap</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The cap stuck to feather;<BR>
    sized boatside as in <I>winter</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">lettered, &quot;I've not seen<BR>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">parked cars, clothing <BR>

    <I>the head had made items.<BR>
    </I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    This sense of what is being made, and what makes what, is further
    examined in &quot;The Cap.&quot; The last line of &quot;The Cap&quot;
    states that, <I>&quot;the head had made items.&quot; </I>This
    cap, is perhaps a thinking cap that is both the head and the
    cap, as if they are in some fashion refashioned, married, &quot;sights
    entwined.&quot; This sense of each &quot;thing&quot; somehow
    evoking the other is evident in the first line of the poem as
    well when the &quot;cap&quot; is &quot;stuck to feather&quot;
    as opposed to the usual expression, &quot;Stick a feather in
    your cap.&quot; This reversal is evocative of Nietzsche's &quot;On
    Truth and Lies in an Nonmoral Sense&quot; which posits that a
    rock is not hard, what is meant is we are soft. This inability
    to pronounce any sort objective state for the rock is the new
    sense of &quot;truth&quot; extended in the third line, &quot;I've
    not seen this,&quot; and we, the readers, ask just what has been
    seen? And therein start our own journey through our own room.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    A line from &quot;The Box&quot; p.32, &quot;Brume flecked/ over,
    or, spilled, seals.&quot; The desire I register to somehow say
    &quot;spealled&quot; when I see &quot;spilled, seals.&quot; exemplifies
    the joy &quot;In the Room&quot; evokes, compacting thought and
    response into short and sometimes deceptive poems, whose wittily
    collaged four two line dramas move through the body to produce
    a sort of discombobulated honesty, a &quot;...scream's semantic
    act.&quot; &quot;The Blinds&quot; p. 12</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>
    And yet, the work seems shy, as if revealing its story only upon
    interrogation, seemingly bent on tip-toeing through the living
    room and out the door, trying to escape the very room the poems
    propose to examine. The poems' musicality enables the nearly
    immediate disappearance of sense, and we are left with an after
    effect in which we search for the moment just past. The Mallarme
    quote at the beginning of the book captures this: &quot;Not to
    paint the thing itself, but the effect it produces.&quot; &quot;In
    The Room&quot; also proposes its opposite: means, &quot;Not to
    paint the effect itself, but the thing it produces.&quot;</FONT></P>
