    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 1,<BR>
    The stenciled hand shown opposite, stretched too far, asked to
    believe.<BR>
    				<BR>
    Dear 2,<BR>
    Circuit diagrams, road signs. Remembering how accusations had
    led to restraint. <BR>
    Appealed to the evidence.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 3,<BR>
    A knot in a handkerchief can remind its illiterate owner. <BR>
    One step, then another. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 4,<BR>
    Following the traces of characters invented and abandoned. <BR>
    Histories begin to illuminate the subtle.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 5,<BR>
    Pronunciation of  2 as in 2+3. Engraved and printed on rocks.
<BR>
    Spell it.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 6,<BR>
    A secret was entrusted, guarded to the last moment, though still
    afoot. <BR>
    Beckon, and without a word. Each is named with a codex portrait.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 7,<BR>
    Wait for a system of signals, regretting the loss. <BR>
    Printed here horizontally in order to differentiate bee from
    wasp. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 8,<BR>
    Perhaps even an alphabet.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 9,<BR>
    Address the article: pleats cut off at the knee now carefully
    restored to its original height and form.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 10,<BR>
    Place in glass, rather than build a stone mound. Breath. Again.
<BR>
    Reiterating the final consonant. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 11,<BR>
    You will want to look for volume on top.  <BR>
    These particulars used to count the most discrete objects. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 12,<BR>
    Area is one of understated elegance. A week later, inseparable.
<BR>
    Search for a name, designed to be much easier as everyone knew.
     </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 13,<BR>
    Walk in an assumed little dress. Tied things, broad, wide, sit
    on your hips. <BR>
    Different shapes could be used. </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 14,<BR>
    Unable or unwilling, so near, but also elsewhere and otherwise.
<BR>
    Gradually, as the sound of footsteps.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear 15,<BR>
    There are certainly profound differences. <BR>
    If we repeat this calculation four more times, we move from front
    to back.  </FONT></P>
