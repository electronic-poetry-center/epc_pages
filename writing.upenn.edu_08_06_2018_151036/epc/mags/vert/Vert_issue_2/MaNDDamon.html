    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">She plays thread by thread, the
    color blue ancient &amp; respected.<BR>
    Grafted symbol to symbol, internal tattoos that hold have held.<BR>
    Working girl waiting by the side of the rode to pick him up.<BR>
    Open the Book of Organscream to the title page, by now.<BR>
    Around my heart, on its red membrane sheath, there is a serpent-tattoo,<BR>
    elaborate protectress of the Bloodrights of the Lady. Working
    girl<BR>
    pulls over and unlocks cardoor. Car is an utter mess inside;
    driftwood,<BR>
    white quartz and rose-colored spiral shells litter its cavern
    space.<BR>
    Open the book of Illuminations to lessons on the History of the
    Aura.<BR>
    He fancies SUREFIRE getting in, but there are snakes. They are
    not<BR>
    moving KNOT slowly. Time is quick &amp; energy is INSTANTANEOUSLY<BR>
    momentous. He offers kisses to the KNOTTED snakes &amp; rose
    quartz<BR>
    heirlooms to working girl. THE WORKING GIRL WORKS ON THE AIR-LOOMS.
    The<BR>
    car is a SPACIOUS wilderness, special obstacles the heart negotiates.<BR>
    There are at least two TUMULT sides to every passion. The Book
    of Trust<BR>
    has the pages about Liminal Leaps torn out, missing, penciled
    in with<BR>
    cryptic longings. The book of Knots has illuminated pages, as
    if some<BR>
    fire had gotten in between the front and back side of each sheaf
    of<BR>
    text, making it an object with glowing interiority.<BR>
