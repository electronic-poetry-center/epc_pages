    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Within one hour the phone will ring<BR>
    Begin tomorrow. If we're giving explanations<BR>
    Then we're hats off <BR>
    to the Emperors of Professionalism<BR>
    in a colony of rodents gnawing a rope <BR>
    hanging from the inside of a gold nipple cupola<BR>
    hanging from there until the Director<BR>
    instructs the Poet to give up the habit <BR>
    and cut the vermin down <BR>
    So we can all get on with our science<BR>
    After all, that's what science is meant for<BR>

    Lyrics under-rated<BR>
    Ponderous Gloucester yammering<BR>
    Poundian absurdiana amounted <BR>
    mountains of speed pills, alcohol<BR>
    When his liver gave out <BR>
    Whalen said he found himself crying <BR>
    big tears, unaccountably <BR>
    Crying there, then finished his pork noodles</FONT></P>

    of asterisks in his work<BR>
    with the concurrence of elephants bathing<BR>
    and fortune cookies that promise things<BR>
    we've always wanted, would be received. Patience <BR>
    will get us all we want. Ten numbers to bet on<BR>
    Lotto. There's no money only divine appreciation <BR>
    of mind moving over plate--<BR>
    black bean sauce, shrimp and long beans<BR>
    Tea makes the belly warm, should be kept from women<BR>
    Beer makes a belly bigger</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">She read a poem over the phone<BR>
    It skipped around, about diphthongs, abstract <BR>
    Smattered with paraphernalia, medicines<BR>
    She massaged her nipples<BR>
    Nodded on Huckleberry Finn and went to sleep</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">And the phone never rang as the
    hour <BR>
    rang out it's drizzling remains. All my fears <BR>
    unfounded by-product of Jewish <BR>
    upbringing. I'll be loved like a brother<BR>
    Adored past complaint by a flame crowned dragon <BR>
    and my own child will remember me as a good guy</FONT></P>

    Navy surplus poncho. Cane <BR>
    down worn granite <BR>
    steps off curb into channel rushing <BR>
    Strong enough to climb laces, flood stiff foot<BR>
    That slow walk up to the second floor took 75 years</FONT></P>

    Some live and keep record in notebooks<BR>
    Either way the notebooks are put in storage<BR>
    We lose the pages, unable to correct punctuation or say <BR>
    what it was we meant the first time or when we said it</FONT></P>
