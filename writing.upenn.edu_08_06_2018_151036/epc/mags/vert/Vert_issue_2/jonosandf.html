  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">III</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Each reason a deafening, each increase
  a closing. The rooted anguish is time's prolifigation watching
  rivers flow to rippled edges. One forms a hidden solitude, the
  commodity is form.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">And so I bought the book, not knowing
  why, and sat there good, a melon full of seedlings, but don't
  know how to light the grill in December. I live between May and
  November; Indians ride by in their hats, pants and beads.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The book sits in the sand, yellow
  light in the folds and why indeed? Why indeed?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The book caught the lighting fields
  in its net of palominos that storm the sun, a legend I infuse
  with grief. And I sing slowly, the dying of an aged god, the
  palominos, the dried twigs -- my dear, where is that book surging
  this evening?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">I aim slowly today till November
  and to tell you why not and why not as the pages blow against
  the window, wishing, in all their indefinite pleasure, for some
  quintessential measure.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">The sentence eats its way across
  the page, beginning as darkness and escapes as light in stammers,
  &quot;lets begin at the end&quot; without tradition. A sentence
  is left inert as flame. We arrive where light turns itself again.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">There is hardly more than the going
  -- a trust assigned to itself.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">From the blue silos of sky to the
  egregious sunset, a fabric moon and laced stars -- an urge to
  speak. &quot;There must be an unutterable phrase&quot; -- this
  is the matter from which all sentences must have begun.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Began, begot, became as was sought,
  from which it had naught, in the matter of difficult beginnings,
  the sentence aimed and occured. The sentence fights its way across
  plague, a black train in snow which sings. This is not meter.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">IV</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Are things to be -- to be believed?<BR>
  Are selves things to be believed, caused by words are things
  themselves if believed?<BR>
  Languages qualify products that qualify.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Names are things as decimals denounce
  unambiguity -- the &quot;of&quot; of of.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Philosophy made leash by unmanageable
  fact. Numbers save those who behold the equation.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Are words where questions question
  tautologies or the precision of things in space?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">This dumb rock.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Are words susceptible intervals
  between word and ground?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Song meant as carved essence, music
  where the assured word not wedded to language as in poem not
  word is leased as names lash equation.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS">Where things are word integer is
  added to rock.</FONT></P>
