      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">No half measures in this war,
      says one of the<BR>
      nine survivors of the first-up win.<BR>
      It was like removing a Band-Aid really slowly<BR>
      on a golf-course, while the Global Early Warning<BR>
      and Tracking System begins a licensing shake-up.<BR>
      The Campaign for Real Ale said: &quot;Be skeptical<BR>
      of guaranteed air pollution reductions, a<BR>
      shell game with government ethics.&quot;<BR>
      But the watchdog lacks a smear campaign that might<BR>
      ignore letters if they are identical.  Until then,<BR>
      my pledge to the refugees: the air<BR>
      campaign goes on.  We suspected as much<BR>
      and launched our low budget mish mash<BR>
      of landmines, pressing for opening hours<BR>
      to be more relaxed.  Joe Lieberman<BR>
      spent much of this day in Tennessee, while<BR>
      Bill and Newt call for treatment in prisons<BR>
      and a generic promotion for whisky. </FONT></P>
