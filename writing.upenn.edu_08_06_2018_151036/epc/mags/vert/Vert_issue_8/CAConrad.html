      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Mr. President this morning
      i called my cousin in Wyoming<BR>
      his boyfriend was making the coffee like many good people do<BR>
      in this beautiful country my cousin told me to tell you it's
      madness<BR>
      you bring us when i told him i was writing to you today it's
      been<BR>
      awhile since i've seen you in person on the streets of Philadelphia<BR>
      you were waving and then you were speaking hey we've all heard<BR>
      the stories of your cocaine and booze and i want to say i'm sorry<BR>
      about your parents i'm sure other children of CIA brass need
      a<BR>
      little craziness to get a little loose do a line of coke get
      naked and<BR>
      run around campus were you freer back then of course you were<BR>
      i'm an idiot for asking and i remember cologne when you spoke
      in<BR>
      Philadelphia and i know it was your cologne you had that<BR>
      i'm-wearing-cologne air about you see i believe there's a<BR>
      big man inside you and yes we're angry right now yes it's<BR>
      about war yes it's about many things the things men with<BR>
      little time for love will impose on others and i wish i could<BR>
      say HEY we're all going to be dead in a hundred years so let's<BR>
      shift the pace let's forget about war let's pass a Let's Get<BR>
      Naked And Crazy National Holiday i wish it was this easy but<BR>
      nothing is ever easy with a man who has little time for love<BR>
      and a man with little time for love is really just a man who<BR>
      hasn't had love yet you haven't really had love yet there's no<BR>
      way you could have had love real love and not want every human<BR>
      body to have medical care if they need it have education if they<BR>
      want it have more time with their families and loves like we
      all<BR>
      NEED it Mr. President i'm worried your self esteem was damaged<BR>
      many years ago and keeps you from seeing us out here our bodies<BR>
      our black and white and red and yellow and Iraqi and Korean bodies<BR>
      and we're all a little fucked-up with our problems but i know
      i JUST<BR>
      know there's a big man inside of you big enough to really SEE
      need<BR>
      and offer without hesitation because you can because there is
      plenty<BR>
      you are stronger than your father's blueprints for your life
      i've seen<BR>
      your fingers in person you have nice hands Mr. President and
      they're<BR>
      your hands not your father's hands your life is your own it really
      is<BR>
      it belongs to you and love is waiting i have a lot of love Mr.
      President<BR>
      and i just want to press against you sometimes to let you get
      a little<BR>
      of it HEY i'm so serious about this let's go away together this
      spring<BR>
      just the two of us it's not a big deal don't even tell anybody
      i mean<BR>
      you're the president after all but there's a marvelous stretch
      of woods<BR>
      where i grew up we could smoke a little pot to wind you down
      get you<BR>
      out of your oval office mode maybe a little wine i'm sure you
      need a<BR>
      good massage maybe we could go to the creek and paint secret<BR>
      mud symbols on our naked bodies like i used to do with my first<BR>
      boyfriend what happens after that will be fine you'll see it
      will<BR>
      be okay the break in the woods has the best flowers to rest<BR>
      beside in the sun and you will awaken with a crown of honeysuckle<BR>
      beautiful man that you are a real leader of real<BR>
      lives who can change the world</FONT></P>
