        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Michael:</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A bright, sunny, February day,
        not too long after you've left, not three weeks since I said
        goodbye to you and Lindsay after the play &quot;wrapped,&quot;
        but it feels like months to me, and it must seem even longer
        to you. President's Day. Diane and I were supposed to go up to
        Orr Hot Springs for a much-needed mini-vacation, but a bad case
        of bronchitis for Di prevented us from leaving yesterday, as
        we'd planned, and storm damage to 101 N kept us from making it
        at all (having discovered almost subliminally, the way you do
        when you're &quot;on the road,&quot; not an hour into our drive
        that all roads to Ukiah were impossible).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And so came home, almost happily,
        considering that Di is still more or less too weak for such a
        journey but wanted to try to go, anyway. Instead, we hit a matinee
        of <I>The Quiet American</I> at the Bridge, and now Diane is
        sleeping in the bedroom as it creeps on towards evening. Not
        sure why I'm telling you all this, but the film did make me think
        again of something that first occurred to me at yesterday's protest
        march, although I have had the thought, dimmer and vaguer, before
        at protests -- and knowing how ambivalent you always were about
        them, that we ought to be doing something more, or different
        -- namely, that sense of being a tiny cog in a great wheel, of
        wanting to float above it all and see what it looks like -- not
        just the march, but the whole bloody thing, the world, the war,
        the resistance movement...</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Maybe it's just the nature of
        the way things are happening that makes time seem to pass so
        swiftly, to telescope in this weird way. A shuttle explodes in
        the sky, strewing debris all over the southwestern belt of the
        country... another &quot;deadline&quot; comes and goes, and the
        build-up continues... and then there are the more personal struggles,.
        the triumphs, the set-backs, the just plain exigencies of going
        on with work, with life, with love...</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I want to know that what I'm
        doing is right, but sometimes it's not so simple. All of us want
        to simplify this whole war thing down to the same black/white
        terms that Bush proposes, only with us in the good guy role,
        of course -- to believe that it's all about money and oil --
        which may very well ultimately be true, but don't ever discount
        the basic sincerity of Bush's moral stance. That's how he's able
        to strike at the roots of so many people's feelings and fears.
        Just as the &quot;enemy&quot; he projects in the Mid-East is
        his shadow, he is <I>our</I> shadow... operating along lines
        of subconscious fears and urges even those who are handling him
        don't suspect...</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Or do they?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dozing off just a little while
        ago, I had a dream-vision in which I was helping defend a watch-tower
        in a desert, and when I and all the other soldiers popped up
        to begin shooting, we were shooting at a vast mirror that perfectly
        surrounded us, and which shattered as we shot so that we didn't
        notice we shot at a mirror; the moment our bullets struck the
        surface, the mirror broke apart into &quot;reality.&quot; The
        only reason I saw it was because I stood a little ways back from
        the action in the dream -- I had just enough of an &quot;overview,&quot;
        what I lacked when I marched.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Of course</FONT></I><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">, you might say -- and yet the profundity
        of the mirror was its very insidiousness. The devil convincing
        you it doesn't exist = the mirror convincing you it is elsewhere.
        The camouflaged mirror. The everywhere-mirror, as if there is
        nothing that isn't &quot;I&quot;. Nothing that isn't a reflection
        of something else, and that something else is behind you, and
        different than what it seems. And so the reflection of me marching
        is me charging up a hill, firing an AK, pushing a button to drop
        a bomb -- and doing it not because it's the &quot;evil,&quot;
        twisted me, the bizarro me, but because it's right, and I believe
        it's right. In other words, the shadow-sense that <I>I'm</I>
        the one who's deluded, to be marching, we all are, pawns in a
        game that's bigger and more complex than we could ever know...</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, Michael, these are the
        strange kinds of thoughts that I've been having lately. Ultimately
        I must be anti-war, and do everything in my power to stop it,
        because I feel that it's wrong -- even if it turns out that I'm
        wrong, that not going to war -- or even altering it by helping
        to stand against it, by taking part in that collective &quot;NO&quot;
        -- turns out to be far worse than actually doing it. I must be,
        because the others who are against it seem so much more clear
        and enlightened than those who aren't -- damn the secret consequences
        and the strange reflections, the parallels.</FONT></P>
