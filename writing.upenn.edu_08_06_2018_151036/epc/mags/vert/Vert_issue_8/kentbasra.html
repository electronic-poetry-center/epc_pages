      Basra Exceeds Its Object</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Come off it, Tha'lab, you faker,
      you <I>kadhib,</I> <BR>
      yes, very funny, but for goodness sake, just<BR>
      put back those purple bowels in your tummy,<BR>
      you'll be late for work!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Make haste, Safia, you little
      scamp, you pig-tailed <I>qasida,<BR>
      </I>put that fat flap of scalp back on your crown,<BR>
      now's not the hour for teenage pranks,<BR>
      it's time to go to school!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Ah, quit moaning Miss Al-Sayab,
      you <I>muwashshara,<BR>
      </I>we know that fetus hanging from your bottom is a rubber trick-<BR>
      we're not stupid, you know, so cease being crass,<BR>
      and get ye to market!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Cut the crap, Nizar, you <I>iltizam,<BR>
      </I>pick that torso up and put it back on your dancing spine-<BR>
      we know that old box and mirror trick,<BR>
      now get thee to prayers!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Hey, Rashid, you <I>al-nahda,<BR>
      </I>we know you love the special effects of Hollywood movies,<BR>
      but it's not safe to make yourself into a geyser of fire-<BR>
      and anyway, you're supposed to be accompanying the inspectors!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Say there, little Samih, you
      <I>shirnur,<BR>
      </I>six-month-olds aren't supposed to be able to fly-<BR>
      so get down from those power lines and gather<BR>
      your legs and head on the ground here, you naughty child!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Listen, Tawfiq, you <I>tafila,<BR>
      </I>OK, so you're a sorry-assed academic with a Ba'ath mustache,<BR>
      but put your brains back into your head, you can't fool us by
      calling in sick-<BR>
      it's time for class and your students are ablaze!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Yo bro, my main-man Bashad,
      you <I>tardiyyat, <BR>
      </I>you're as if dead and white as marble, but there's not a
      scratch on your body-<BR>
      quit fucking around, the mosque is rubble, <BR>
      make the siren light flash and spin on your ambulance!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Greetings Ahmad, you <I>badi-kamriyyat,<BR>
      </I>put your face back on and also that water pipe hose thing
      back into your belly-<BR>
      you've been a joker since you were five,<BR>
      but now you're a father, so pick up that basket of combs and
      gum!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Good morning, Mrs. al-Jurjani,
      you <I>madin,<BR>
      </I>author of four essays on postmodern currents in American
      poetry,<BR>
      what are you howling and wailing like that for, hitting your
      skull<BR>
      against the flagstones like a mechanical hammer? <BR>
      A horse is a horse, and if a horse is dead, a horse is dead-<BR>
      More so, you are naked, which is unbecoming of a lady your age
      and standing. <BR>
      Like Hamlet, your emotion is unconvincing, for it exceeds its
      object.<BR>
      Therefore, we beseech you: Put a plug in it.</FONT></P>
