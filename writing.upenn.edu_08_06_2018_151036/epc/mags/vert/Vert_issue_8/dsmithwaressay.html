      </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">ESSAY ON WAR</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Looking out a window. There
      are stars. A hunter and a scorpion. Polaris and Antares. The
      cold winter wind. I was minding my own business. Looking for
      ways to address this war. There are lists of atrocities catalogued
      by acquisitive minds.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I woke up this morning to a
      woodpecker working the dead walnut by our window. We live along
      the 98th meridian. We have organic produce and alternative news
      sources. Images collect in the air.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I stuck my foot into the ground.
      The shovel slid easily into black clay. There was mist in the
      air, and my little boy played nearby. With loppers I cut dead
      elm roots. Ten inches down, 24 around. My wife clipped the dead
      branches of the salvia indigo. The plumbego had frozen back too.
      We were three in the yard. Our car leaked oil on driveway mulch.
      There's a spirit in these limbs. The clay stuck to my boots and
      hands. We spread mulch and grew hungry. For lunch there were
      eggs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There are few subtle gestures
      this new year. A pine grosbeak surprised me, fluttering up to
      the sunflower seeds. We learned humming birds are native to North
      America. I sipped mate de coca, illegally, pleasantly, but barely
      high.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I shared a bench in Sana'a with
      an Iraqi once. That was ten years ago now. He taught high school.
      Mailed riyals to Baghdad each month.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Why does your president
      do this?&quot; he asked. They were bombing again. The traffic
      was loud and the air polluted. School children laughed at Egyptian
      cartoons on television. A man squeezed fresh lemon juice into
      a blender with ice. Boys on motorcycles flashed by in brilliant
      colors. Men shared plates in a nearby caf&eacute;. Some carried
      daggers on their hips.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Picking up shoes. Sweeping the
      floor. Putting the trash out. My son took his chicken with pesto.
      The wind changed. It was warmer. The evening sky broke up into
      streaks of light. The tree was planted. I hoped it might rain.
      Set the jade on the porch. No moon, but fog. Mist again. Another
      night.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">ESSAY ON WAR II</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's New Year's Eve. The Chinese
      New Year-Year of the Sheep. And today was warm and sunny. My
      little boy went bare-foot. The bullvine bloomed and redbuds lifted
      a few tiny pink nodes from gray limbs. Quince branches flamed
      with red blossoms and sparrows and cardinals searched seed among
      the wort and grasses. The wind was dry, and from the west.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My son and I went to the mall
      for blue jeans. Red balloons lifted above the clothing racks.
      I wanted Levi's but they didn't have any my size. The boy squirmed.
      Said, &quot;Water,&quot; which sounded like &quot;Wado,&quot;
      some distant outpost of the imagination.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This evening I met a graduate
      student. He studied journalism and was about my age. I mentioned
      a professor in his department, a leftist ideologue. Yes, the
      student studied with him. He evinced a polite dislike for the
      teacher, actually. &quot;I could never be a professional journalist,&quot;
      he said. &quot;School was a convenient place to land. Some things
      fell through.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Other things now worked in his
      favor. He had been a Green Beret. Perhaps, once in that elite
      corps, it's hard to leave. Having joined another special operations
      reserve unit, he awaited departure orders to Iraq.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;It's already started,&quot;
      he said, referring to the future war with Baghdad.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We drank beer in the pleasant
      evening air, Hoa holding our son who was stirring french fries
      into a glass of water. Grackles crapped on the deck and on unoccupied,
      wrought iron tables.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We talked systems. Technology.
      &quot;Human nature.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The realism of the right is
      as distorted as the idealism of the left. And it's hard to sign
      up for the desert when what you're fighting for is Nike, Coca-Cola
      and McDonald's. Obese America. Grim conditions of the homeland,
      as it is-fear and terror fuelling democracy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But he had practical interests
      in soldiering, and understood what he did in accordance with
      national security. Machiavelli, not Marx. It was an appropriate
      post-renaissance position.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Communism could never
      work,&quot; he said. &quot;Those ideals never withstand the manipulations
      others press on them.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;But what comes after the
      gold rush?&quot; I asked him. &quot;After the American pig-out?&quot;
      We laughed, yes, the pig-out. We oinked a little even, but he
      didn't answer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I admired his conviction, and
      it must be fun. Armed with the knowledge of terminal technologies.
      Slipping into the darkness of a northern desert. Squatting in
      a mufrag over a glowing laptop. Boys and their toys. He took
      me seriously. He was sincere. I liked him.<BR>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">ESSAY ON WAR III-YEAR OF
      THE GOAT</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The Space Shuttle cracked up
      40 miles over Texas. Little chunks spread across the state. Israel's
      first astronaut scattered into the Lone Star sky.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My son and I worked in the yard,
      tearing out weeds and pruning dead growth. He dragged the loppers
      behind him. Said, &quot;Loppers,&quot; dropped them, and squatted
      beside a bed of bullvine.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And now winter brings cold wind
      from the north. My son refused to wear a coat, and his nose turned
      red. We read books and he went to bed. David Hadbawnik called
      and we talked about war.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&sect;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A red tailed hawk landed in
      the sycamore next door. She rests on a high branch. Blue jays
      dive at her head. She is impressive and gorgeous.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">How will these days add up?
      The little boy runs into my room completely naked. &quot;Hawk,
      hawk, hawk,&quot; he says. And, &quot;penis,&quot; touching himself.
      He tries to sound like a hawk too, projecting a high-pitched
      screech.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This is the year of the goat.
      We have red wine. Bananas in coconut shavings. Sprigs of rosemary
      and lemon grass. Our days are domestic and careful. There are
      no jobs, and only small things to believe in.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&sect;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Look at the baby playing with
      his mother. He follows her. Picks up the hose and holds it to
      his mouth. She is cutting flowers, pruning the pink, faded blooms.
      And I wish that he would come here. Stand on my knees in his
      orca Robeez. But he is otherwise occupied. He sees bees in the
      daisies.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">On the news I heard of protests
      in Germany. Ten thousand in the streets of Munich.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Put dead leaves in the compost
      bin. Dried out winter stems and branches. Datura seeds break
      out of crisp brown pod. Raccoon tracks are lightly etched in
      black clay.</FONT></P>
