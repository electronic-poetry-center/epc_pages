      The Lottery <BR>
      </FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Florida-where I grew up-began
      having a lottery<BR>
      when I was 9 or 10. The lottery excited me;<BR>
      I wanted my parents to win. Dad would <BR>
      buy a tickets or two sometimes. I thought <BR>
      he should buy more tickets more often. The news <BR>
      regularly showed people who bought ten, <BR>
      twenty, even a hundred tickets. Their odds seemed <BR>
      better than ours. Dad felt the odds didn't <BR>
      justify spending-or wasting-more than the <BR>
      occasional dollar. &quot;Lotteries are a tax on stupidity&quot;
<BR>
      he said, &quot;and I think that's about how stupid I<BR>
      am.&quot; He explained the odds of winning <BR>
      this way: &quot;Imagine 200 Tampa Stadiums <BR>
      in a row, each filled with people.&quot; Tampa <BR>
      Stadium sat about 75,000 people. &quot;Every person in every
<BR>
      stadium has a lottery ticket. You are in a stadium <BR>
      with a ticket too. You have a one in two hundred <BR>
      chance of being in the same stadium as the winner.&quot; <BR>
      I was astonished; the lottery was hopeless.<BR>
      But ever since I have used the Tampa Stadium<BR>
      model to conceptualize large numbers of people. <BR>
      Like the CDC estimates there are 40,000 new <BR>
      HIV infections in the US each year <BR>
      equals slightly more than half a stadium. <BR>
      I read recently that in the event of an invasion of Iraq, <BR>
      relief agencies estimate that 500,000 <BR>
      Iraqis would die. There are approximately <BR>
      24,000,000 people in Iraq-enough to fill<BR>
      320 Tampa Stadiums. So each individual Iraqi<BR>
      would have a 1 in 48 chance of being seated <BR>
      in a stadium in which everyone will die. <BR>
      The odds of having won $1 playing SuperLotto<BR>
      in California last week were almost exactly the same.</FONT></P>
