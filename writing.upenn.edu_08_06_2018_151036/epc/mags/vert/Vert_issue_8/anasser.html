      An Attempt at a Poem for New York</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Translated by Sarah Maguire</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">---------------------------------
      <B>I</B> ---------------------------------</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But before what happened had
      happened -<BR>
      I mean, before those towers were turned into twin lifts to the
      apocalypse,<BR>
      sundering the world into two worlds: one world of sand, one world
      of water -</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I wanted to be <BR>
      one of those poets<BR>
      who blasted New York.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Truth is, I'd already written
      this poem in my head.<BR>
      Part of that distinguished tradition, after Lorca -<BR>
      driven by Whitman rather than Gibran -</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Lorca who taught us to fire
      poems like darts<BR>
      deep in the great apple's flesh -<BR>
      that cobra of money and sex, that vast Babeltower of newness
      and nowness -</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">and all without tossing our
      cigarette butts in the Hudson,<BR>
      without jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge,<BR>
      or jiving away the jazzwailing lightningcrashing black nights
      of Harlem.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You see, we know that the Statue
      of Liberty was designed for the Suez Canal,<BR>
      that her face is the face of a young Egyptian peasant -<BR>
      and we know when the Egyptians went bankrupt to the muzak of
      Aida,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">that they sold her down the
      river -<BR>
      across the Sea of Darkness (as they called it, an omen) <BR>
      to that newland fattening its wealth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">So what does it matter <BR>
      if poets take the subway while watching their backs,<BR>
      or if they've not even passed through the gates to that underworld?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Why not try your hand<BR>
      at making up New York, at mocking New York,<BR>
      the final lines cutting to that sodomandgomorrah ending?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Why bother setting eyes on the
      cards being stacked,<BR>
      or the blacktears of the Blacks,<BR>
      as love goes up in smoke?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Why bother witnessing the scuzzyfeathered
      pigeons - <BR>
      New York's very own doves, good for nothing, bad for peace -<BR>
      screeching down the stonework, from the stoneye of the storm?</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">---------------------------------
      <B>II</B>---------------------------------</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Truth is, I've never been to
      America.<BR>
      Like everyone else, it's entered my bloodstream in films, in
      dreams, and in wars...<BR>
      and, battered by its coruscating caterwauling metallic machines</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">its riverfulls of blood, its
      deserts of drought,<BR>
      I've been left with just the dregs of two real emotions:<BR>
      Love, and Hate.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Truth is, even when I once fetched
      up in Canada<BR>
      I completely ignored my brother Ahmad's call -<BR>
      poor Ahmad whom Fate tossed from the westcoast to the eastcoast,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">who clung onto his life behind
      the reinforced security glass of the gas station<BR>
      while his workmate was gunned down right by his side -<BR>
      I never returned Ahmad's call,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I turned my back on my brother<BR>
      because I feared that entering Upper Manhattan<BR>
      would fuck up my masterpiece, my New York epic, its big sound
      and fury</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">just coming to the boil, rather
      nicely,<BR>
      on my slow fires<BR>
      of hate..........................................................................................................................</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But after what happened had
      happened -<BR>
      I mean after 9/11<BR>
      after the year of those two false prophets and their sham Satanic
      conjurings,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">after the shock of fissured
      epistemology, of metaphysical shatterings,<BR>
      when man was gobsmacked to discover<BR>
      that, despite all that posturing,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">his hands had never been wings
      in the first place, <BR>
      but were just a pair of question marks -<BR>
      after what happened had happened</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I came to the conclusion<BR>
      my New York poem<BR>
      was history.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">So, the city will be spared,
      at least for the present,<BR>
      yet another mocking masterpiece in verse<BR>
      sounding off about its stuckup uptight tightarsed complacencies..................................</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">.......................................................................................................<BR>
      ....................................................................................<BR>
      ..................................................</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Fanfare. Endgame. Curtains.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">- But, hold on, maybe I can
      come up with another attempt at an ending:<BR>
      Maybe, if New York wants to know why what happened<BR>
      has happened,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">we should all remember that
      proverb:<BR>
      What goes around<BR>
      comes around.</FONT></P>
