      the notebook made while driving from <BR>
      Bloomington IL to Providence RI  and back to visit my partner
      Mair&eacute;ad Byrne <BR>
      and our two daughters, Marina and Clio, in late February, early
      March of <BR>
      2003. All words were written at 70 miles per hour.  Normal IL
      is 1097 miles <BR>
      fr Providence RI. 1755 kilometers. It takes 17 hrs to drive at
      an ave speed <BR>
      of 67 mph stopping 3 times for ten minutes a piece to gas and
      urinate my <BR>
      pee.  At 67 mph I can get between 43 and 46 mpg in my Toyota
      ECHO depending <BR>
      upon temperature, wind, and altitude. I place a large format
      Cachet drawing <BR>
      pad on the passenger's seat in which I write notes as I drive
      with a Sailor <BR>
      Innovation I millimeter gel pen, black. The following is a log
      of where I <BR>
      am, what I perceive, and what I'm thinking. The linebreaks are
      not a result <BR>
      of my intention to break a line but are there because when I
      am driving at <BR>
      70 mph and leaning over to write I write in dime-sized arthritic
      letters <BR>
      and that's all I could get onto the 16 inch wide page.  The stanza
      breaks <BR>
      are often simply where I turned the page. The &quot;M&quot; referred
      to is sometimes <BR>

      strong enough to taint most of the weather<BR>
