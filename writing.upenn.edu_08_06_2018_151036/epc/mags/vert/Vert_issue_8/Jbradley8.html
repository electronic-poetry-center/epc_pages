      I'm driving my boss to work, only I'm facing her, as the steering
      wheel<BR>
      is mounted behind the driver's seat. She's seated in the back
      seat,<BR>
      facing forward. Why don't I ask her where we're going, so I don't
      have<BR>
      to keep twisting my neck around? She could tell me which way
      to turn,<BR>
      and I could calmly gaze out the back window, chatting with her
      about<BR>
      those canoe-shaped cars they drive in that country we are about
      to<BR>
      pacify.</FONT></P>

      Here is a rule: We meet on a field that slightly resembles a
      field in<BR>
      that country where peace shall be consummated. You can commit
      any<BR>
      violence, any violence you wish, upon me. Until I say: Glorious
      is<BR>
      victory. Once I say those words, everything changes. Now I am
      free to<BR>
      commit whatever violence I can imagine upon you. Until you say:
      Sublime<BR>
      is victory.</FONT></P>

      After my wife takes a shower, the soapdish fills with water,
      and then<BR>
      the bar of soap begins to revert back to a liquid. When I enter
      the<BR>
      bathroom, I feel obligated to check the soapdish and empty any
      water I<BR>
      might find. I call this preserving our eroding coastline. I wonder
      if<BR>
      a husband or wife does this in the country we're about to overcome.
      I<BR>
      suppose it's better not to know. Otherwise I'd have to stop emptying<BR>
      our soapdish.</FONT></P>

      A notebook is found inside a flounder caught off the coast of
      Biloxi. <BR>
      Though little is known about the notebook, some say it contains
      the<BR>
      ravings of a citizen living in the country we are about to quell.
<BR>
      There's a grocery list for sunflower seeds and glockenspiel.
      Drawings<BR>
      of hands, with eyes on the fingertips, emerging from dry creek
      beds. <BR>
      Translations of dog bark and cricket call. Some argue this is
      all a<BR>
      ruse to make us feel sympathy for the enemy, but tell me, who
      could feel<BR>
      sympathy for someone who wrote in his journal: Then the Chihuahua
      asked<BR>
      me, What star are we on, kind sir?</FONT></P>

      Here is a rule: Never tell anyone that you wear red undergarments.
      Red<BR>
      might be the color of a spice of the favorite dish of that dictator
      of<BR>
      the country we are about to subdue, or it might be the color
      of the<BR>
      dictator's favorite wife's favorite scarf, or the color of the<BR>
      eyeglasses of his least favorite son. You can still wear red,
      of<BR>
      course. Only when you do, be more generous in your tips at the<BR>
      coffeehouse.</FONT></P>

      I made a terrible mistake. I made your tea without wearing rubber<BR>
      gloves. When I scalded myself while pouring the hot water, my
      throat<BR>
      released an unstoppable scream, implanting panic in your tea
      leaves. <BR>
      Causing your left kneecap, when you later hear someone say, That
      country<BR>
      we are about to render infantile, to inadvertently emit an audible
      gasp<BR>
      in public. I'm so sorry. The rubber gloves are in my sink. Punish<BR>
      them however you wish.</FONT></P>
