      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We know of course that war demolishes
      the field of aesthetics, but this destruction occurs not without
      an aesthetics of its own.  The war machine uses any available
      means at victory, raiding the icebox of art whenever it is deemed
      necessary.  Most infamously, the Nazis aestheticized their military
      regime to extremes, harnessing total social and cultural control
      to the cultivation of a Reich, generating brutal energy with
      a dialectic of myth and war.  But the Nazis were not an aberration
      in aestheticing the war machine, and probably since the beginnings
      of organized warfare the two spheres have been coupled not only
      for expedience but also in the name of enhanced experience. 
      War has always needed a vision of future aesthetic harmony for
      it not to cycle into chaotic bloodshed, and art has been deployed
      for furnishing creative battle schemes to developing the character
      of a soldier (the &quot;art of war&quot; is not a paradox). 
      In this tradition, Homer is the first major war poet.  Dactyllic
      hexameter is good for chanting and as a mnemonic technique, but
      perhaps such rhythms also correspond or derive from marches or
      other war rituals (at least Plato wished it so).  A second lineage
      of war poetry begins with Sappho's &quot;To an army wife, in
      Sardis&quot; in which she claims perhaps for the first time in
      the Western tradition that the highest praise in poetry is not
      for heroism in war but for fleeting beauty.  But in sum the majority
      of war poems memorialize some version of bravery in battle that
      correlates with social order.  Dryden appreciated the epic and
      lyric potential of Hobbes' <I>Leviathan</I>, whose war of all
      against all is actually a matrix for understanding all human
      affairs, as if war was a principle of our being.  If after World
      War I the true trauma of battle shattered any easy collaboration
      between war and art, the links still remain latent in the very
      idea of an avant-garde, which is after all a military term that
      puts art on the offensive.  The avant-garde mounts a militant
      aesthetic, proposing a cultural war of social and poetic means.
       If poetry were to totally dislocate itself from a war aesthetic,
      it also would have to go beyond the premise of an avant-garde.
       Thus it seems not at all obvious that war can do without poetry,
      nor can poetry do without war.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Today it is hard to tell whether
      a poet practices subversion by throwing herself on the gears
      of the machine, or whether it is the machine that lubricates
      itself with the grinding up of poetry.  Whichever the case, for
      now it seems that the very goodwill of poets and the promise
      of a better world through aesthetics has been deftly infiltrated
      by the war hawks who say they plan to delineate some vision of
      human order.  The most interesting poets now are developing creative
      counter-strategies that erect barriers against the further aestheticizing
      of war.  The poetry that seems most prescient right now is work
      that sucks the aesthetics out of war.  If war necessitates a
      co-optation of aesthetics, the best anti-war poetry of the last
      century has set out to de-aestheticize or even sabotage the poetic
      strategies that are employed by the war powers.  The poetic tropes
      that have now been swallowed in the routines of normalization
      and the juridics of violence are not to be liberated, but to
      be dismantled and disarmed in the name of a different kind of
      poetry.  Poetry is not fate; the taking apart of poetry does
      not portend an end to poetry but a process by which the field
      of poetry regenerates itself, unweaving the veils the moment
      they are in the politicians' hands.  The intended end effect
      is to render the concept and techniques of poetry as something
      wholly alternate to the poetics of war, such that over time the
      masters of war will find themselves with one less weapon.  And
      those who try to use the previous poetics in service of propaganda
      will find only that they have swallowed their own mouths.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many dissenting poets feel that
      the most powerful critique to be made is to expose the disconnection
      between what the government says it accomplishes versus the tremendous
      violence it delivers in localized zones and across international
      lines.  Poets recently have keyed on the difference of language
      used in reporting on multiple realities between huge capital-driven
      media outlets and smaller alternative media practices, but this
      conflict should not be allegorized into a war.  Alternate medias
      can supply previously suppressed data, yet the glaring abuses
      of the U.S. government are not due to ignorance but to reckless
      use of power.  The problem of the relation of media to the public
      is less a struggle over information as it is over attention.
       By and large, the public is aware of how the major media businesses
      offer one-sided coverage, especially when it is often the side
      they wish to hear.  The public also knows it is not a stretch
      to find alternate media sources, though many do not bother to
      listen because it seems boring, too negative, or too plaintive.
        A manipulated public that knows itself to be manipulated is
      no longer alienated in any simple formula, but has deemed receptivity
      to manipulation as a concession for an overall sense of convenience
      and security.  <BR>
<BR>
      	To repeat, the crisis is not over information but attention.
       In recent conversation with Louis Cabri and Jeff Derksen, they
      advocated a poetics based in part on holding close to a statement
      from Louis Zukofsky that &quot;Poetry is information.&quot; 
       Though Cabri's granular lines of poetry posit a very different
      visual and verbal apparatus from Derksen's narrative sentences,
      I understood both to be arguing for a poetry that is supported
      by irreducible facts of world socio-economics, which poetry accesses
      at the level of formal structure as well as educative content.
       Though Cabri's work is deeply intensified by his reading of
      Zukofsky in connection with contemporary social metrics, it is
      hard to make the case that Zukofsky meant his statement in terms
      what has become the current landscape of information, alternate
      medias included.  Zukofsky's generation witnessed the corporatization
      of information in the U.S. where &quot;news that stays news&quot;
      became most apt as an advertising slogan.  It is of little importance
      what Zukofsky thought of the phenomenon of &quot;the media,&quot;
      though his poems reflect a hunger for information that is akin
      to Ezra Pound's eye for detail despite the delusions of grandeur.
       What Zukofsky's poetry evokes (and what Cabri also engages)
      is an attention to that which lacks information, fails to make
      news, or slips through the grids of any report.  Yet the value
      here is not in moving such information from lost to found, but
      in the way poetry <I>intensifies the relation of</I> <I>both
      lost and found</I>.  In the poem from the early 1960's &quot;THE
      OLD POET MOVES TO A NEW APARTMENT 14 TIMES&quot;,  Zukofsky writes
      14 window-like sections, through which one gets a glimpse of
      poetry like this:<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The location of poetry is somehow
      between the missing or failed information and the urgency of
      knowing &quot;<I>Their</I> names,&quot; capitalized and italicized
      with the hot breath of the students but still left in anonymous
      collectivity.  Information as such does not contain within the
      seeds of conflict resolution or social transformation.  Information
      posits both loss and gain, knowing does not always breed action,
      concentration seems to be the dialectical link between the two.
       Poetry has an addictive relation to information but its ability
      to strain, magnify, and recompose allow it to separate itself
      from the arena of competing information systems, in the way that
      a thief, once hold of his bread, slips away to share the food
      with his shady company.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With the onset of the current
      war in Iraq there has been a proliferation of anti-war poems,
      most employing the value of the poetic as the very base of protest.
       En masse these poems imitate a kind of public march.  At the
      same time these mass conscriptions of poets form a density of
      dissent that is intended to jostle consciousness, they also conjure
      other collective symptoms, the obvious one being the reduction
      of critique to streamlined slogans.  One trend within poetry
      (avant-garde or conservative) has been increased reliance on
      repetition and the rhythm of rallying.  On the one hand these
      tropes help intensify the collective attitude of protest, yet
      there is simultaneously an indication that such repetition carries
      its own sense of security.  One expects poems against the war
      and one is not to be denied, as if it were as important to confirm
      this expectation as it is to dissent against the war.  The institution
      of opinion has not been violated, yet the war is fought in the
      name of respectful differences.  <BR>
<BR>
      	A familiar anxiety permeates the pamphlets of the Marxist critic
      Paul Goodman, who wrote on the crisis of war and capital at the
      later stages of World War II.  Goodman comes to mind in particular
      because I think he offers further analysis of some of the things
      at stake in the &quot;Social Mark&quot; gathering.  Goodman,
      eyeing how the closing chapters of the war indicated that what
      was mostly at stake was not saving innocents from the death camps
      but the solidification of new world power regimes, lashed out
      against war as an extension of state policy that had long been
      disconnected from human needs.  In response to the growing sense
      that the government and big business intended to convert the
      social into an empty form of group identity evacuated of any
      autonomy, Goodman converted the term &quot;sociolatry&quot; from
      August Comte into a critique of the ideology of public manipulation:<BR>
<BR>
      Sociolatry is the concern felt by masses alienated from their
      deep natures for the smooth functioning of the industrial machine
      from which they believe they can get a higher standard of living
      and enjoy it in security.  The revolutionary tension of the people
      is absorbed and sublimated by the interesting standard of living;...
      it is a sociological standard energized by emulation and advertising,
      and cementing a sense of unanimity among the alienated.... <BR>
      On the part of the political elite: sociolatry is the agreement
      of the bourgeoisie to become <I>rentiers</I> of the industrial
      corporation in whose working they do not interfere; and the promotion
      of the more dynamic bourgeoisie to high-salaried, prestigious,
      and powerful places at the controls of the machine.  Sociolatry
      is therefore the psychology of state capitalism and state socialism.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Part of the critique here is
      that any mass movement has given itself over to a collective
      ideology that cannot fail to be somehow alienating in its very
      &quot;unanimity&quot;.  This is not to deny global movements
      of social change, but to admit that mass speech also carries
      within itself a kind of mass logic prone to be muted or stuck
      in echo.  Sociolatry is how the bourgeoisie reproduces and strengthens
      itself within real yet false forms of collectivity.  The large
      corporate office is as collective as the street protest (here
      the objectives are widely different but often the methods are
      similar), but Goodman warns that both are relatively distant
      from the bonds of friendship, personal responsibility, and the
      fulfillment of basic human needs that always fundamentally unite
      people.  Goodman then advocates forums of intimacy and clusters
      of close relations as the sites from which to build social change:
      &quot;Then, as opposed to the radical programs that already presuppose
      the great state and corporative structure, and the present social
      institutions in the perfected form of Sociolatry, we must &shy;
      in small groups &shy; draw the line and try action more directly
      satisfactory to our deep nature&quot; (35).<BR>
<BR>
      One of the most menacing recent developments in sociolatry has
      been to yoke social needs to &quot;security&quot; as defined
      by the state and now is proliferating into previously private
      transactions and generating business based on fear (thus the
      maintenance on elevators becomes a question of <I>security</I>,
      meaning you should contact the large company that made the elevator
      so you can purchase a new one).  The idea of &quot;social security&quot;
      suddenly takes an ominous turn.  The modern welfare system grew
      out of the practice of actuarial studies of risk analysis of
      accidents and death rates.  One of the more critical operations
      within aesthetics is to dislocate the idea of welfare and redistribution
      away from the current militarization of government.  The social
      is not the security.  The social grows out of the life of humans
      who share needs and concerns; radical action does not grow out
      of collectivity in the abstract but inter-personal responsibility.
       Poetry is not a competing form of information so much as it
      is a corridor between information and human needs, somewhat akin
      to the fluctuating shore at seas' edge of a different world.</FONT></P>
