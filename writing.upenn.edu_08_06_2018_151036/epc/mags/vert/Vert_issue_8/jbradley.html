      Fall Fragments: One Year After</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Over southern Iraq a pilot looks
      down <BR>
      and wonders if those carpenter ants are back<BR>
      in his living room crawling over his CDs<BR>
      world atlas family photos if a bomb fell<BR>
      on his home would the ants remain<BR>
      or would it be finally free of invasion?<BR>
<BR>
      Do you mind? the airport security guard <BR>
      asks holding up his Star Trek wand<BR>
      question? command? I listen to his wand scan<BR>
      my shoe soles and wonder what would happen <BR>
      if it said I'd stepped in doubt and confusion<BR>
      Tom Jefferson one of your ribs is missing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A tall building's shadow resembles
      a channel<BR>
      filled with solid water water like a tower<BR>
      on its side what if when the tower's gone<BR>
      the building's shadow remains spreads <BR>
      heavy hungry can be seen in far away<BR>
      village huts in caves inside of caves. <BR>
<BR>
      The President is running hard his blood <BR>
      pressure like a young man's he can swallow <BR>
      any poison the prodigal son confesses<BR>
      his sins to a goat sets it loose in the desert<BR>
      his father finds a stray takes it in his herd<BR>
      sickens all die but for the homely stray.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Where is the book with the names
      of all those<BR>
      taken when towers fell when Pentagon <BR>
      crumbled the book with the names of all those <BR>
      erased in Afghanistan a name for every brown <BR>
      detained face whose names we cannot <BR>
      know the book with a slug stuck to the cover?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">On the radio a woman says we
      once believed<BR>
      the soul dwelled in the skull in thigh bone<BR>
      now zeroed ground is clear Pentagon repaired<BR>
      what is our want? what will that want demand?<BR>
      The contrails over my house read like broken letters<BR>
      O to float over Chicago like a slip of corn silk.</FONT></P>
