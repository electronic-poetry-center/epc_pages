      set to be eaten <BR>
      (and crispy girl all dressed with scarf for school),<BR>
      what are you doing near this shovel for dung-digging,<BR>
      hissing like ice-cubes in ruins of little museum?</FONT></P>

      on mailman's truck,<BR>
      truck with ashes of letter from crispy girl all dressed with
      scarf for<BR>
      school,<BR>
      why do you seem like American experimental poets going nowhere<BR>
      on little exercise bikes?</FONT></P>

      mosque): He stumbles up Martyr's Promenade. What does it matter
<BR>
      who is speaking, he murmurs and mutters, head a little bit on
      fire. <BR>
      Good night to you too.)</FONT></P>
