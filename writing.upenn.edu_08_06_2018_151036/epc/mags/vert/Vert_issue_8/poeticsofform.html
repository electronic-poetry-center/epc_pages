        on the politics of form</FONT></B></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The first
        of the following two commentaries was published in The Possum
        Pouch in March, 2003. It provoked a number of defensive reactions,
        in different places, from poets associated with Language writing.
        The follow-up commentary was posted at Circulars and distributed
        in other venues, and it, in turn, generated some angry responses,
        most notably from Barrett Watten. The issues remain open, of
        course.</FONT></I></B></P>

        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Bernstein's
        &quot;Enough!&quot; </FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In his statement
        for the &quot;Enough!&quot; reading* held on March 9 at The Bowery
        Club, in celebration of O Books's anthology of the same title,
        Charles Bernstein proclaims the following:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;As poets,
        we need to pursue our own forms of ethical and aesthetic response
        rather than engage in the sort of pronouncement by fiat and moral
        presumption of President Bush and his partisans.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At first blush,
        any poet alarmed by the imperial policies of the new national
        security state could hardly disagree: Of course poets should
        honestly follow the paths of their own forms of ethical and aesthetic
        response Poets of all different stripes are doing so, in response
        to the coming war, in inspiringly multifarious ways And truly,
        yes, it is harmful to dismiss discourses other than your own
        through presumptuous decree </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But it soon becomes
        clear that the <I>real, </I>unnamed target of Bernstein's cry
        of &quot;Enough!&quot; is not the moral arrogance of the Bush
        administration, but the &quot;righteous monologue&quot; and &quot;digestible
        messages,&quot; as he puts it, of the thousands of poems appearing
        at Sam Hamill's amazingly popular <I>Poets Against the War</I>
        site. And when one realizes this and pauses to reflect on Bernstein's
        brief manifesto, one wants to ask: Has there ever been, in the
        young history of 21st century American poetry, a moral decree
        more astonishingly blind to the ironies of its own arrogance?
        The moral righteousness is so obvious, in fact, that one wonders
        if Bernstein is not perhaps pulling a trademark funny one on
        his audience.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Alas, he's quite
        serious. Quoting Bush that America's purpose is to achieve &quot;results,&quot;
        Bernstein retorts that such authoritative decree &quot;alone
        provides sufficient evidence to oppose his policies. What our
        America stands on, its foundation, is a commitment to process
        over results, to finding by doing, to thinking by responding.
        Solutions made outside of an open-ended process compound whatever
        problems we face.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yes, indeed.
        But there's no room for &quot;an open-ended process,&quot; it
        appears, when it comes to discovering the different kinds of
        poetry that might be fit and effective for the times-- fit and
        effective for those different reading communities of citizens
        that make up our nation, not all of whom share Bernstein's aesthetic
        tastes: For Bernstein, in fact, any poetic discourse against
        the impending war, if it is to be of value &shy;or, even, if
        it is not to be complicit with the powers that be-- must eschew
        the &quot;language of social and linguistic norms&quot; and demonstrate,
        instead, measures of &quot;ambiguity,&quot; &quot;complexity,&quot;
        and &quot;skepticism&quot; capable of exploring the ways such
        norms &quot;are used to discipline and contain dissent&quot;-as
        if these last three qualities were the exclusive domain of a
        particular literary current. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Those who have
        been following the discussion in &quot;innovative&quot; poetic
        circles about poetry's role in the current period should be able
        to see that Bernstein intends his statement, in part, as a response
        to Eliot Weinberger's talk of a few weeks back at the Poetry
        Project. In characteristically clear and pointed address, Weinberger
        reminded his listeners, not all of whom were happy to hear it,
        that nearly all great and lasting anti-war poetry (that of the
        Vietnam war, for recent and stirring example) is overtly political
        and written in language that approximates the &quot;norm&quot;
        (again, Bernstein's accusatory term)-a poetry, that is, that
        lends itself to ways of reading that are closer to the &quot;norm&quot;
        than those demanded by a poetics of abstract surface and self-reflexive
        speculation. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That this is
        so is quite simply a matter of history, and it's clear that this
        touches a nerve for Bernstein, since it runs directly counter
        to the claims of radical relevance that Language poetry has made
        for itself since Robert Grenier wrote <BR>
        &quot;I HATE SPEECH&quot;. Indeed, the relative silence from
        old-guard Language poets in the present crisis (the younger &quot;post-avants&quot;
        they have often scolded for not being &quot;political&quot; enough
        are the ones now engaged in forging a poetics of activism) begins
        to suggest that their &quot;ambiguous,&quot; &quot;complex,&quot;
        &quot;skeptical&quot; and, increasingly, academically-contextualized
        poetics really has little to currently offer beyond prescriptive
        pronouncements like Bernstein's-- pronouncements that fundamentally
        <I>conflate ethics and aesthetics,</I> and which, in so doing,
        preempt any idea of democratic dialogue and political unity within
        the multifarious poetic community. Thus does Bernstein, in his
        statement, show himself to be exclusivist and fundamentalist
        in his poetics, and --in his superior ideological dispensations-an
        ironic after-echo of the intolerant rulers he would oppose. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Times of quickening
        crisis famously clarify things previously obscured by cultural
        inertia. In this particular time, an &quot;avant-garde&quot;
        circle, long insistent of the vanguard nature of its theory and
        practice, is being shown to be more or less pulling up the cultural
        rear. And its members' patronizing snipes against poets speaking
        out with courage and force are starting to sound like sour-grape
        complaints about being left behind.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To them, a simple
        suggestion: Enough.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On March 30,
        Nick Piombino posted the following on his blog, Fait Accompli:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;David Hess
        and Jim Behrle have weighed in on Barrett Watten's call for a
        critique and analysis of the reasons the present administration
        have given us for going to war (see -Circulars-). All have ignored
        the quiet voice of Masha Zavialova whose recent statements on
        the list were the most cogent because she lived through all this
        in the Soviet Union. Masha feels there is real work to do for
        poets in &quot;taking the shit&quot; off what our leaders have
        to say. But this will take even more time, as poets have immediately
        clashed as to how to go about working together. One group wants
        to deconstruct what has been said in order to become more constructive,
        the other group wants us to say or do something more constructive
        right away. Are these positions very far apart?&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Nick's plaintive
        question, &quot;Are these positions very far apart?&quot; seems
        a strange one to ask.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">He has been reading
        the poetry news, and he certainly must know that at the heart
        of this growing discussion is the notion, clearly conveyed in
        recent statements by proponents of the &quot;deconstructive&quot;
        approach (most prominently Silliman, Bernstein, &amp; Watten),
        that a certain &quot;advanced&quot; poetic practice --one which
        self-consciously takes the ideological status of language as
        thematic sine qua non-- is of greater social, historical, and
        political value than the more formally conventional kinds of
        responses that have flourished in the U.S. poetry world (notably
        via PAW) in response to the imperialist war. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The statements,
        in fact (see Bernstein's &quot;Enough&quot; and entries at Silliman's
        Blog on the &quot;poetry of quietude&quot;), have been stunningly
        haughty, quite open in suggesting that anti-war poets who write
        in &quot;mainstream&quot; modes--who use, in Bernstein's disdainful
        terms, &quot;righteous monologue&quot; and &quot;digestible messages&quot;--
        inevitably play into the hands of those forces that would &quot;discipline
        and contain dissent.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This elitist
        posture, as I pointed out in earlier response, is frankly embarrassing.
        Moreover, and more consequentially, it stimulates sectarian division
        just when the building of dialogic strategies and ethics in the
        cultural community is an urgent matter; it projects the &quot;superior&quot;
        nature of one relatively small poetic formation, ignoring, against
        all evidence, that the forms of poetic resistance that most writers
        and readers make use of in times of political exigency are ordered
        from the forms of everyday language-- forms which naturally tend
        to be pointed outward in addresses of partisan reference, and
        not inward in deconstructive analyses of cultural ideologemes.
        Given this fact, some fairly obvious questions could be posed
        to Watten, et. al. : Whose poetry was, or is, more &quot;politically&quot;
        relevant:  Stein's or Neruda's? Zukofsky's or Hikmet's? Mallarme's
        or Brecht's? Was Vallejo wrong to abandon the hermetic poetry
        of _Trilce_ when he wrote the great popular poetry collected
        in _Espana, aparta de mi este caliz_? Does, say, Owen's &quot;Dulce
        et Decorum Est&quot; have the effect of disciplining dissent
        because it is written in a prosody and syntax similar to that
        used by Kipling or other pro-imperial poets?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That's not to
        suggest that the poetry of a Stein or Zukofsky is without political
        value, nor, much less, that the kinds of writing practices advocated
        by the first-generation Language poets are irrelevant. To the
        contrary-- their poetry and criticism has much to contribute.
        But culture (it's a somewhat obvious proposition) is informed
        by a diversity of reading formations, and these negotiate and
        manipulate their semiotic environments in complex and mutually
        impacting ways. An effective poetics of resistance will be likewise
        diverse, and informed (at least provisionally) by attitudes of
        mutual tolerance and respect. Call it a Total Syntax of Poetic
        Resistance-- one that recognizes axiological values as fluid,
        contingent, and not necessarily counterposed in their utilities,
        and which refuses, consequently, to grant  privilege to any particular
        mode of compositional attention.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But in that regard,
        the so-called avant-garde in American poetry is far away, right
        now, from leading the way.</FONT></P>
