    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">The Possible may just
    be the key to the world we want to exist, and, through our wanting
    it, we might open the door to the first world. &quot;The first
    world&quot; not necessarily that which originates all things,
    but where things can be discovered <I>as if</I> they are now
    existing for the first time. The &quot;as if&quot; is key here,
    because it, as the Possible, is the key the artist-idealist holds
    in his/her hand which unlocks the actuality of art as a methodology
    of what is produced as a creative object. When Wordsworth spoke
    of the &quot;Imagination&quot;, he meant to reach something with
    the mind he could not reach in the world -- that's why, in the
    <I>Prelude</I>, when he misses the mountaintop because he's not
    paying attention to the landscape but to his own inner impossibility,
    he recreates the mountain in the poem, &quot;more&quot; of a
    mountain because of his desire to see it and his failure at having
    seen it. But Eleni Sikelianos, in <I>Earliest Worlds</I>, reconfigures
    the Possible as a subject of writing and, consequently, the object
    of contemplation that writing attends to and attempts to unlock.
    The attempt is also key, because Possibility is made actuality
    through the act of approaching. <BR>
    I keep using the verb &quot;unlock&quot; because the book itself
    acts as a chamber where ideas are stored within poetic fictions
    (but one doesn't &quot;unearth&quot; them &shy; they reveal themselves
    as poetry). The &quot;deep crypt&quot; of Poe's &quot;Cask of
    Amontillado&quot; comes to mind. (In that story, revenge is the
    Possible made &quot;actual&quot; by writing, but it reverts to
    the Possible because &quot;no mortal has disturbed the bones&quot;
    since the narrator has committed the murder. Sikelianos' poems
    seek a similar immortality.) But there's no &quot;revenge&quot;
    upon people here, or even the world; instead, Sikelianos attacks
    the acts of both lyric and narrative by approaching the &quot;I&quot;
    with a caution that is both patient and tenacious because it
    does not rest upon an ending that ends the Possible. It's a tentative
    &quot;I&quot; to the extent that its narrator cannot decide exactly
    what to say -- &quot;<I>First I go up, then I go down, sometimes
    I go up or down again. Sometimes there is a town, sometimes a
    small walled city, sometimes a drugstore and a stop to the left</I>&quot;
    -- but this indecision may lead back to the fact that the &quot;truth&quot;
    of a thing does not exclude what contradicts it; the possibility
    of truth relates exclusively to what truth allows into it. Narration
    may very well be the perfect contradiction that lays writing
    bare, because the lie cannot be detected. That's how I take the
    &quot;ticket of lights&quot;, hardly illuminating the walls,
    like Poe's flambeaux, which &quot;glow rather than flame&quot;.
    The glow produces a brilliant illusion of wall, of thing, based
    on the irreality of partially seeing and needing to imagine to
    then fully see.<BR>
    &quot;Lyric&quot; has never been opposed to &quot;narrative&quot;,
    but the divisions, from the position of the writer, remain, as
    one mode hearkens back to the &quot;I&quot;'s truth while the
    other pushes to believe in the sequential order of events. Sikelianos'
    double-truth is that a cloud chamber is a place of discovery
    -- the science that makes The Possible possible -- and a place
    of impossibility -- the betrayal of the actual object by apparent
    movement. So when, in the second part of the book, the &quot;I&quot;
    begins to push a belated, and almost excessive, confidence through
    the material, the storytelling aspect of the &quot;I&quot; gains
    full force, because &quot;at the most remote end of the crypt
    there appeared another less spacious&quot; --</FONT></P>

    -- space narrows as the Possible emerges. The Possible's emergence
    is what changes space as something contingent upon what it contains.
    Space, in the above, contains &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;think&quot;
    and &quot;sung&quot; and &quot;sunk&quot; and &quot;thung&quot;
    which all lead to &quot;you&quot;, follow the narrative trail
    to &quot;you&quot;, who are always poetic, you give poetry back
    to itself because you are the Most Possible.<BR>
    I don't mean this is a &quot;story&quot;, that this is the &quot;story&quot;
    of &quot;you&quot; -- I mean &quot;storytelling&quot; in the
    way of the following sentence -- &quot;Yet all he could think
    of was running away&quot; (is running away what is being &quot;thought&quot;
    or being &quot;done&quot;? So what's possible about this sentence?)
    -- what Peter Handke calls &quot;the rhythm of narrative&quot;.
    This rhythm is inherent in Sikelianos' repetitions, which fall
    all over each other, stumbling from line to line like the act
    of looking for something to say by saying the same thing until
    it spills over into another word or unlocks the possible world
    of that word, or displaces one word's parts with that of another
    because each word is the other's Possible. This is a peculiar
    grace -- like Wordsworth's catching himself by renaming his experience
    in writing. Because The Possible is only accessed by the repeating
    the impossible, a door that does not open but which must be approached
    by knocking on it. And then the door does open -- poetry contains
    philosophy and itself and the coupling of the actual form of
    what we build (architecture), but only to come back to itself
    to announce itself as real:</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">Poetry reveals a power
    of the unknown. But the unknown is only an insignificant void
    if it is not the object of a desire. Poetry is a middle term,
    it conceals the known within the unknown: it is the unknown painted
    in blinding colors, in the image of a sun. <BR>
    George Bataille, <I>The Impossible</I></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">What is to be found out
    is what is impossible, like knowing the <I>Earliest Worlds </I>without
    also not knowing them for the &quot;I&quot; one believes oneself
    to be. In &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, it is when Fortunato
    stops screaming that Montresor, the narrator, becomes aware of
    what he has done. But this awareness is the supreme silence of
    having done what is possible, which is no longer the Possible,
    but what cannot be undone. In <I>Earliest Worlds</I>, poetry
    is the act of a narrator who undoes the story that s/he might
    tell and the lyric &quot;I&quot; s/he might have been in order
    to unearth what comes earlier than these divisions, the world
    that precedes writing, but which we can only access through writing,
    the earliest of all Possibles, what's happening now, at the moment
    of reading, and is always changing.</FONT></P>
