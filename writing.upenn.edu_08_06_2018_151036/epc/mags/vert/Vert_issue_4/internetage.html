    Age</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">by Patrick Herron</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Introduction<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Years ago in a film criticism

    class I learned that artistic genres and movements seem to have

    four general phases of their lifecycles: introduction, a classic

    period, a parodic period, and a revision period. Today it appears

    Language poetry may have been in its classic period for a long

    time. Language poetry and radical contemporary poetry/poetics

    also seem to be names for the revision of modernism, apparently

    still correcting modernism's &quot;mistakes.&quot; The Internet

    has drastically transformed the cultural &amp; artistic substrata

    of contemporary radical poetics. Such changes have introduced

    a new radical poetics, a radicalism quietly evolving out of Language

    poetry, a radicalism making poetry in some ways less syntactically

    disjoint, but perhaps more lyrical, more gestic, more interested

    in narrative (albeit disjoint), more interested in content and

    less in form, and even more ambiguous (more possibilities for

    meaning). The radical successor of Language poetry appears to

    be even more critical of the self, the author, &amp; solipsism

    than much of Language poetry. The reader, in this more contemporary

    form of radicalism, doesn't have any easier of a time, as the

    intellectual difficulty of Language poetry is subtly being replaced

    by the emotional difficulties of ambiguous and confrontational

    and sometimes even unfriendly language. Ironically, the radicalism

    of such a poetics, despite both the un-radical nature of the

    Internet and radical poetics' criticism of Internet &amp; mass

    culture, will likely come to us from the Internet.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Contemporary market &amp; industrial

    Western culture has slowly engulfed much of the radical forms

    of Language poetry (and postmodernism as a whole) largely via

    the Internet. Modern mainstream culture has accomplished this

    though the Internet by co-opting postmodern/Language poetry's

    disjunction and radical structuralism. Such assimilation can

    be seen in the Internet-dominant &amp; structurally complex forms

    of marketing and personalization. As a result, attempts at poetry

    in the flavor of Language poetry such as hypertext literature

    on the Internet seem less and less radical, perhaps even as empty

    as the empty signifiers much of Language poetry seeks to criticize.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The shift of our culture's artistic

    focus to the Internet has underscored the need for the parody

    &amp; revision of Language poetry. It also compels us to discover

    amidst the weeds of dominant artistic culture (whether &quot;indie&quot;

    or &quot;mainstream&quot;) the introduction of some new poetic

    genre or movement--a new movement or genre based on a healthy

    and appreciative response to Language poetry, a movement that

    seeks to maintain a position of anti-authoritarianism in light

    of a radically altered sociopolitical and cultural landscape

    now heavily influenced by the Internet.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I wish to carefully enumerate

    what we are looking for in this mess of things I write about

    here. I am suggesting we might want to begin looking for parodies

    and revisions of Language poetry. We might even want to search

    for the introduction of something new in poetics that maintains

    a subversive position in relation to the new cultural landscape

    dominated more and more by the World Wide Web (WWW). We might

    even wish to search for parodies, revisions, and new responses

    not only to Language poetry, but also to contemporary poetry

    as a whole, and hypertext &quot;innovations&quot; on the Internet.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some Reservations<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Before I proceed any

    further I wish to share two small caveats. Generalizations about

    things such as &quot;radical&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot;

    and Language Poetry and other such broad terms are tricky and

    awkward to wield, and they neglect many exceptions to their apparent

    rules. I am using the terms to help imagine the trajectory of

    radical poetry; the content of this essay is perhaps at least

    as speculative as these pivotal but elusive terms. Also, perhaps

    as a result of the speculative nature of this essay as well as

    its cursory nature, I will share very few examples of what I

    believe is coming along in radical poetics, and none of the examples

    seem quite complete or exhaustive.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language Poetry and Radicalism<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language poetry seemed

    able for a long time to subvert its contemporary cultural realities

    via radical disjunction, revealing the emptiness of mainstream

    cultural signifiers, and making gestures towards the disappearance

    of the author. But Language poetry, by taking upon itself the

    missions of radical disjunction and signifier disposal, emptied

    out language in the minds of even the most sophisticated readers

    of poetry. For many, language seems to have <I>something</I>

    to it, even if that something is elusive or difficult to name,

    and so it feels easy for many to summarily dismiss Language poetry.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I must first insist that just

    because many people insist upon the validity of a belief that

    there is something &quot;to&quot; language doesn't make it so.

    Language poetry, by that account alone, maintains its relevance.

    There are of course many other reasons for its continuing relevance.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language poetry for many seems

    to render communication difficult if not impossible. Poetry <I>needed</I>

    a breakdown of communication and Language poetry provided that

    much-needed noise; poetry had become, in the minds of many poets

    young and old, somewhat placid and dull, somewhat too full of

    clarity, too friendly to the reader, perhaps so conciliatory

    in more and more obvious ways that much innovation vanished and

    poetic culture was complicit perhaps tacitly with the state of

    the world and with both language and literature. Language poetry

    pushed poetics away from such social complicity into a radicalism

    essential to poetry.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the Internet age, however,

    we may require something a little different from Language poetry

    in order to maintain some amount of radicalism. Why is Language

    poetry no longer as radical as it once was? And, what is that

    very thing that is different, that helps poetry continue to have

    a home in radical poetics?</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Postmodern Essay and the

    Hyperlink<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The dominant form of

    contemporary literature is palimpsest. Palimpsest employs as

    many connections as possible to justify and legitimize one's

    own work, giving that work variety and support. Such work seems

    insecure, as if the writer must rely on the established authority

    of others. Hypertext has become the perfect way to implement

    such a multitude of connections in creative work.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The literary style of palimpsest

    may have become the dominant form of contemporary literature

    because design is central to the Internet. One must know all

    of his/her pieces s/he is about to put out on the web in order

    to do something that will not annoy the crud out of people or

    sent them away from the site. Literary works, it seems, need

    to be designed, strategized, and laid out, just as any other

    web site. The coherence of such work is often presupposed by

    the author to be an emergent property of the designed sequence

    of text. Any work done in this manner rests upon the reader's

    intuition, the reader's actual mindfulness and 'heartfulness,'

    so-to-speak. A hypertext-ed work with links going everywhere

    rarely feels coherent, often because the reader departs before

    the argument is completely absorbed or read, or perhaps because

    conceptual coherence arises out of more linear structures.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hypertext Again<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Children's book publishers

    and computer games manufacturers innovated polyvalent text linkage

    structures in the 1980s in the children's book series &quot;Choose

    Your Own Adventure&quot; and in text computer games like &quot;Zork&quot;.

    The Internet originally promised and still promises mainly to

    allow people to <I>disseminate</I> and <I>track</I> information

    rapidly, quietly, efficiently, and widely, all without paper.

    The content that appears on the Internet is produced independently

    of its means for delivery. Radical form, since it is a product

    of text and <I>not</I> a product of the <I>dissemination</I>

    of text, would and still will be innovated <I>regardless</I>

    of the existence of the Internet. The Internet makes multiple-choice

    narratives easy to complete, but it could also be easily done

    in a book before the days of the WWW &quot;revolution.&quot;</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Technology is not some automatic

    radicalizer. If anything, given that rapid and frequent introduction

    of new technologies drives our current market/capital hell; using

    technology as the justification for being &quot;radical&quot;

    seems completely absurd.<B> </B>If you want radical writing,

    radical form, such writing can be captured without the Internet

    in every case. With pencil and paper or even with a flipbook

    of stapled paper. Perhaps the speed of production will be compromised

    if the pieces are put in a book instead of on the Internet, but

    speed to delivery should not be essential to a discussion of

    innovating radical forms.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Use of the Electronically-Generated

    Poem<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Poetry on the web is

    only now &quot;catching up&quot; to the rest of the Internet

    culture in terms of technological sophistication. Perhaps not

    many poetry web sites offer personalization schemes, but there

    is a significant poetic art form on the web that is analogous

    to the personalized web page: the personalized poem.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The personalized poem, of which

    there are many examples on the Internet, is a poem where the

    user, via mouse clicks or keyboard tappings, enters some information

    into a web application, and, PRESTO! The user gets hir very own

    poem, a <I>bona fide</I> original.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Such a preprogrammed personalized

    poem is the mirror image of Internet control and domination.

    The personalized poem application, in whatever form it is in,

    is entirely predictable in its output, and those outputs are

    completely determined by the actions of one individual: the programmer.

    The person behind the black box. Sometimes, frankly, we're too

    busy looking at this black box to see the person who runs it

    or the implications of it. The programmer is in control of such

    poetry. The poet/programmer is obscured by distance and complexity,

    a modern-day Wizard of Oz of sorts, and the poetry is deterministic

    despite the randomness of human input. That programmer has a

    remote and invisible authority and control over the creative

    output, and that authority and control is completely automated.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many believe such a poem as the

    one I describe is radical because it seems to reflect the 20th

    century avant-garde tradition of process as a fundamental property

    of art. But again, process, algorithms, and the like were rather

    exotic intellectual ideas many years ago. Today algorithms and

    processes are as essential to control and surveillance as barbed

    wire and cameras, or perhaps even more so. In hindsight this

    comes as no surprise. We can completely predict the behavior

    of any algorithm and because they are so predictable they can

    be efficiently utilized for highly complex methods of control.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Objective Correlative

    of the Postmodern Aesthetics of Palimpsest &amp; Linkage: Use

    of The Hyperlink to Rest on More Links<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Contemporary hypertext

    poetics, perhaps the very culmination of radically disjoint poetics,

    is based almost entirely on the existence of the hyperlink. Users

    can find new ways of tumbling into some body of literature, perhaps

    never to escape! But we become ensnared, thus mirroring the industrial

    foundations of the Internet. As long as the linkages become the

    driving mechanism of poetic innovation, poetic innovation is

    not radical. It offers no resistance.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Radicalism in 2001, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E,

    and The Potentiality of the Internet<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Humans are being divided

    and conquered and separated and surveilled, and, ultimately,

    controlled by a remote minority. The remoteness itself seems

    to drive a certain amount of lack of regard for those being dominated

    in our culture, or it at least facilitates the lack of care and

    consideration for humanity that appears to be essential to authoritarianism.

    The mission of radicalism today, in 2001, is how to bring together

    people while confounding the mechanisms of authority.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language Poetry &amp; Disjunction

    &amp; Technology &amp; Ambiguity<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">During the Language poetry

    revolution, the powers that be were learning to use disjunction

    (in at least the structural sense of the word) for their own

    gain, particularly in the arena of electronic communications

    and surveillance. It appears we must turn to another way of keeping

    the resistance alive, even if it means doing something that might

    conflict with the radicalism of the past. Language poetry isn't

    dead. I am saying instead that when it comes to the Internet

    there are perhaps better ways to resist the machines and procedures

    that control us, that we are desensitized to daily, than hypertext.

    Perhaps in 1970 algorithms were an intellectual curiosity; today

    they are ubiquitous as essential elements of the authoritative

    control of our lives. Once upon a time procedural writing was

    of resistance, just as the solitary voice once formed resistance.

    Both algorithms and process no longer resist but instead support

    market and capitalist industrial power. Resistance must co-opt

    and then dumb down, make transparent, the powers of big brother.

    It must not reject the emptiness of signification but exploit

    it to its own end. Radical poetry must mock the use of such techniques

    in tongue-and-cheek ways to expose the ways power works and to

    scatter those very powers to the four winds. In a sense radicalism

    must take a form of Luddism trapped in a high-tech world; it

    must embrace paradox as if blessed contradiction were its own

    child. That is, it must indulge in technology that it aims to

    subvert. It might be the only way to get to people. But such

    resistance must obviate the occluded aims of power, must make

    the gestures of power obvious, or create works that show that

    there are ways to write that do not aim to control people, deliberately

    or otherwise. Such writings must not avoid contradiction at any

    cost; when the subtlety of conflict arising from contradiction

    is ignored, such a criticism cannot be avoided.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It appears that disjunction itself

    is perhaps no longer as radical as ambiguity. A gentleman always

    means what he says, right? Look at what gentlemen have wrought

    upon our world! A thief, however, never means what he says. I

    choose to not be so sure what I mean; ambiguity (androgyny is

    its analogue in the flesh) perhaps becomes more relevant than

    disjunction. After all, Big Brother is now selling disjunction

    at his own store and selling it as a means to watch you. I do

    not mean Language poetry sold out, not in the least; it means

    big brother has shifted his own form and co-opted disjoint structuralism

    as he has grown.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Word and image are surely different

    in important ways, but that difference no longer substantiates

    radicalism in poetry. The disjunction between word and image

    has not really been an important issue for many years; Western

    intellectual culture pretty much threw away the image theory

    of language years ago. After so many years of focusing on the

    differences, some poets are interested in recovering those tools,

    however futile it may be to treat any one thing directly with

    language. We can all accept there will be no such thing as a

    perfect analogy between a thing and any text, but after twenty

    years of being flooded by similarly imperfect attempts to replace

    such analogy with only intertextual linkages (the notion that

    text is analogous only to other text), we can now be assured

    that no sins are committed in <I>playing</I> with the relationships

    between word and image.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What does the web have to do

    with how word and image are connected? We feel they are somehow,

    yet we cannot nail such relationships down in words. But we also

    cannot avoid such a failure. Instead we can force unexpected

    and ambiguous connections that might appear empty but are in

    fact substantive through combinations of word and image in the

    most literal sense: some text and a graphic image. If an artist

    puts text and image together, they ARE connected, however arbitrary

    the connection is. It's that easy.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Technology of Text<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Text has always been

    removed from the user. It has always been somewhat more remote

    than spoken language (sounds like the web, doesn't it?). Text

    is a technology. It is a sometimes disjoint tool for attempting

    to represent speech. Text also provides language users with a

    storage device. Stone is the first hard drive. (Poetry is the

    precursor to this first static storage device, as poetic devices

    act as mnemonic tools.) Because of the disjoint nature of text,

    because of its apparent separation from the world, and because

    it is a &quot;lossy&quot; signal, the user seems always required

    to invent at least some part of the meaning of the text. That

    moment of invention is an act of creation. It's not just out-of-the-blue

    creation. I'm not saying anything as odd as that. The moments

    of creation that occur in a user's head are limited and predictable

    because the term has parameters of meaning. The parameters of

    meaning are the possibilities of meaning. Meanings can be parameterized

    in the text, by the text, and they can also be bounded by what

    the user has learned about the term.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As an example, imagine a text

    discussion of penguins. Now, what do people mean by &quot;penguin&quot;?

    Well, a reader may have gone into the reading with previous instructions

    about &quot;penguin.&quot; Antarctic black and white aquatic

    birds might be one of those parameters to &quot;penguin&quot;.

    Another might be LINUX, the well-known operating system, with

    its logo based upon the Antarctic bird. Or we might be talking

    about Batman's nemesis. And so on. The number of possibilities

    in a person's head parameterizes the possibilities for the term

    &quot;penguin.&quot; The term is parameterized in the text containing

    it as well. We might see the words &quot;Joker&quot; and &quot;Batmobile&quot;

    in the same context. The word &quot;penguin&quot; has been parameterized

    to Batman's nemesis, and this is in a way how a reader would

    normally create meaning. &quot;Penguin&quot; is really just a

    term like any other that has expectations set about its use in

    advance of encountering the term, and those expectations help

    move the reader towards some set of confines for the term's possibilities.

    Simply stated, the reader is somewhat limited to inventing the

    meaning by the limited set of choices made available by the text's

    context and the reader's own past experiences.<BR>

<BR>

    <B>The Disjoint Basis of The Military-Industrial Internet<BR>

    </B>The empty signifier and radical disjunction, in a sense,

    are fundamental properties of the Internet. The Internet born

    from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the central

    research and development arm of the US Department of Defense.

    DARPA is perhaps the very core of world military industrial domination.

    The very nature of the Internet is rooted in wide-area distribution

    effective for constant surveillance and rapid deployment of divide-and

    conquer strategies through distributed communications. The Internet's

    origins have lead to more commonly understood features of the

    Internet landscape: behavior monitoring leading to marketing

    strategies such as personalization, wide distribution of content

    for constant presence and the possibility of &quot;ensnaring&quot;

    the audience's attention (which generates more data for behavior

    control). All of this happens on an individual level to divide

    people into individuals with their custom web environments and

    conquer their wallets and their minds one at a time. The most

    crucial datum about modeling one individual's behavior is HOW

    THEY LINK. That is, how does one choice lead to another for each

    individual? How people make connections is perhaps the easiest

    aspect of a person's behavior that can be recorded using the

    Internet.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Text, Intertext Reference,

    and Hypertext<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Analogy seems impossible

    to be made intertextually. It also seems impossible to make an

    analogy between a thing and an image; Language poetry has succeeded

    in showing us how impossible of a mission it is. It might be

    made instead between text and a person. In a flash. Pow, it's

    perhaps magical, and perhaps that's what people are experiencing

    accidentally through using lots of hypertext. But with hypertext,

    resolution is impossible, and so all people see is the text-text

    relationships THAT ARE NOT REALLY THERE. It's all in the eye

    of the reader, or, rather, it's in the tripartite (1. user 2.

    text/technology 3. user/text connection) relation of text and

    person.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Radicalism and the Freeing

    of Language: Revealing Parameterization as Means to Control Language

    &amp; Minds<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The parameterization

    of meaning in the moment of the reader's invention of the meaning

    is what I call the control of language. (For now let's avoid

    the pejorative sense of &quot;control.&quot;) The parameters

    act as a sort of fence that restrict a reader's moment of creation/interpretation/understanding;

    the parameters give that creation a predictable shape. Controlling

    the parameters of language is transitively the control of language

    readers. Text can act to control people and people who control

    the parameters of text can control people. Depending on how a

    piece of writing is authored (number of possibilities &amp; ambiguities

    set up as intratextual cues for the meanings of terms) that text

    can strongly confine and dictate the meanings of the terms created

    by the reader. That is, a piece of writing can push the reader

    (and with his/her interpretations) into a well-defined space.

    Such writing is usually described as precise, clear, deliberate,

    etc. As an alternative, writing can pit parameter against parameter

    both intratextually and in the memories and expectations of the

    readers, allowing or forcing the reader to invent the meaning

    of such language in a completely unbridled way. Often this is

    what we refer to as poetry.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Let's think of parameterization

    in terms of the Internet and hyperlinks. A hyperlink, the specific

    form of Internet interactivity, is exactly a mode of parameterization.

    Quite literally. Hypertext linking is a mode of predefining and

    reducing the number of possibilities for meaning in a reader's

    mind. Such an effort, though they may help to guide users to

    make certain points, deliver instruction or knowledge, etc.,

    controls the set of creative cognitive possibilities. It also

    leaves the moment of creation in many cases (think of interactive

    poetries where a click &quot;generates&quot; or selects a preformed

    new phrase from a database of collected phrases, albeit by chance)

    almost completely to machines. The spirit is pushed out of the

    user and its ghost appears in the machine.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Poetry has rather consistently

    sought to find new reader inventions by both using language that

    is highly unparameterized and also by using forms that move people's

    thoughts away from the pre-established parameters either in the

    text or in the reader's memory. We know now that people with

    stutters can smooth out a stuttered word if they try to sing

    it; their loci of activity are moved away from the predefined

    and the expected, which has qualities that makes the person stutter,

    into the world of something less expected &amp; more beautiful.

    Likewise, early poetry is lyrical because an lyric is easy to

    remember, because of assonance and rhyme and alliteration as

    well as other lyrical techniques. When lyrical devices were no

    longer necessary for remembering poetry anymore. Poets began

    playing with meanings, moving words and phrases outside of the

    range of expectations and parameters. Poetry, perhaps since the

    advent of text, has functioned as a language of free subjective

    creativity and psychic freedom, breaking free from its previous

    function as a repository for cultural memories.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Text is understood in a complex

    where the user interacts with the text and invents a meaning.

    (What the real relationship is between text and image is not

    really my concern here.) What meanings are created are boundless

    but are bounded by previous expectation and intratextual cues.

    Hyperlinks are a form of a parameter, a form of a limit of the

    reader's creative moment, and transitively a tool of language

    control. Control of language necessarily implies control of language

    users. Poetry often works as an opposing force to the standard

    parameters, opening up the reader's ability to more freely select

    the meanings of terms and ideas, spawning previously unimagined

    associations and moving the reader toward uses of text other

    than as a device for control.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We might not want to ask if word

    and image are connected. Instead we might ask how people connect

    them, however arbitrary such connections are, and in what way

    can we write to make those connections unpredictable yet contrary

    to the aims of capital and military-industrial culture?</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Bandied Promises of Internet

    Radicalism in the 1990s<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many people once believed

    they could define the &quot;hot new medium.&quot; In the early

    to mid-1990s (and even today) many people did not understand

    that the medium was already well entrenched, and primarily a

    medium for the distribution of text and its surveillance. Much

    of it boiled down to plain old text and other pieces of data

    that are easily broken up into small pieces. For example, the

    physics community was already familiar with SGML and so HTML

    was very much the same thing, albeit easier. The World Wide Web

    (WWW) was born in the cradle of physicists. They used the Internet

    to distribute their papers and also watch and see who read what,

    actions very much in accordance with the potential of the Internet.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">During this time period, the

    literary community it seems was poorly informed as to the background

    and nature of the Internet. I believe that this is still painfully

    true of the literary community when it comes to the majority

    of poetic work I see on the Internet. Much of the literary community

    is not using those features that are most powerful but least

    likely to reflect the least radical aspects of our society.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The particular promises that

    the Internet would become some sort of egalitarian or liberalized

    utopia for literature were naive, and did not analyze the possibilities

    for expression in light of the potentiality of the Internet.

    The potentiality of a thing is crucial; the acorn becomes the

    tree, but not the squirrel; the potentiality of the acorn is

    the tree. The Internet never promised some sort of non-hierarchical

    literary experience, though it seemed for some odd reason to

    be the very central hope for such a possibility. Its birth in

    DARPA underscores what sort of potential the Internet has. As

    a medium the WWW specifically promised a quick way to share documents,

    images, etc., (emphasis on speed and wide distribution) and it

    offered a way to easily surveil not only the distributions of

    the documents but some aspects of their usage. The promises that

    the literary community believed as a whole was bound to mislead

    people, as there was only one rational basis for the belief that

    the Internet would provide something radical: the hyperlink.

    However, since the hyperlink was the very essence of the WWW,

    it promised only the rapid and wide distribution of information.

    As we speak, most literary works being created on the Internet

    seem to be aleatory practices, and most artists seem not to have

    much of a grasp of the implications of such work in a contemporary

    context such as those discussed earlier.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What is Radical in Poetry

    Today?<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What's radical about

    employing the gestic is that the gestic CANNOT be captured IN

    the language. The gestic can only be captured in the noise at

    best in text and around text. I can SHOUT in text but that's

    somewhat limited. One of the aims of the gestic is to move people

    towards living the local, the proximal. Problems arise when five

    or ten people make final decisions about the welfare of millions.

    Such a type of distal relationship creates an incredible amount

    of disregard for humanity, and is exactly the sort of social

    organization the Internet provides.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gesture &amp; Lyric<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A poet can be gestic

    and lyrical, but the gestic and the lyrical cannot be captured

    in plain old proper text. Being gestic and lyrical plays into

    the hands of the dominant paradigm; it mocks it and takes the

    power back. The weird side effect is that such an effort regards

    everyone.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Radicalism of Gesture<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Making people aware of

    gesture and radicalizing its role in power is essential to maintaining

    a radical stance. It is not a radical political notion to discuss

    the behavior of Henry Kissinger in slaughtering 10-15 million

    people across the globe as a gesture, describe them as actions

    taken by Kissinger so that he could establish &quot;credibility&quot;

    for the US (well, really for the Rockefeller patrons, for their

    banks and industries)? The bully flexes and threatens. Killing

    10-15 million for the gain of the American elite is but a gesture,

    a flex of power, one openly called by the powers that be &quot;establishing

    credibility.&quot; Establishing credibility is a mode of thuggery,

    of gangsterism, in any shape or form.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Radical Form is Radical Content<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The radical form of the

    current age seems to be radical content. Radical form has been

    co-opted by big brother and its name is the Internet. Myriad

    hypertext expressions of radical form confirm the legitimacy

    of oppressive forces. Proximate.org (http://proximate.org) maintains

    the tradition of radicalism by maintaining a place that responds

    to the current oppressive context. Language poetry in, say, 1975

    for example, was taking a radical stance in responding to the

    jingoism of mass media (among other things). One way it accomplished

    that was through disjunction.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">More on Text and Examples

    of Radical Poetry<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">But all of these ruses

    are still in part about text, or rather, text's shortcomings.

    Such limitations of text (and transitively, limitations of the

    Internet) challenge us to either try new ways of delivering gestural,

    extralinguistic information to readers/viewers or just to drop

    the use of text altogether. How do we get gestural extralinguistic

    information about text across to a viewer (a project that requires

    use of formal properties)? Can poetry be narrative, gestic, lyrical,

    AND radical?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Today a new radical body of work

    that moves radical poetics away from solipsism and the cult of

    the author is growing. Some examples include <I>Doubled Flowering</I>

    by Araki Yasusada, Barry MacSweeney's Pearl poems and his <I>Postcards

    from Hitler</I>, and Armand Schwerner's <I>The Tablets</I>. These

    works maintain hard-sought positions of ambiguity about authorship,

    loftiness, and poetry as the culmination of history. None of

    these works reject lyricism or coherence, yet the poems in each

    of these titles appear superficially different from one another.

    Despite the differences in the appearance of the poems, the poems

    seem to go together well for reasons other than formal consistency,

    while avoiding any sort of brand (authorial) identity. The style

    and odd authorial packaging bucks the potential for mass marketability.

    Importantly, each of these works are made of more than just radical

    form; each seems to have some sort of emotive propulsion, some

    emotional reason for being written, and they appear to favor

    a tinkering with narrative as opposed to its outright rejection.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Why Keep Language Poetry?<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Language poetry is of

    crucial importance in the resistance and articulation of resistance

    to central remote authoritarianism. Some of its means may no

    longer work to form a contemporary &quot;objet d'resistance&quot;

    but it is surely not to be rejected for some new fashion. But

    what a fine example Language poetry has provided! Language poetry

    provided a strong back to keep alive radicalism in poetry and

    in life, among many other things.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Internet Examples of Contemporary

    Radicalism<BR>

    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Heavy Industries <A 

    HREF="http://www.yhchang.com/">(http://www.yhchang.com/)</A>

    is a site that crisply illustrates that the web is at its best

    and most radical when being used as a means of enhancing speed

    of delivery combined with animated text, while not requiring

    or making the web out to be some privileged radicalizer of formal

    innovation. The site is minimal: the viewer is greeted with a

    plain text list of links, each connected to a serial text-based

    flash animation set to text. Its various flash animations makes

    excellent use of coordinating cadence, text, and sound, and seems

    to underscore an excellent use of the internet for the delivery

    of poetry. The site includes nothing that is flashy or dense

    or slow; it instead relies on a minimal design of black text

    timed to various jazz (mostly bop) pieces. The pieces in no way

    require the viewer to become intimate with them; the design asks

    the viewer for no personal attachments, the content is straightforwardly

    &amp; powerfully delivered.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Proximate.org (Proximate: prox

    I mate/me-ism/proxy-mate - machine as a lover) seems to be a

    site that has similar aims as Heavy Industries. The &quot;radical

    form&quot; on proximate in many ways is really a fake radicalism,

    since the code-stuff is extraneous, a joke on the viewer. (E.g.,

    <A HREF="http://proximate.org/01d3c0d3.htm">http://proximate.org/01d3c0d3.htm</A>).

    Proximate.org also treats a side-effect of the Internet: personalization

    and the way the Internet tries to suck a person in. With Proximate.org,

    the creator tried to illustrate the silliness of that side-effect

    as a consequence of language through the use of confrontational

    second-person language and also by shifting around the person-position

    of the viewer by changing the uses of personal pronouns. Proximate

    also tries to illustrate that there are more direct ways to &quot;get

    personal,&quot; hence all of the faces (a pun on interface).

    It seems the radical underpinning of proximate was to push people

    away from text and machines and towards more vital and proximal

    interfaces such as person-to-person interactions. As the site's

    slogan reads, &quot;Getting close is what we're all about!&quot;</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Proximate.org attempts to push

    notions of ambiguity of the self into the sociopolitical domain,

    and tried to show that such efforts to capture gesture on the

    Internet (like when people insist on using exclamation points!

    in writing to you over the Internet, yes only you!) can be manipulative,

    projective, a part of an ugly power struggle &amp; that those

    efforts at manipulation are what Language poetry was fighting

    against, namely, the ugly hegemony of the author-hero. And that

    push is absolutely dependent upon the notion that the self is

    central to the operation of a person's life. Many of these ideas

    have predecessors, like Vito Acconci and his confrontational

    art, or Ron Silliman and his forays into postauthorial writing

    (moving away from the &quot;chronic strategies of authorial domination&quot;,

    to borrow from Jed Rasula).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A wonderful parody of utopist

    visions of the Internet, called the &quot;cyborg manifesto&quot;

    is available on the web through an organization called adbusters

    at <A HREF="http://www.cyborgmanifesto.org/">http://www.cyborgmanifesto.org</A>.

    The parodic essay makes fun of the machine future that the Internet

    seems to tell us we absolutely must possess.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Poetry that articulates through

    gesture, ambiguity, emotive strength (no logic to an emotion),

    ambiguous authorship, without nebulous hypertext structure or

    use of algorithms, may be radical today. Poetry though can never

    become radical if it continues to maintain some sort of faith

    in any one answer to the question of self. It is when we answer

    and insist on our answers to ideas of the self that we continue

    to pursue either, in the case of Language poetry, a rather hasty

    rejection of self in writing (but perhaps not in authorship,

    and that's the difference between the action of writing and the

    thing we call a text,) or in the case of more &quot;mainstream&quot;

    (for lack of a better word) poetry, the insistence upon selves.

    The Internet helps gather power for a controlling minority by

    exploiting the self-centered possibilities of humans, and the

    rejection of that leaves us with answers that seem to be equally

    false. Perhaps the only answer to &quot;do selves exist?&quot;

    is, &quot;I do not know.&quot; As long as we maintain such a

    position on authorship, meaning itself is not owned, and the

    possibilities for poetry are wide open and fully resistant to

    centralized mass dominance and control.<BR>
