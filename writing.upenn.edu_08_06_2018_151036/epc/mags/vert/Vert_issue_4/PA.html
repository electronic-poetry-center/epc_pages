    to think about it (in the sense of setting the mood) before tackling
    the Quizzes below.]</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Is poetry ever distinct from architecture? Can it exist, in the
    most material sense, without it? Think of writing practices and
    their technologies: pens, paper, computers, printing presses,
    conferences, academic offices, the reading space, and so on.
    Again: Is poetry ever separate from architecture? One might protest:
    &quot;But architecture is a form of poetry, really.&quot; In
    which case, if true, it does not cancel the fact that there is
    an &quot;always/already&quot; interthreading and macro-historical
    conflation of practices. What do you think?</FONT></P>

    1) Can a poem have a blueprint?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The easy answer
    is: Every poem written can act as a blue print for every other
    poem. Even an easier answer would say, flatly, NO. But the spirit
    of the question begs for an affirming answer. I suggest that
    a poem can have a blue print &amp; that we could draw one. It
    may look something like this:</FONT></P>

    2) Does a door connect the &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yes, a door
    does. Just like in a house or an office. The major difference
    being that we feel claustrophobic upon entering the outside,
    and, just as importantly, bounding within the great indoors.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) What kind of door should it be: swinging or sliding?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It swings
    out, like a door to a French window, or those used in Western

    the porcelain abyss.</FONT></P>

    1) Is a dactyl a brick or a gargoyle? Justify.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With Dactyl
    we might build, either through math or through the structure
    of brick. Gargoyles might be said to hang off the structure like
    a dactyl. What is a dactyl?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) What is the relationship of engineering to poetic architecture?
    Is the architect-poet responsible for designing a structure that
    can actually be built? If so, why?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The relationship
    is conditional. There is no &quot;responsibility&quot; per se
    to actually build a designed structure. The two are separate
    until that time they are brought into relation. What is meant
    by the word &quot;built&quot;? Is Gaudi's Sagrada Familia &quot;built?&quot;
    If a building is drawn and not built, can we say that it does
    not stand? If they don't *function* as a building, but instead
    are only looked at, are they not to be said to be standing in
    relation to something that is not drawn, but exists as a conception?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) Can concepts of architectural acoustics (reflection, diffusion,
    diffraction of waves) be applied to poetry? Specifically, is
    the turn toward spatial rigor in concert hall structures by acoustical
    architects like Leo Baranek, Harold Marshall, and Michael Barron
    (the isolation of orthogonal parameters so as to fine tune sound
    reflection and reverberation via the control of initial time
    delay gaps) an argument of sorts for further (and urgent) investigations
    in strict prosodic structure, without which poetry is fated to
    continue its downward spiral into incomprehensible sonic and
    semantic muddle-- investigation, that is, not in the banal sense
    of traditional Western forms, but in the sense of Oulipean mathematical
    rigor. Whether yes or no, explain.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ambition
    is something that must be looked at. How can an author have such
    a word hanging around, any longer? To create semantic muddle
    is to challenge aspects of seriousness w/, ironically, a pretense
    toward seriousness. The word itself becomes neither itself, nor
    another's. What do we mean by muddle, where is the mathematical
    in the synthesis of things that could be said to be w/out muddle?
    How are we serious? Is this an argument between Mozart and Cage?
    Need we go to a restaurant and order a bottle of Bandol? Math
    eats my shorts.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    5) Are words in a poem a) rooms b) furniture c) walls d) vestibules
    e) windows f) corridors g) other? Explain.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I think of
    words as packages, that are discarded once they are opened up.
    In this manner we might say we throw away language. It is wasted
    on, and by, us. Language is in the service of servicing itself,
    is docile, is where I go to lie down and forget the act of meaning.
    Can I attempt to know these packages better? Can words be recycled?
    This is a question.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quiz #3</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) In poetry, what is an arch? Explain and draw a model.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    An arch is when you finally get back to what you were talking
    about originally, and having come to a point in the trajectory
    that, at last, you say what you had previously said. In this
    way we *experience* the transfiguration of attempting to step
    into the same river twice.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) Take Le Corbusier's somewhat forgotten Savoie house as analogy:
    Can the body of a poem be hollowed out in every direction: from
    above and below, from within and without, so that a cross section
    at any point will show inner and outer space penetrating each
    other inextricably? Think hard, keeping in mind that form in
    poetry has a long and unconscious history as a category &quot;apart,&quot;
    despite sporadic &quot;seminal&quot; announcements to the contrary.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yes, but
    then we need to discover a way to visit what is said and the
    words themselves in order to examine what we mean when we mean
    &quot;form.&quot; Can these words create, through their own condition,
    a dizzying example of their being at the point of not being.
    At this point we might confuse ourselfs for the poem. Furthermore,
    we might say that the *somewhat forgotten house* is indeed the
    only house we will ever remember.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) Is it possible, in a move of boldest conceptual elan, to build
    a poem over a waterfall? Confirm or deny, then, if the former,
    say what you would title such a poem. (Remembering that Wright's
    most famous building is a physically flawed structure, and that
    the roaring of the water forced the inhabitants to abandon the
    house.)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">No, waterfalls
    are guarded by little gnomes that demand riches no person can
    pay. Whomever paid for that house messed w/ forces larger than
    buildings, or the ego of their makers. What to call a poem built
    over a waterfall? This question, like many questions, seems far
    too open to answer, and requires a *move of the boldest conceptual
    elan.* To name this concept would be to perform a duty, or rite,
    toward its creation. I can only waiver over these falls.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    4) Is the incipient turn of new poetries to architectural/spatial
    theory symptomatic, in any way, of the generalized crisis of
    the current poetic avant-garde? Insert a compass as metaphor
    (or metonym, if you desire) in your answer.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The poetic
    avant-garde is itself an expression of its own crisis. A compass
    is used by girl / boy scouts on camping trips; this too is an
    expression of the generalized crisis w/ in the poetic avant-garde.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    **</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quiz #4</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) Take Michael Riffaterre's book Semiotics of Poetry, where
    he argues (as described by the American poet-bridge builder Henry
    Gould) that the poetic involves a dialectic between mimesis or
    representation, on the one hand (which creates what Riffaterre
    calls &quot;meaning&quot;), and significance, on the other. The
    &quot;architecture game&quot; of poetry, then, would seem to
    involve deciphering a &quot;significance&quot; that is always
    deferred by the parabolic indirections of transforming &quot;meaningful&quot;
    observation into architectonic structure. Does this suggest that
    a poem --the kind that is written on a two-dimensional page--
    is necessarily and merely a kind of deceptive *faciatta* through
    whose apertures an interior &quot;content&quot; is fleetingly
    and deceptively glimpsed against what is, in the most material
    sense, a swarming particle space? Answer yes or no via a parable
    in the style of Plato.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Yeah, well, you know there is this guy Socrates who like knows
    stuff, or really is totally skeptical about, like, everything.
    That is he thinks, like, I dunno... Wait.... That is, he doesn't
    think anything, about anything. He got into trouble doing things
    w/ young boys. But that wasn't it. He told a bunch of smug mugwumps
    that they didn't know anything, either. Which, well, pissed of
    all these dudes. Who then made Socrates drink some bad GHB or
    something. Bummer. Still, I think that parabolic indiscretions
    are bad. I mean, I looked faciatta up on the web, and like google
    didn't have anything, 'cept this page about some Italian castle.
    So, again, I dunno. Anyway, this kinda relates to Socrates, in
    that he was at his most meaningful or whatever, when letting
    others know how little was actually known. At this level, I think,
    we could almost say that a poem, that's what this is about, right?--okay,
    (deep breath), Where were we? Um. Yeah, that poems might mean
    their most directly in the moment of their greatest escape. In
    this way, the essence is said to have fled the battle at the
    moment of its victory. How, then, is this just like that odd
    experience of looking waywardly, or otherwise, into a mirror?
    That psychological shock of personal recognition, wherein we
    witness our own impossibility. Our own daunting content peering
    back into the blank and &quot;swarming particle space.&quot;</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) If a metaphor is a balcony, is the view it affords measurable
    in terms of a paraboloidal function (for example: x2/a2+y2/b2
    = 2cz [where a,b, and c are constants]), or is that just gibberish?
    Justify.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    The view it affords is that of mystery, since it can't afford
    the same view consistently, or across readings. In this manner
    we might say it eludes the act of seeing it. The metaphor is
    the balcony into which we see our own backyard.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) What is an Author? Is she an Architect? Think hard.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    She is, inasmuch as she stands in for all of us.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) Is the cultural &quot;space that forms the writing even as
    the writing (of experimental Authors, that is) attempts to probe
    its dimensions&quot; the space of a certain Flatland? Refer to
    Bachelard and the Japanese folktale about the mice and the elephant.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Does this
    *flatland* you refer to represent the Post-Modern &quot;flatness&quot;
    of expression / meaning? A kind of commercialized talk. If this
    is the case, then contemporary writing is, indeed, of the moment
    and inside its subject as a socially determined and flawed public
    space that realizes itself within the larger frame work of this
    social *flatness.* How then is this experimental?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) Can architectural acoustic theory (reflection, diffusion,
    refraction, decay of sound, and the artifices of its absorption)
    serve as an heuristic tool for imaging the institutional interpolations
    (not obvious ones like the Academy, but those at more inaudible
    frequencies) inhabiting the cultural structures of &quot;avant-garde&quot;
    poetry? If Yes, build a cardboard model of such a tool. If No,
    try to build one anyway.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">See me try.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) The following question is two questions, really, so points
    are double (tripled if the two answers are seamlessly melded
    into one): a) What is a &quot;flutter echo&quot;? Provide one
    example from the current English Poet Laureate and another from
    one of Jack Spicer's &quot;translations&quot; of Federico Garcia
    Lorca. b) Was Kurt Schwitter's Merzbau a visionary and mystical
    poetic text or a meaningless shrine to garbage, insanely imploding
    into an ever-more claustrophobic post modern space? Justify,
    being careful to note the possible irony in the question.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    The imploding flutter echo of the English Poet Laureate as written
    of by Lorca, translated by Spicer. Or is that written by Spicer
    and translated by Lorca?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    4) What is more relevant to avant-garde poetry's possible coextensiveness
    with architecture: The Brooklyn Bridge or the ruins of a university
    after a riot? Explain.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Up with ruins and riots! Bridges are fine, but today's avant-garde
    is, despite their stock portfolios, down w/ ruptures within the
    social being.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    **</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quiz #6</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) Is it possible that the recent desire amongst innovative writers
    to build analogic skywalks into a discipline of power and social
    utility such as architecture may be impelled from below by a
    hidden structure of ideological tensions and undergirdings that
    parasitizes and eats from within, thus shaping it as it consumes,
    the very social space of &quot;avant-garde&quot; aesthetic practice?
    Answer yes or no, and then rewrite this question into a syntax
    that is less onerous.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Writing can
    be seen as an illness when pressed up against utility &amp;/or
    power. Nonetheless, to build could be equated w/ writing. I can
    see how it might serve for while to think of these ideas in relation.
    Allen Ginsberg said _Howl_ was built like a brick shithouse.
    Talk about ultilty.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) As partly evidenced by the November, 2000 Language/Poetry/Performance
    Conference in New Dehli, contemporary innovative poets have become
    influenced by recent architectural theory's critique of &quot;Total
    Design&quot;, a concept that has two meanings: a) the &quot;implosive&quot;,
    in which design takes over all interior space (Sullivan, Wright,
    Taut, the Vienna Secession, etc.) and b) the &quot;explosive&quot;,
    where architecture is destined and authorized to move outward
    beyond discrete structure to encompass all scales (the Harvard
    School of Design via Gropius, the English Designs and Industries
    Association, etc.). The former resists (in petit-bourgeois/aristocratic
    fashion) industrialization and mass culture; the latter (in futuristic/avant
    fashion) seeks to become its very spirit. The former is most
    famously embodied by the Weimar School of the Arts and Crafts,
    under the leadership of van der Velde; the latter by the Bauhaus,
    under the inspiration of Gropius. Now, one could see the &quot;implosive
    school&quot; as analogous with the circumscribed ontology of
    mainstream, workshop verse, including recent conservative expressions
    of formalism: the Architect-Poet is the Hero of Interior Design.
    But one can also see, as Mark Wigley, head of Princeton's School
    of Architecture points out, that the &quot;explosive school&quot;
    is founded on an &quot;...explosion of the designer. Not only
    are objects designed, mass-produced, and disseminated; the designer
    himself or herself is designed as a product, to be manufactured
    and distributed. The Bauhaus produced designers and exported
    them around the world. The vast glass walls of the Dessau building
    which, in Gropius's words 'dematerialize' the line between inside
    and outside, suggest this immanent launching outward of both
    students and their designs. Even the teaching within the studio
    was a product. Gropius said that he only felt free to resign
    in 1928 because the success of the Bauhaus was finally established
    through the appointments of its graduates to teaching posts in
    foreign countries and through the adoption of its curriculum
    internationally.&quot; Write an answer of at least 300 words
    drawing parallels between the Bauhaus as described by Wigley
    and Language poetry, with particular attention to the latter's
    accelerating absorption by the academic institution. Be rigorous
    in your answer and avoid servile timidity.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hmmm... Does
    the product of language based poetics translate into solely an
    academic apparatus? Is this apparatus the only thing that can
    be made from Language based poetics? Are these structures creating
    what you call the *semantic muddle*? What about the semantic
    middle?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    As for the past (mainstream poetics) vs. a heralding of the future
    (avant-practice), it seems to also ring w/ the idea of an aristrocratic
    view of Art vs. what may loosely be called a Proletarite version.
    But, too, how do these visions conflict? Certainly there are
    aspects which underwrote the aristocratic approach that need
    not be repeated. But is this *muddle* you refer to the *muddle*
    of the middling classes in persuit of their desires? How is this
    to be redeemed, on both sides?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    Can the future be said to be Los Angeles, and the past Paris?
    Do such comparisons do more harm than good? If the future that
    we are building w/ this semantic muddle is a Los Angeles, how
    can we say that is a good thing? Should we write a Los Angeles
    poetics of No Return?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    How does this relate to teachers and MFA programs... and Bauhaus?
    Sure, we now have star avant-poet/teachers. Many of them in fact.
    It has become a thing to have on campus. Everyone *needs* one.</FONT></P>

    3) Is the Anglo-American Modernist long poem &quot;explosive&quot;
    or &quot;implosive&quot; in its architectures? Or is its largesse,
    rather, impelled by a dialectical tension between these two poles?
    If the latter, what does it mean that such a &quot;synthesis&quot;
    has resulted in the canonical ossification of the genre? And
    is this ossification analogous to the sacralization of those
    classical ruins to which millions of tourists every year make
    pilgrimage? Use The Cantos, The Wasteland, Patterson, Briggflatts,
    Cornish Heroic Song for Valda Trevlen, and The Anathemata as
    examples in your answer. This is a very complicated question,
    so don't leap to the obvious (i.e. &quot;Of course the Modernist
    long poem is 'explosive'!&quot;). You should think so hard that
    your very head catches fire.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The poetic
    architecture of such works seem to stand like monuments that
    neither implode nor explode. They reverberate, like a tree, or
    a wall. They contain a kind of fancy Winchester Mystery House
    attic feel-- in places you can run your hand over them. They
    tremble, between exploding or imploding desire(s).</FONT></P>

    4) &quot;The architects who talk about chaos, absence, fragmentation,
    and indeterminacy usually work hard to assure that you know that
    a design is theirs by using signature shapes and colors. Arguments
    about the impossibility of 'the total image' are employed in
    fact to produce precisely such an image-- a signed image that
    fosters brand loyalty. Clearly, the dream of the total work of
    art did not fade in modernism's wake. On the contrary, all of
    the issues raised by architects and theorists of recent generations
    that seem, at first, to signal the end of the idea of the total
    work of art turn out to be, on closer look, red herrings that
    thinly disguise the traditional totalizing ambitions of the architect.&quot;
    Relate this quote (5 extra points if you can identify its source)
    to Michael Palmer, Susan Howe, Jorie Graham, and J.H. Prynne.
    After doing so, briefly discuss the meaning of the Signature
    and its role as limen within Poetry's institutional architecture.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    My guesses are 1) Palmer, 2) Prynne, 3) Graham, 4) Howe. Yes,
    can we avoid not creating a new *in* language which is used to
    tell who is truly who? In this manner a space is provided to
    those who are *known.* At some level the operation on the author
    has created more loopholes than had, perhaps, previously existed?
    It is just a matter of refining the language. This happens in
    any clique that develops. Especially within an *out* group.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) Consider this thought experiment: You are a Poet, and although
    you cannot imagine it, you are always in a diorama. The diorama
    is inside a museum. The museum is located in a city. The city
    is in a 21st century country. The diorama changes according to
    the scheduling of exhibits: Savannah plains, Arctic ice, Rainforest
    verdure, Academic conference... Unaware of your placement, (for
    your reality has always been *here*) the limits of your Poetic
    world are obviously the limits of your diorama. Assuming this
    scenario, what is the spatial relationship of cutting-edge Theories
    of Space to your spatial predicament? Now close your eyes. Explain.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    I am a poet and I already live in a diorama w/ &quot;Theories
    of Space&quot; taped to my forehead. Perhaps you can tell me
    what they say?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) Please think of professional wrestling: Are the sounds the
    wrestlers make (the grunts and yells and body-against-canvass
    sounds) to the hoaxed fight as theory is to poetry? If so, is
    architectural theory, when quoted by poets, a kind of theatrical
    scream of &quot;pain&quot;? If not, why not? Think hard.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This may
    be a fair appraisal. The back is firmly on the mat.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) Let's assume that Western accentual-syllabic prosodies are
    a kind of white stucco wall: a paradigm of a will to order, a
    thin layer of periodically bumped plaster that hides the real
    materiality of the wall so as to produce a simulacrum of ideality
    and cleanliness uncontaminated by the foul fullness of history.
    The conceit drawn here is full of holes. Deconstruct it.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    I think you are stating that &quot;Western accentual-syllabic
    prosodies&quot; are *containing* or *giving order* or *reason*
    to a history that would otherwise confound and terrify. Sure,
    *progress* is also a part of this paradigm. Is artistic *progress*
    then also there to attempt to *justify* the &quot;foul fullness
    of history&quot;?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    4) Please consider Lenin. In 1920, in the midst of raging civil
    war, and shortly after a Social Revolutionary wounded him in
    an assassination attempt, he spoke before a Moscow conference
    of revolutionary architects, poets, and Constructivist artists,
    including Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, and Tatlin. &quot;It is dangerous,
    comrades,&quot; he said, &quot;to believe that Soviet art and
    architecture in the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat
    can outstrip the present and model the future.&quot; It is rumored
    that many of the petit-bourgeois intellectuals in the audience
    snickered at the ironic &quot;obviousness&quot; of such a remark.
    Mayakovsky, drunk, opened his trousers and produced his flacid
    penis, saying, with a dead-pan matter-of-factness, &quot;Look,
    it is a cloud.&quot; Christian Rakovsky, later to become a leader
    in Trotsky's Left Oppostion, laughed, and so did Brik and Mandelstam
    and Lunarcharsky (the latter who, in democratic spirit, had chosen
    to sit among the artists). Stalin, sitting across the aisle,
    two rows back, inhaled, blew smoke, and took note. It is said
    that Lenin was unusually lethargic and hesitant in this speech,
    perhaps due to his recent gun wounds. Taking the above scenario
    as starting point, make up a relevant question relating to Poetic
    Architecture, and then answer it.</FONT></P>

    In what fashion can we say that poetic opportunity exists to
    outstrip current history? Is it enough to be contemporary? What
    do more dizzying arrays of poetic archetiture mean? Are we only
    reifying the word, in a misbegotten service to late capitalism?
    Maybe so... It will depend on the twists of history to determine

    [This Quiz contains only one question. Therefore, your answer
    should be four times as long as usual.]</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) Derrida has said, in speaking of deconstructive architecture
    (Tschumi, Eiseman, Johnson, Steven Holl, COOP Himelblau, and
    others): &quot;First of all, they do not only destroy, they construct,
    effectively, and they construct by putting this architecture
    into a relation with other spaces of writing: cinematographic,
    narrative (the most sophisticated forms of literary narration),
    finally experimentations with formal combinations... all of this
    is something other than a restoration of architectural purity,
    even though it is also a thinking of architecture as such, that
    is, architecture not simply in the service of an extrinsic end.
    So, I am now increasingly tempted to consider this architectural
    experience to be the most impressive &quot;deconstructive&quot;
    audacity and effectivity. Also the most difficult because it
    is not enough to talk about this architecture; one has to negociate
    the writing in stone or metal with the hardest and most resistant
    political, cultural, or economic powers... It is these architects
    who come up against the resistances, which are the most solid
    ones in some way, of the culture, the philosophy, the politics
    in which we live.&quot; Doesn't this quote suggest to you that
    as soon as Derrida leaves the ethereal sky of Continental philosophy
    and enters into discussion about matters concerning everyday
    technology, that he comes across as a banal blabbermouth?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">He betrays
    us all, in that sense.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    In any case, consider, because he has a point: As long as innovative
    poets do not bring the imagination solidly up against the category
    of Authorship, that &quot;hardest and most resistant&quot; of
    ideological powers in the cultural field, will they ever succeed
    in constructing a truly new poetic architecture? Answer and speculate,
    in Piranesian fashion, what a revolutionary Archi-texture might
    be.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quiz #9</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    1) If architecture is merely sculpture that bodies can enter,
    then is poetry merely prose into which certain tunnelings and
    orifices have been chiseled? If this definition is valid, would
    you qualify it as an effective materialist definition of poetry?
    Write your answer in block letters.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    No, I think that it is not suffiecint to call chiseled prose
    the materialist definition of poetry. Poetry may be thought of
    as the poignant reach of the alienated masses toward a space
    of dignified agency. Unless, of course, otherwise...</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    2) Assuming that there is something to the above definiton, consider
    the following: Recent research into Egyptian pyramids has found
    that the famous and heretofore puzzling secret passageways that
    rise from the burial chambers toward openings at the outer walls
    are in fact precisely pointed (when the movement of the heavens
    through reversed time is factored into astronomical calculations)
    at key constellations, especially Orion. What seems clear is
    that these tunnels were intended as a sort of launching ramp
    through which to shoot the mummy-spirit to the stars. Without
    losing the materialist definiton we have set forth above, would
    you say that poetry has a like purpose, in any way? If not, would
    you say that there are particular objective historical forces
    (beginning with 17th century English copyright laws) that have
    progressively accreted to seal over the launch-openings with
    a kind of viscous substance? Reflect, please, avoiding vagueness.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I would say
    that poetry may have a like purpose, yes. But I have a problem
    w/ the heavens, as such. Perhaps this goes to the issue you're
    tempting me with? Perhaps it is this substitute value, namely
    fame, that today seals over, as you say, our appreciation of
    the desire to be so projected into the starry sky?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    3) If architectural theory has any utility for innovative poets
    today (careful: this is still an open question! [see, for example,
    Peter Riley's book, Architectural Analogies in Poetry: Comparing
    Apples and Oranges in Elysium]), then what happens when Steve
    McCaffery, for example, writes a poem under the influence of
    Vitruvius and Alberti, both of whom insist that the ordering
    and structure of their respective theoretical treatises perfectly
    match that which they prescribe for building (&quot;theory as
    art work&quot;)? Does the poem then take shape *around* the ideological
    Poet-space from which it is secreted, or does the poem instantiate
    itself as a kind of discrete space or chamber, like an hexagonal
    cell in a honeycomb, built by a bee who is, for all intents and
    purposes, blissfully blind to his Queen? Answer, please, in 300
    words, via the technique of Automatic Writing..</FONT></P>

    agents, &quot;Yellow is dirty.&quot; You are an insistent lamp.
    You are as vexed as a greyhound. Bred like bees are bred. Toward

    worshipful phase. See the vast uncollected space. See the villas
    and the vistas. See everything and leave. Do not step on the
    ladder. There are not enough of you. We sit together crying in
    the shape of a crown. There was nothing, nada, no body. In the
    space between we shouted-out words. There was nothing. We grew
    up shadowed. We threw up the shadow of light. In this we sat
    on the ground beneath the stars and thought nothing of it. The
    sound of October is nothing. I welcome all the three's and five's
    into my heart. The ground beneath your feet is for sale. The
    thing in between your toes is for no one, but you. There is this
    down side, to which the plants grow like light. There is the
    adjunct to the down side, to which the plants grow to like light.

    My Reasons For, My Love of Poetry</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    My Poetry is written for two main reasons, one is to express
    my feelings and the other is to tell a story. Expressing my feelings
    with poetry is probably the easiest way I can tell someone I
    love and care for them, also, at the same time I can relate within
    my poetry my innermost feelings of what matters most to me in
    life. Telling a story within my poetry is a unique way for me
    to tell a story of something homorous or dramatic that I have
    experienced in my life. My poetic antidotes of fictitious people,
    places, strange animals and creatures are mostly built on fact,
    (but I have of course stretched the truth a bit.) So for these
    reasons, I believe that, correct spelling, proper punctuation
    and good grammer is not necessarily a requirement for the writing
    of humorous, light hearted or serious poetry.<BR>

    1) Go back to Quiz #6 and review the outline given there of Total
    Design as insistent concern in 20th century architecture, in
    both its implosive and explosive traditions. Now consider the
    following dictum/ars poetica of Barrett Watten, an experimental
    poet and theorist who has been as interested in issues of architecture
    and social space as any American poet since the Vietnam war:
    that poetry is, in its essence, the manifestation of &quot;a
    mind in control of its language.&quot; What is the relationship

    published in a magazine like Jacket (if, indeed, he gets around
    to sending his work there)? In other words, think of Jacket as
    a sort of Bauhaus house. Would having O'Brien's decidedly naif
    &quot;Red Rose&quot; poem there mess up the interior design?
    Would its appearance there embarrass the guests at the cocktail
    party, like, what... say a velvet portrait of Elvis next to the
    Julian Schnabels and Sally Manns? This question is about axiology
    and the way its messy wiring is cosmeticized by facadical architectures
    and floor plans. In other words, would O'Brien be rejected because
    his poem is &quot;ugly,&quot; or would he be rejected because
    the poem doesn't &quot;fit&quot; into the Total Design (a concept
    whose ideological vectors remain virtually uninvestigated within
    the institution of &quot;avant-garde&quot; poetry)? This is a
    very important question. Answer it at length.</FONT></P>

    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I think the
    obvious case of pathologic need arising out of Mr. John O' Brien's
    work will keep him out of nearly all literary magazines, (save
    this one). And yes, it is a cocktail party--that is healthy to
    remember. I think O'Brien's display of affection, while unquestioned,
    remains, for him, obviously, a source of continuing disturbance.
    Which maybe points to something altogether interesting: How does
    hackneyed and earnest expressions of entrenched gender / romantic
    mores coupled w/ hackneyed and entrenched poetic devices become
    an instance of self-questioning in the the desire for a new poetic
    future? What remains in O'Brien's work that we *feel* may have
    been lost? Is there a thing within what this work represents
    that we sense is missing? How does this question link up to Jean-Luc
    Goddard's movie, &quot;Alphaville?&quot;</FONT></P>

    4) How high can a poem be built? Can it have elevators? Can the
    cable on the elevator in a high-rise poem snap so that the elevator
    drops for hours, crashes through the ground floor, and keeps
    going all the way down to Hell? What do you think the architecture
    is like in Hell?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    The architecture in hell? I think there are many examples, in
    many cities, across this land mass we call home.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quiz #11</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
    This final quiz contains only one long question. Your answer
    will need to be at least equally as long... It would be easy
    to rewrite each of the &quot;architectural&quot; interpolations
    in the quote below to describe the current ideological Other
    of the poetic field. (In fact, we will place &quot;poetry&quot;
    in parentheses, in nominal or adjective form, where appropriate.)<BR>
    So: Is such social/economic magma poetry's repressed but elemental
    ground? If not, why not? What would be needed to move beyond
    its big suck so as to loose poetic production into a truly autonomous
    and liberatory field? Here is the quote. Five extra points if
    you can identify its source: &quot;The institution of architecture
    [poetry] is clearly more than buildings [poems] and the practices
    by which they are produced... The building [poem] &quot;itself&quot;
    is no more than a specific mechanism of representation. In fact,
    there is no such thing as a building [poem] outside of a large
    number of overlapping mechanisms of representation: schools of
    architecture [poetry], professional codes of ethics, critical
    practices, historiographical methodologies, academic protocols,
    pedagogical techniques, curriculum structures, the strategic
    role of the author's signature and project credits, legalization
    of the word &quot;architect&quot; [&quot;poet&quot;], designated
    safety factors in structural [prosodic] calculations, standardized
    drawing [writing] techniques and conventions, building [attributional
    undergirding] codes, aesthetic codes, zoning codes, clothing
    codes, school admission standards, faculty classifications, fee
    structures, hiring and firing practices, rhetorical conventions,
    examination structures, model-making techniques, various forms
    of etiquette, legal contracts, copyright law, the structure of
    the slide lecture, strategic control and dissemination of ideas
    through conferences and publications, ritualized master worship,
    theoretical and graphic commonplaces, copy-editing protocols,
    interview and presentation formats, photographic techniques,
    the institution of the architectural [poetry contest] jury, portfolio
    construction and circulation rituals, competition formats, official
    and unofficial club membership control. Funding patterns, the
    structure of the architectural [poetic] monograph, the biography
    and so on, to name only some of the most obvious ones. All of
    them are mechanical systems of reproduction whose ritualistic,
    if not fetishistic, repetition constantly affirms the presence
    of architecture [poetry] rather than analyzes it. Indeed, the
    very intensity of their repetition seems to mark a nagging but
    suppressed doubt about that presence. They are the real mechanics
    of architecture [poetry]. The building [poem] is literally constructed
    by these mechanisms of representation.&quot;</FONT></P>
