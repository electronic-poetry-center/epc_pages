    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Skipping, Mrs. Freedman says,
    is simple, easier <BR>
    than learning how to walk. She pulls my colt legs <BR>
    out of class to show me so we start in a circle, but end <BR>
    up in a line like ants I think like the word from our history
    lesson: <BR>
    Industrial is how we do it in the assembly line the grocery <BR>
    line the strike of teachers before the frost the cool way <BR>
    De Niro walked in that movie where he moved like a crab <BR>
    but not really with claws more with that speed. I think <BR>
    it was a mob and he was alone.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To be the one who can't do, whose
    body fidgets <BR>
    in disbelief among competitors I'm an accidental rebel <BR>
    thanks to my uncoordination I refuse to move like they <BR>
    do or swim perfect patterns at the public pool at noon where<BR>
    I'd rather burn my feet where the water didn't lick<BR>
    the concrete walk instead I'm dared to stand<BR>
    on the bouncy board the one way up here where my toes <BR>
    curl like barnacles around the edge where someone <BR>
    orders me to dive. A horsefly green on my nose.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'd rather take the escalator,
    or gallop really fast away <BR>
    from this clot of old sweat and shorts, away from the cult<BR>
    of boys huffing behind me but my feet are stupid<BR>
    refusing to move, like velcroed cinder blocks, because<BR>
    I was slow too in learning how to tie two laces to make<BR>
    a butterfly bow. This fear of the motionless is the fear <BR>
    of momentum, the devastation of competence in the face <BR>
    of a question. Mind full of cul-de-sacs I have <BR>
    a secret to tell before we try this again. Sister swear <BR>
    not to tell the others I'm still scared to go beyond the mailbox
<BR>
    to touch the street even myself.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Somewhere else is the music class
    with Mrs. Saks <BR>
    singing patriotic songs in her slippery voice that makes <BR>
    us red and looking at each other when she reaches up<BR>
    into that high note and holds it too long so nothing<BR>
    hides not even lip-prints on the water fountain spigot<BR>
    the puddle of piss on the hardwood chair or the trigger <BR>
    that boy makes with his fingers beneath<BR>
    the desk the dirt beneath his nails and he's the one<BR>
    a girl next to me whispers who took pictures of my down-<BR>
    there after I fell off my bike and knocked my head<BR>
    on the sidewalk got knocked out and he has Polaroids<BR>
    to prove it.<BR>
<BR>
    What did I want to be told that here you sit<BR>
    with your linear shoulders with your hieratic head<BR>
    and there you'll go to relieve yourself of<BR>
    yourself and nowhere but in there where sneakers<BR>
    squeak on waxed floor do you move how<BR>
    colonies spread with large steps lots of demolition<BR>
    and boys first because they could always run<BR>
    faster anyway and it wouldn't be moral to put you<BR>
    in the same bathrooms. But I have these brush-burns<BR>
    on my forearms I want to say where hairs turned<BR>
    darker slicked with blood and I walk home<BR>
    with my sleeves rolled up because I am so what</FONT></P>
