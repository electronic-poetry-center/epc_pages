    what an issue it is! Go see Cora Lee Potter's work, it is her
    first time in print, er, virtual print. And to think she is in
    w/ the likes of John Ashbery. There are six poems from Eleni
    Sikelianos' book <I>Earliest Worlds</I>. Plus a review written
    by Jono Schneider. An essay by Patrick Herron about the Internet's
    relation to the *radicalization* of poetry. And Kent Johnson
    gives me eleven quizzes to answer-- see how I avoid answering
    each question. There are excellent, engrossing, lyrical poems
    from Candance Moore, Ken Tanemura, Elisabeth Workman, David Hadbawnik,
    Aaron Belz, Richard Carfagna, Bill Freind, Samantha Giles, Andrew
    Goldfarb, Patrick Herron, Andrew Felsinger, Jeffrey Jullich,
