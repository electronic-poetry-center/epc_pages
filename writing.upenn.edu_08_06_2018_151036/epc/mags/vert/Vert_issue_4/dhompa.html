      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Politeness prohibits saying what
      I really think. <BR>
      Viaduct: a code for a feeling. Like mauve,<BR>
      over the street of tarmac: a grave summer day<BR>
      offering clean streets and a leg longer by perspiration.<BR>
      Or gannets in sight. That women are said to speak so much <BR>
      of feelings; as though to clarify would mean its end. <BR>
      It never is. Clarification I mean. To indicate trust I tell you
<BR>
      the fish is who I look at most these days. For love, for love.
<BR>
      Endings happen. Words I use because I like who I become. <BR>
      Summer resolved of mysteries. Give me nothing. Tiny, tiny<BR>
      pebbles used as prop. Tilted and tinted glasses. City<BR>
      of my desires has lines rigged at the waist. One minute<BR>
      of sleep at a desk might bring it all down. Words you find <BR>
      under my nail. (S)wallow. Some night owl effusion.<BR>
