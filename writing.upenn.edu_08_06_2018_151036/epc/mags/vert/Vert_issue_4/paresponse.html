        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Kent Johnson and Andrew
        Felsinger,</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
        Poetry is not an architecture, but you can claim it as a symptom
        if you like. Poetry as architecture is not a new theme, nor is
        it particularly enticing today in a world where architecture
        claims a unanimous poetic vision. I can't think of any current
        architect who does not claim some poetic insight into their work.
        Put down that pen and build something and show us what a real
        poet you are. Poetry can certainly be effectively extended into
        architecture, this I do not dispute, but it's &quot;archi-texture&quot;
        as you mention is an extension that must be critiqued if it is
        to be embraced.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
        Poetry is in fact the opposite of architecture, as poetry is
        fundamentally destabilizing, disorganizing, collapsing. Poetry
        dislocates its object and interrogates it with the bright light
        of the imaginary. But architecture, whether it claim instability
        (deconstruction) or not, always crosses the threshold into the
        real if it is not simply to remain a poem (and thus &quot;incomplete&quot;
        as architecture). So no, the &quot;realization&quot; of the poem
        is not an architecture. It *comes before architecture*. And that
        is why it provides us with a way out of the architectural metaphor,
        which opens as much doors as it closes. That is why poetry, by
        dislocating its object, actually formulates in effect a &quot;counter-object,&quot;
        an imaginary object that does not remain merely subjective (for
        it is composed, written or spoken - that is, named). Poetry is
        not simple dislocation which is at the same time relocation (deconstruction),
        but it takes the &quot;object&quot; of dislocation itself, transposing
        this object out of its very dislocation. Or, if you will, it
        is an *object without objectivity*.</FONT></P>

        So then poetry is not merely abstraction, abstraction from architecture,
        abstraction from self, abstraction from nature, abstraction from
        language. Poetry must be concrete, but not necessarily a form
        of concretization (that itself defines architecture). I am a
        big fan of architectural theory, but I have yet to see any major
        use of poetry in architecture that has made me rethink poetry
        (although it has made me rethink architecture). I take for example
        Bernard Tschumi's quote describing his architectural perspective
        as &quot;Not the conditions of language but the language of conditions&quot;
        to be a good example of the distinction between poetry and architecture.
        Architecture takes the poetic object and turns it into a question
        of conditions. Poetry, to be effective, dwells in both conditions;
        or, if you will, the *conditionality* of conditions. Poetry uses
        architecture but only on its own terms, that is, such architecture
        already arrives displaced within the poem. The best poetry does
        not mourn this displacement or claim triumph because of it, rather
        it takes it as a starting point to both interrogate this condition
        and radicalize it. For *architecture is fundamentally bound to
        realization, while poetry is fundamentally bound to radicalization*.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
        But what then is the architecture of the question mark? The architecture
        of this: ? - the angle itself, the curve and flow, the opening
        of a circumference itself that leads to an opening of the word.
        At least, if you will, it is more a question of poetry than is
        the architecture of an examination.</FONT></P>
