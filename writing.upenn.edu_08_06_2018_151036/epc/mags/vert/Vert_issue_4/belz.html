        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd's canoe is full of plaster,<BR>
        plasticine, and alabaster.<BR>
        It has one big seat labeled MASTER<BR>
        and a small one labeled SERVANT.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd's canoe is nice and wide<BR>
        like the rivers down which it occasionally<BR>
        glides. It has faux-birch on the outside<BR>
        and plush purple velvet on the inside.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd's canoe holds many riches<BR>
        and has been seen transporting pretty bitches<BR>
        who do nothing but throw coins at fishes<BR>
        and giggle, whispering their wishes.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd's canoe is nothing to sneer
        at.<BR>
        It's nothing for another canoe to carelessly veer at.<BR>
        It's an important vessel that hard-working oarsmen<BR>
        gaze at jealously, for they have learned to fear it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd's canoe goes really fast.<BR>
        It's just a canoe, it has no mast.<BR>
        It's not a play, it has no cast.<BR>
        It's just a really fast canoe.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Todd defied the advice of his
        pastor<BR>
        and tricked out a big canoe, of which Todd alone<BR>
        is MASTER: a spiritual disaster.<BR>
        He may as well serve Zoroaster.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What will he build with all that
        plaster?</FONT></P>
