      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Unlike our relatives in Tokyo,<BR>
      we have never visited neighborhood shrines.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Never bought candles and incense
      sticks<BR>
      for family altars.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Never placed pine and bamboo<BR>
      on each side of our house entrance<BR>
      to keep evil spirits away.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Never hung rice-straw ropes<BR>
      and fern above the door, tucked with an orange,<BR>
      a persimmon, a paper lobster and seaweed<BR>
      to secure health and love.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We have never cooked meals 3
      days<BR>
      before January 1.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Never gathered before midnight<BR>
      to listen for the temple bells<BR>
      and stand quietly in the dark.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I don't believe the rain or that<BR>
      the street is wet or the sound<BR>
      dripping from the patio and<BR>
      onto the huge leaves of the<BR>
      rhododendron, is a result <BR>
      of the weather. I don't believe<BR>
      it's winter or that spring is<BR>
      around the corner or<BR>
      the sky is grey. I don't believe<BR>
      only a few birds sing or the lawn<BR>
      is soaked or the dirt slushed to mud.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I believe the sky is the deep
      blue<BR>
      of renaissance oil paintings,<BR>
      that there's a clear field outside<BR>
      where Ono no Komachi<BR>
      sits, open book in lap,<BR>
      closing her eyes. <BR>
      I believe that over the fences<BR>
      there are pastures almost dry<BR>
      from the sun, and dirt roads baked<BR>
      light as sand, bearing no footsteps.</FONT></P>
