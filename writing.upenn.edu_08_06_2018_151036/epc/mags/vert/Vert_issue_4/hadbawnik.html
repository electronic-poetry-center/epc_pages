      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Today I stole a book. The clerks
      were turned<BR>
      away, I dropped it in my pocket, slipped<BR>
      out the door, alarms inside my head burned<BR>
      but didn't sound, although I nearly flipped</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">when later, leaving Cala's with
      a pack<BR>
      of tortillas shoved under my arm<BR>
      the manager carefully eyed my sack<BR>
      but made no move to signal the gendarme.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I stole nothing this evening,
      but a glance<BR>
      at the woman on the street who whispered<BR>
      as we stood outside that she liked my pants<BR>
      &amp; since she smiled, I also took her word.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then I came home, and quietly
      reflected<BR>
      on the book, the food, the look that I'd collected.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ask yourself why you think I
      was a jerk<BR>
      when I loved you all those years the only<BR>
      way I knew how, desperate &amp; lurking<BR>
      in the shadows sometimes, sometimes lonely</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">perhaps not the lover you had
      in mind<BR>
      but that's the way it goes, baby doll, I<BR>
      can't explain away all those unkind<BR>
      gestures when I tried to mollify</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">your impatience with my unloverly
      style<BR>
      my wicked denials &shy; remember that time<BR>
      I drove the Mercury backwards for a mile<BR>
      &amp; Sonny had to push me out, the dimes</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">spraying from my pocket on the
      pavement<BR>
      O God, it wasn't how I wanted them spent.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I've never questioned your love
      for me.<BR>
      It's just there like socks or spare change<BR>
      for the woman on 24th St. who's always<BR>
      asking in that pitiful voice, please I need</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">to buy some white shoes for my
      job<BR>
      she says or please I need a place to stay.<BR>
      There's no shame in that. Or the rose petals<BR>
      that quietly depend on it, stuck as they are</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">in clay pots out front of the
      florist<BR>
      their red dye running on the sidewalk<BR>
      on Sundays like tears on a lapel like<BR>
      anything. I've never questioned your love</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">even when I reach into my back
      pocket<BR>

      to change us.&quot;<BR>
      What Dale Smith wrote of Cabeza de Vaca<BR>
      coming back to haunt me throughout the day<BR>
      leading me into my own dark spaces,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">fog skimming off the windows
      on gusts<BR>
      of wind, restless at night I go for a drive<BR>
      down busy Mission streets cut by Joe's Diner<BR>
      neons, past Excelsior where I know</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Diane lives, thinking of her
      new book<BR>
      &amp; then remembering Chris McCandless who<BR>
      died of the wilderness he sought out<BR>
      starved in a shack in Alaska. And I</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The pigeon on the roof next door<BR>
      stared at me for an hour. I was<BR>
      watching TV my hand down my pants<BR>
      for no reason, wondering what it was like</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">to be a pigeon voyeur. I didn't
<BR>
      get up. The pigeon moved<BR>
      eventually &amp; I heard it cooing<BR>
      somewhere. It was like overhearing an argument</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">that began in a coffeeshop ten
      years ago<BR>
      between two lovers who don't<BR>
      love each other anymore but can't<BR>
      bear to break up. I took my hand</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">out of my pants.<BR>
      I changed the channel.</FONT></P>
