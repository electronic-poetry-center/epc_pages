          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We refused to take anything
          removed and distanced from the context within which it arose
          during our conversation as self-evident or obvious. As far as
          we were concerned, our approximation of truth should resist being
          tacked into place by the tricky syllogisms of a logical system.
          For us, truth dwelt in the paradoxical and seemingly inconsistent,
          in the friction of antinomy. Our discourse largely adhered to
          a circular rather than a linear flow. However, despite our circumlocution,
          our energy, in opposition to certain laws postulated by Newtonian
          physics, was not perpetually recycled. Rather, the meaningful
          play of our conversation constantly jettisoned the irrelevant
          and uninteresting. So that we might be able to suddenly branch
          off into more provocative avenues of discussion, we made use
          of escape hatches and fire escapes. Hence our conversation would
          molt to reveal surfaces inspired by the tangential and capricious,
          by the stream of consciousness. In short, we sometimes set the
          player on random. Above all, what we shared momentarily lightened
          the oppressive weight of our existence.</FONT></P>
