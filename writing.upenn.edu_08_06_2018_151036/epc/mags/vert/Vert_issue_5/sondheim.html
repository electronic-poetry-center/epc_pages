          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The fit of buckles perturbs
          me, how do you say, the waist hits here, does the leg evolve.
          She's wiggling near a desk, an indent, flicker and fidget, it
          is always small words in a conversation that convey the most,
          it is always how she forms things. <I>I guess</I> she fathoms
          -- in my mind she brushes her bangs from her eyes and lifts them,
          when the glasses fall away it's only wanting that remains. <BR>
<BR>
          I want to be that for that &shy; unscathed in the beginning,
          when you watch someone they move the way they should, at that
          point intentional seaways, determined. In moments I think of
          the intertwining. What it would be like without my body involved
          &shy; how can I love, intimate, I verse her with someone else.
          In one scenario, under leaves, near a parking lot. Living mineral,
          she scrapes ice off another's back, I'm watching as I fall asleep.
          Detailed I imagine her preferred, supine, caressing labels, guitar
          strings, twisting familiar hair around and yanking. Chipping
          at splinters the way her fingers might move.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What without fits, grumpiness,
          sick fumbling. Interest lies in study, unearthed the lady manages
          boneless with both arms intact. I stampede, watch for implosions.
          Remember that initially mutuality vibrates. The tincture, eventually
          exhausted, imparting metal scraps, fitting whispers. I sustain,
          reject, exhale &shy; not too much in odor, slight demarcation
          &shy; nothing new. <BR>
<BR>
          Outside of this there's the spit of stories. Meaning, I've replaced
          parts, engaged in disarray, untruth. <I>Don't entirely</I> -
          last week, I pushed my head into her arm, reluctant to step away.
          Nonplused I seal their arms together &shy; indulge smoky dancing,
          the pursuit of slinky. I believe in the sentiment's absence so
          I believe in the sentiment itself. Only one away and I'm well
          &shy; disarm few conversations, grace a table. Irrelevant when
          another is running scattered, drip-dressed and perchance, scribbled
          translucent.<BR>
