          <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">by Andrew Felsinger</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I published the following poem

          in Issue #4 of -VeRT Magazine as having been written by John

          Ashbery :</FONT></P>

          <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Meatball Curtain&quot;</FONT></B></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Literally, they say, &quot;choked.&quot;<BR>

          But pissing into the snow loosens nothing up.<BR>

          I mean I; the reason why this remoteness <BR>

          Haloes the how the day went,<BR>

          Mathematical probability of the<BR>

          Sound attached to the Seine's hypotenuse of ice<BR>

          And the grafittoed monuments <BR>

          Experienced as examined pulses, signals <BR>

          To be precipitated in desire<BR>

          The way a name gets spelled out magically<BR>

          In blotto green light the sleet sparkles across.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But must admit I don't know

          for sure who wrote the poem. Is Jacques Debrot the author? He

          has similarly written both sides of an interview with John Ashbery,

          published by 2nd Story Books.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I knew the poem could be of

          dubious authorship, but chose to publish the work nonetheless.

          It contains a clumsy elegance that I also recognize and enjoy

          in Ashbery's work. I like to think of &quot;Meatball Curtain&quot;

          as something that perhaps Ashbery could have jotted down, a minor

          yet worthy work allowed to slip from his desk, a poem pinned

          to his corpus, an homage to the intricacies (mysteries) of identity

          and art.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But a poet researched the work

          and was offended by this coloring outside the lines. The work

          has been subject to a lather of <A HREF="http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html">Listronics</A>

          (See August/September) as well as threats of a lawsuit. There

          have also been claims that &quot;Meatball Curtain&quot; somehow

          hurts or annoys John Ashbery himself! I have been, therefore,

          asked to remove John Ashbery's name from &quot;Meatball Curtain&quot;

          and make this retraction.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I was struck by such information.

          In an earlier and &quot;legitimate&quot; interview in <A HREF="http://jacketmagazine.com/02/jaiv1988.html">Jacket

          Magazine</A> Ashbery professes his admiration for literary frauds.

          What is more, Ashbery's work often displays a sort sliding /

          unidentifiable personal pronoun, (the very opposite of &quot;I

          mean I&quot;?) in which it is perhaps understandable to imagine

          this next step, of abstracted authorship, as inevitable.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What is more, John Ashbery is

          not known to use computers. How would he know of this little,

          new, West Coast, poetry web 'zine? It seems far afield. I can

          not seriously imagine John Ashbery pensively reading &quot;Meatball

          Curtain&quot; and wondering over its supposed prescient and nefarious

          contents.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">One possible explanation may

          be that such work requires scandal? Note the following email

          :</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">Dear Jacques,</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">You interviewed me, and

          I showed you around the apartment, even letting you browse the

          rarest, most limited-edition books. And then you changed certain

          things I said. I left it well enough alone, even against my deeper

          instincts. But please don't take the confidence too far. I understand

          from Andrew Felsinger of VeRT magazine, that you intend to publish

          there a poem I sent you three years ago, specifically designated

          for your now-defunct magazine. I would remind you of copyright

          conventions, in case you have forgotten (or didn't know about

          them?). Let me tell you that when Frank was laid out, the long

          suture lines along his joints were like mountain ranges. &quot;What

          about our vacation in Kabul?&quot; he breathed, a hundred martinis

          on his breath. &quot;Go back to sleep,&quot; I wept.And anyway,

          the poem was written by Joseph Ceravolo before he died. Plus,

          I don't appreciate being made a part of some obscene charade

          about Jacques Lacan, especially when the matter has insulted

          people in England with whom I have close relationships, like

          Peter Riley and Lawrence Upton. I'm sending this through Kent

          Johnson, whoever he is, since I am not subscribed to Listbot,

          even though I know who Jordan Davis is, of course, through Kenneth.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS">John</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS"><BR>

          </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The email is the work, obviously,

          of Kent Johnson. It was posted to the <A HREF="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-poets.html">British-Poets

          Listserve</A> in order, I surmise, to stir up interest in &quot;Meatball

          Curtain,&quot; which at the time was about to be published in

          Issue #4 of -VeRT Magazine.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The

          email is interesting in a number of ways: It states that the

          poem was &quot;written by Joseph Ceravolo before he died.&quot;

          And there is this reference to &quot;Frank&quot;? Well, as interesting

          as this may be, I don't have the inclination to follow up these

          leads, if that is what they are? I am not as interested in the

          poem's creation as I am in the authorless fiction that allows

          for this semi-stateless object to float in an Ashberian ether.

          In a kind of no-zone.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">To expose this poem as a fraud

          is, perhaps, part of *the plan*? To, somehow, square this circle.

          If so, then, I've done this, my part.</FONT></P>
