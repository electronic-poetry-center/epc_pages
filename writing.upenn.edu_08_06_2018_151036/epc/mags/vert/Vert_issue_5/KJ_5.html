        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Mr. David [Bromige]:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It is to our delightful attention
        that the poetry of Sudan is now discussed in the poetry of America
        with such suddenness. Thank you for being a section of this and
        for making a vision of a poet of Sudan. In ways I believe you
        do not suspect, you have entered the Arab nation's literature.
        It is my principle, nevertheless, that you must be delighted
        by this.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Please excuse my English, but
        I am writing to invite you, as a poet first of Canada and now,
        secondarily, of America, to what I now wish to present. I am
        speaking concerning a conference (International) devotional to
        translation in all the sense of this word. We are interested,
        with specificness, in the doubled (tripled!) voices passed through
        many mediators of history and cultural ignorance. Irony, as I
        feel you must conceptualize, is big here. Irony, in its bigness,
        becomes something other. It is like, for an example, you, a Sudanese
        poet speaking through an English tongue of brokenness. Or it
        is like many, many things: For an example, if I may twice say
        so: It is like two boys kissing in the shadows of a pharmaceutical
        plant. (They are like black and deep wells. Their lives inside
        are very, very rich.) The sun will come up over this dusty land
        and an ancient hatredness shall fill them.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I do not know if I put myself
        well. So may I directly ask. Will you come to Khartoum? Please
        close your heavy eyes and dream of my branching hand opened out
        to you.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We passion to invite another
        poet of America, Mr. Kent, who also is credenced in your two
        countries, and perhaps others, to be a racist. (In his reply
        to our Central Council, he spoke: &quot;I am honestly not sure.&quot;)
        Still we are opened, and we have most little, but our flowing
        tents which appear (to all purposes and meanings) to be sailboats
        in the desert, are yours. Our young are fresh and eager, and
        they shall press into your soft mouth goat cheese with a hurt
        and surprised look in their eyes. Also, dark-skinned soldiers
        with golden and musical watches adorn every minareted corner.
        Yes, you will find Khartoum strange and hospitality-filled, except,
        as you realize, inside certain surprising circumstances. But
        lightning on a human is more likely, so really not to worry.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Ethnography, of course, is also
        interesting to every one of us and to all peoples. Our flowing
        tents, if I may say it repeatedly (for I, in an addition, am
        a poet), appear to be sailboats in the desert. Thus, after the
        morning session, we will convene in Building 242 for tea, the
        prayers of all religions, and the making of bombs. No one is
        to be insulted, not even if they do not know how.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Then we will reconvene, as I
        have said, and talk concerning Ethnography, including the customs
        of Christian animists to the south, the poignancy of American
        magazines like _Look_and _Cross Cultural Poetics_, and the rituals
        of Buffalo List of Poets.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, I am sorry. The situation
        is very complicated. But here, as the saying goes, we are. Here
        also, please, is a poem by a youth named Leonel Rugama whom we
        have invited too, except sadly he was beheaded long ago, at 20
        years, by Green Beret students in the country of Nicaragua:</FONT></P>

        poems. Don't you agree it was translated, without doubtfulness,
        by someone most self-congratulatory, so angry at his own country,
        yet blind as Oedipus to the terrorisms of non-white peoples?
        (Forgive me. I am smoking opium from Afghanistan. It betters
        my English, which you can tell is getting better as this letter,
        like a martyr, spills.) Of course, Mr. David, the trip (including
        camels) is long, like torture, apparently, in its likeness, and
        you shall be compelled to gift-forth your own plane-fare. In

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">[Three pages into the letter]...What
        do you expect? Talking to poets about that is something like
        [Carlo Emilio] Gadda getting up to make a toast at the Royal
        wedding in Lisbon, 1909 [1910 is the year of the establishment
        of Portugal's First Republic, KJ] and then launching into a discourse
        about fucking. Well, what is fucking? I will tell you what fucking
        is: It is 1) the most elemental of topics (the regal guests would
        never have made it to the wedding without it), and it is 2) the
        most taboo of topics (for the regal guests, that is, who turn
        away in embarrassment, both for themselves and the man discoursing
        about it)....</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Sorry about the mail, it is
        so slow. When are you sailing? I have sent you two weeks ago
        a copy of the new number of Orpheu, in which I have a long poem,
        Oda Maritima. Pessoa is also in the number.... [etc.]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">fair greetings,</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">[The letter continues on at
        great length regarding internecine poetry wars in Lisbon. The
        &quot;that&quot; to which de Campos refers is the ideologically
        conventionalized conception of authorship about which a modest
        controversy had been provoked by Fernando Pessoa (the very creator
        of de Campos and Reis) through his publication of the poems by
        the shepherd Alberto Caeiro in a previous issue of Orpheu. KJ]</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Instructor Kent Johnson<BR>
        Spanish Language<BR>
        The Highland Community University<BR>
        Freeport, Illinois 61032</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Instructor Kent Johnson:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I am a visitant Professor to
        Brown University in the fields of Luso-Iberian Poetry, and the
        Librarian Henry Gould has told me about the essay separated into
        various articulations that you are typing on the Internet Listserv
        called SukSuk. Therefore, he shared with myself (through the
        medium of the electronic mailing, consequently my incredible
        speed) the letter by de Campos to Reis that you fragmented for
        your companions. I am happy to have found it. There is a very
        large amusement park right in front of my present lodgings.<BR>
<BR>
        Neverthemore, I must bring forth a correction for you. The letter
        in question is not of the mad author de Campos; it is by the
        diffident Bernardo Soares, a very important distinction to be
        making, I'm sure you would consent to me.<BR>
<BR>
        But my focicle is the following, to share with you the text (fragmented)
        of a letter written to me by another friend of Henry Gould, the
        Professor Edwin Honig, also of Brown University, and honored
        some years ago by my country for his service to my country, awarded
        to a different scholar, by the force of Law, from a different
        country.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In the end, I do not think he
        would mind, for poets are always roasting their minds on a spit,
        in any case. Privacy is a hoax. Well then.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Mr. Honig has said of Fernando
        Pessoa:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;The stratagem behind such
        metamorphoses has been tried but scarcely probed by modern poets
        casting off the subjective self [by the way, sorry to interrupt,
        please, but do the Linguistic Poets say that they cast off the
        subjective self also? I believe Mr. Gould said to me that they
        say so]: to cope with estranged fragments of poetic identity
        by making specific dramatic characters out of them, occasionally
        lifted from one's personal life {...} The practice also serves
        to mute momentarily the disquieting problem of how to continue
        in a world inimical to poetic survival: Be not one poet but four
        or even nineteen! [Excuse me again, please, but here, undoubtedly,
        Professor Honig means that a tasking of the poets of avant-gardeness
        is to make forth multiple authors and let them run in the world
        to see what will manifest from them. How referential like a fetish
        to be merely one &quot;real&quot; Author or Academic! Please
        excuse me for my interruptings.]<BR>
        When he wrote, 'I am a nomadic wanderer through my consciousness,'
        he was stating the condition of the post-Romantic who, finding
        no model in the past, was left to rummage through his consciousness
        for whatever guidance the search might generate. The sentence
        further implies that the alien 'I' does not belong to 'my consciousness,'
        and hence is detached and something different from the central
        *I*. In pursuit of the other, the wanderer keeps translating
        the inscrutable messages of consciousness by impersonating, as
        translators do, the absent author himself, possibly to achieve
        some affective identification with a fictive self-- perhaps a
        hypothetical former self, perhaps a self-to-be...&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Incidentally, in the light of
        these reflections, it was interesting to myself to attend the
        Convention of the Modern Language Association in Chicago the
        last year and to sit in a lobby of the Hilton regarding the Professors.
        I thought to myself: Is there any hope for poetry other than
        a boring Poetry of Poets? Fashion and circumstance answered no,
        en absoluto.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I should add, Instructor Johnson,
        that I understand you have poetic readings at your University.
        I also am a man of craft, with five authors to my Alexandria
        of names, and I would be honored to come to your village. Anything
        to get out of Providence for awhile, as they say... Or, failing
        this, please let us meet next time you are in this dead and infernal
        city.</FONT></P>

        forget from that simulacral city in reverse is sitting in a vast
        hall in an incredibly ornate czarist building made all of marble,
        crimson-draped windows towering out onto the Neva, swarms of
        rococoed cherubs overhead, Barrett facing me across the great
        mahogany table in a kind of late pinkish glow, looking quite
        uncomfortable, eating little spoonfuls of caviar, while half
        a dozen Stalinist officials from the Ministry of Culture raised

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Through the gentle and waking-dreamed
        eyes of Kevin Killian, I have glimpsed the little blowtorch you
        have held against their Faces. Against the feces of my children.
        All fucking by Poets takes place in Hell. You will need to learn
        how to write better. My enthusiasms.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have also seen all of your
        invented letters. The ones from the living are quite boring.
        The more interesting ones are from the dead. (Mr. Killian does
        not know I am looking through his eyes.)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There is not much time given
        for writing where I presently am. So I will tell you three things,
        and if you're smart, you will believe me:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">1) The entire matter is a very
        complicated situation, more complicated than you can presently
        imagine.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">2) You are right about their
        burned or smelly faces, but that will never mean you should not
        kiss the image of your own head.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">3) The whole problem began,
        in a sense, with The Beatles.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Letter from Jerome Rothenberg</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Kent Johnson:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I haven't written an e-mail
        for a long time (lol), but Pierre Joris tuned me in to the very
        long string of posts you are writing, and I feel it is time I
        wrote to you. Indeed, I have felt for a long time now that I
        should, ever since you made it public that Pierre and I had planned
        to run a whole special section of poems by Araki Yasusada in
        the second volume of Poems for the Millennium, and then withdrew
        our decision at the last minute when we heard the rumors.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The only reason I am writing
        at this time is to tell you that we both feel a great deal of
        remorse over the matter now. For one, it was unfair to the actual
        late writer of the poems and letters, Tosa Motokiyu (tho I understand
        that is only a pseudonym in turn); for another, it was unfair
        to you, in a sense, since you had answered our request, as caretaker
        of Motokiyu's estate, and sent us the poems; and finally, it
        was unfair to our truest principles as poets and editors, for
        our decision, one admittedly made under the pressure of ideological
        and archival forces we weren't fully cognizant of at the time,
        has made it appear to some that we were more interested in publishing
        &quot;avant-garde&quot; Poets than &quot;avant-garde&quot; poems.
        I hope you will accept our deepest apologies and regrets.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I have done quite a bit of thinking
        on the matter, and it seems to me that this idea of heteronymity
        or hyperauthorship (as you sometimes refer to it) is extremely
        interesting and an almost totally neglected ideational field
        in poetic studies. I believe, like you, that fascinating things
        will be happening in the future that will deeply change what
        we think about poetry and what it can and should do. Therefore,
        I would like to invite you to enter into correspondence with
        the small group of poets on the Hudson Valley Poetry Listserv,
        where Charles Stein, Don Byrd, Pierre, Robert Kelly, Elizabeth
        Robinson, George Quasha, Jed Rasula, David Hess, Barbara Guest,
        myself, and a few others hang out and chat. In December, our
        topic is to be &quot;Pessoa's Trunk: Black Box or Time Machine&quot;?
        We have also invited a number of Pessoa scholars to join us,
        as well as Jacques Derrida, who has expressed tentative interest.
        Please feel free to extend an invitation to your co-executor
        in London, Javier Alvarez, as well.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I would be delighted to hear
        back from you. If and when I do, I will send you the subscription
        particulars forthwith. If you are still in touch with him, please
        give my regards to Henry Gould, for whom I warmly and publicly
        expressed my admiration at Poetics about a year before he suddenly
        and strangely disappeared.</FONT></P>

        The Parthenon, or something like that, reading The Paris Review
        roundtable discussion about The State of Poetry Today, with participants
        Harold Bloom, Stephen Burt, Frank Kermode, William Logan, Daniel
        Mendelsohn, Richard Poirier, Richard Lamb, and Helen Vendler.
        In the forty or so pages of commentary about dozens of the &quot;greatest
        poets,&quot; living and dead, there is not one mention of a single
        non-Caucasian-- and only three passing mentions of non-English
        language poets (Brodsky is one, dismissed as the most overrated
        poet in the world, and Cavafy, and Rilke). It's really quite
        amazing. Is America a racist and eurocentric culture? My God,
        I'm beginning to wonder!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Not that it has anything to
        do with this astounding state of affairs in the Paris Review,
        because it doesn't, but any minute, I thought, Barrett Watten
        will walk in the door, looking like he just stepped out of GQ
        magazine (Wayne State University is only a few bombed-out buildings
        down the street from The Parthenon), but he never did, and I
        doubt he would have recognized me even if he had, all fancied
        up and lipsticked in drag as I was.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Anyway, in this Paris Review
        piece (which, indeed, is remarkarbly like Detroit in many different
        ways), is an analogy that struck me as so interesting I thought
        I would ask what people thought about it: Richard Lamb says,
        &quot;It sometimes seems like poetry is the first art to become
        a sport. The writer/common reader model has broken down in favor
        of a sort of generalized participatory *aficion*. Few baseball
        fans never play baseball (Marianne Moore might have been an exception)
        [Jack Spicer was probably another, but this is not the kind of
        piece in which one would find mention of him, KJ]; likewise there
        are poetry sandlots and diamonds all over the place. And some
        Shea Stadiums. The result is lively but fuzzy.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The rest of the day, in between
        sipping my Retsina and making eyes at the handsome Greek waiters,
        I wondered: If this baseball comparison is true, what then is
        our Subsub? Is it an American Legion team learning the ropes?
        Is it a high school team full of up-and-comers? Is subsub an
        obscure farm team in AA, full of frustrated wanna be's? Is it
        like a team in the old Negro Leagues, neglected but loaded with
        talent? Is it a sandlot team full of wishful dreams? A bar league
        softball team drunk and playing for fun? A Playstation baseball
        team on a computer screen? To what might we compare &quot;our&quot;
        team?</FONT></P>
