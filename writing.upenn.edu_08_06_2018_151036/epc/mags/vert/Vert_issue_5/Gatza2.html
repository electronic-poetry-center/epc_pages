          it was an act of throwing you out.<BR>

          after the Olympic Park blast, which resulted in two deaths and

          111 serious injuries. <BR>

          But the accolades turned to suspicion - and non-stop scrutiny

          by the world's media - after FBI sources began telling the Atlanta

          media that Jewell fit the profile of a loner with law enforcement

          training capable of planting the explosives. <BR>

          Jewell and his mother, Barbara, were held under siege in their

          Northeast Atlanta apartment as FBI agents confiscated Jewell's

          possessions and searched his home, storage shed and pickup truck

          for clues. All the while, TV crews kept a vigil outside the home.

<BR>

          ``I felt like a hunted animal, followed constantly, waiting to

          be killed,'' Jewell said. ``After 88 days of hell, it's hard

          to believe it is finally over.''</FONT></P>

          a hero who defines the age <BR>

          On the evening of July 27th, 1996, at Centennial Olympic Park,

          I did not set out to be a hero. I set out that night simply to

          do my job and to do it right. I was then and remain now an individual

          committed to the principles of law enforcement and the protection

          of the public. I was trained to spot the unattended packages

          and to report such packages to the next person in the security

          chain of command.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">That is what I did on the 27th

          of July. All I did was my job.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I moved people away from the

          unattended package and I evacuated people from the sound tower.

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When the explosion occurred,

          I saw my fellow officers and friends flying through the air.

          I saw people lying on the ground hurt, badly hurt.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The media started calling me

          a hero. I did not consider myself a hero. The bomb technician

          who crawled on his belly and got next to the bomb was a hero.

          The officers who took the shrapnel by placing their bodies between

          the package and where the people were in the park were the heroes.</FONT></P>

          responded so quickly and treated the <BR>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And then, the FBI and the media

          decided to portray me as the bomber. It was like being broadsided.

          Anybody who knew me understood that I could never hurt another

          person. I love people. I love children. I am a public servant.

          I felt numb, sick, I was in shock and felt helpless.</FONT></P>

          people perceive the violence, envy, misery, presented on the

          they recognize themselves in it and get to know themselves from

          formerly forbidden angles.&quot; She also points out that children

          or adolescents with problems of loneliness, abandonment or frustration,

          will try to compensate for those situations by watching programs,

          such as cartoons, aimed mainly at children. Lacking adequate

          role models in real life, children will choose screen heroes

          Jewell was seen talking on his radio near a lighting tower at

          Olympic Park just before the blast. <BR>

          When another officer approached, according to court documents

          unsealed Monday, Jewell told the officer, ``It's a bomb. I've

          already called law enforcement. Let's get out of here.'' Within

          10 seconds, a knapsack at the foot of the lighting tower exploded,

          the officer told investigators. <BR>

          Most of the evidence gathered by FBI investigators in the newly

          released reports is indirect, and none directly incriminates

          him in building or placing the bomb. <BR>

          One acquaintance described Jewell as ``an adrenaline junkie''

          who craved action, and another said that Jewell expressed hope

          he would be ``right in the middle of it'' if police were needed

          during the Games. <BR>

          A former law enforcement colleague - also unnamed in the documents

          - told the FBI Jewell was ``blackballed'' from police work because

          of his troubled record, and speculated Jewell might have seen

          Olympic heroism as a way of getting another police job.</FONT></P>

          it. ... He didn't have a girlfriend, just the job.'' <BR>

          and (name deleted) got the impression that Jewell had gone to

          a continuing education course concerning bombing matters.'' <BR>

          ``He worked the (Olympic park) sound tower seven days a week

          for 12 hours a day and did not want any days off. Jewell put

          </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We're not in an information

          age. We're in an interactive one. It's not bits we're exchanging

          but our very essence in the form of ideas, E-mails, graphics

          and chat dialogue...<BR>

          the primary socializer of children, with its role amplified and

          extended by the school, the church or mosque or synagogue or

          temple, and the larger community. <BR>

          we are exposed to a staggering amount of entertainment and information

          about how the world works and what it is that makes life worth

          living. <BR>

          They learn a lot from this &quot; informal curriculum&quot; -

          about heroes and villains and victims, about being male and being

          female, about how to achieve success in life, about who's got

          power and who doesn't, about violence and intimate relations

          and what constitutes &quot;the good life&quot;.<BR>

          the pervasiveness of television in children's lives is by no

          means an indication that children are satisfied with what they

          are watching.<BR>

          Contrary to popular belief heavy TV viewing actually cultivates

          a <B>fear</B> of violence:<BR>

          &quot;Heavy viewers of TV violence suffer from a 'Mean World

          Syndrome' and that has all kinds of consequences. They are more

          likely to overestimate their chances of encountering violence,

          to believe that their neighborhoods are unsafe and to assume

          that crime is rising, whether or not it actually is.&quot;</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Reasons for the 'Mean World

          Syndrome' are not hard to find. Violent crime is far more pervasive

          on television than in real life. &quot;Since 1955, television

          characters have been murdered at a rate 1000 times higher than

          real world victims have. News is even more influential than entertainment

          television in creating the sense of a world of heightened dangers.</FONT></P>

          <P>&nbsp;</P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It can be very tempting to focus

          on media violence without paying attention to the culture as

          a whole. (When asked to select measures which would reduce violent

          crime &quot;a lot&quot;, many Americans chose restrictions on

          TV violence more frequently than gun control.79) It takes more

          than television programs, films, video games and demeaning lyrics

          to turn children into violent adults. Real-life experience with

          poverty, violence, abuse or neglect is a very powerful determinant.

          One thing is certain: media violence has a much greater impact

          on children who have experienced violence first-hand and see

          it as &quot;natural&quot;.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">After 88 days of hell, it is

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I want to thank my friends,

          who stood by me during the darkest of days. Many of them were

          subjected to FBI harassment, but they still stood by me and told

          the truth. I thank all of you out there in America and around

          the world who expressed support for me and outrage for what happened

          to me.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I hope and pray that no one

          else is ever subjected to the pain and the ordeal that I have

          gone through. In the future I hope that the authorities move

          with caution and not be overzealous in their desire to solve

          crimes.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The authorities should keep

          in mind the rights of the citizens. I hope that the media will

          curb its appetite for the substantial story by staying objective,

          by reporting truthfully, and not distorting the facts.</FONT></P>

          </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Many children need and

          use media heroes as role models to help them compensate for and

          escape from difficult situations. In a recent study on global

          media violence conducted by UNESCO, 51% of children from high-aggression

          neighborhoods wanted to be like Terminator, as opposed to 37%

          from low-aggression settings. As the educators in Responding

          to Media Violence point out: &quot;Sometimes the appeal of such

          images lies in the instruction they offer youngsters on how to

          be strong, how to protect oneself and how to become the aggressor

          instead of the victim.&quot;</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Geoffrey Gatza lives in Buffalo

          NY with his two cats, Blaze &amp; Clarice. His work is set in

          consumer iconographic texts that is instantly recognizable in

          its settings of classical &amp; religious poetry. The narrative

          is plain to any red-blooded American worthy of their suspenders,

          or at least the parody will not escape the blackest of holes.

          To quote Bart Simpson, &quot;The ironing is delicious.&quot;

          Gatza continues, &quot;To only see this work from the printed

          page is to see it as the cereal box top graphics I try to emulate.

          A computer screen or newspapers, perhaps allows for the soft,

          almost a muting of lines, which the printed medium often negates.

          This takes a decidedly different stance from Enzio Feregara whose

          poetry is plainly absurd.&quot;</FONT></P>
