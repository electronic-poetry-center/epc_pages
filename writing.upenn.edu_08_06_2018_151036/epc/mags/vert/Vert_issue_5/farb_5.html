        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Cities Under Hats</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">with our foreheads extending
        there is now room to ponder</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the madmen plotting new operas
        to be dragged through an imaginary jungle of pomegranates and
        gasoline</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">indiscreet habits in mixed company,
        resulting in subtly orchestrated movements against oneself and
        at the mercy of three stout men in leather hats</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">male models drenched in lavender
        who leave pearlescent trails</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the music of street sirens emanating
        from abducted automobiles, which will later find their way homes
        like lost kittens, only to discover that their purposes have
        been fulfilled by opiated laborers with vast debts</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the great golden chests that
        crowd out old religions</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">myriad shades of blue paint
        along antique rooftops, forever obscuring a sky grown tedious
        and opaque with God's didactic brush</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">rushing streams of caffeine,
        devoid of boats and rife with electricity, erecting skyscrapers
        overnight with vital pieces missing</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the vine-entwined terrace where
        in the course of their independent journeys two ladies met, lunched,
        and then parted, never to know that they shared a single undisclosed
        secret and could have blown away the helium balloon of guilt
        that shrouded their mornings</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">state-sanctioned diets of plantains
        and hydroproxyl, endorsed by celebrities generated by massive
        computer banks with loathsome and middling predilections unforeseen
        by their information technology administrators</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">purely fantastic window dressings
        inducing longings for indulgence that will go unquenched in our
        lifetime</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the angular walk of the gray-clad
        specters that we left to do our dirty work</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">secretive winding stairwells
        that lack proper handrails, inviting those of us with too much
        time on our hands to briefly consider an invitation to mortality
        which we shy away from for fear of an even more interminable
        boredom</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">letters filled with unspoken
        sentences that go uncomposed and unsent due to the modern mistrust
        of American postal services in an age of irrelevant wages</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">and paper houses by the river
        banks</FONT></P>

        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A. Goldfarb walks upon clouds
        of his own making, ready to fall at any moment. He has been published
        in Shattered Wig, Drivers Side Airbag, Mirage #4/Period(ical)
        #97 and something unpronounceable from Macedonia. His shoe size
        is ten, and he cares about you a great deal.<BR>
