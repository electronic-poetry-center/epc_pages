      An Interview with Kent Johnson</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Araki Yasusada, an Hiroshima

      survivor who died of cancer in 1972, began to have his poems

      published in Western journals in the mid-1990's. His work was

      praised by both mainstream and experimental poets and critics

      for a combination of what seemed to be a traditional Japanese

      style and more innovative elements, and a book deal had been

      negotiated with Wesleyan University Press. However, word soon

      began to spread that there was no Yasusada and that the poems

      in fact had been written by Kent Johnson, an American poet who

      had acted as an intermediary between Yasusada's &quot;translators&quot;

      and the journals which published the poems. Johnson claims that

      Tosa Motokiyu, the pseudonym for one of the translators who is

      now dead, is the actual author. The response was immediate and

      often hostile. Wesleyan refused to publish the work, although

      Roof released <I>Doubled Flowering: From the Notebooks of Araki

      Yasusada</I>, in 1997. American Poetry Review editor Arthur Vogelsang,

      who had published some of the poems, said the hoax was &quot;essentially

      a criminal act.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But one aspect makes this different

      from previous hoaxes such as the inventions of Thomas Chatterton

      or James Macpherson: it seems as if Johnson, or whomever is in

      fact the author, wanted it to be discovered. There are a number

      of errors and anachronisms in both Yasusada's poetry and his

      biography which are so glaring that they must be intentional.

      &quot;Araki&quot; is a fairly common family name in Japan, but

      his alleged translators exclusively refer to him as &quot;Yasusada,&quot;

      which would suggest either that he had a very unusual given name

      or that the translators were unfamiliar with Japanese nomenclature.

      A similar problem occurs with Yasusada's wife's name, Nomura,

      which is also a family name. The biography states Yasusada studied

      at Hiroshima University in the 1920's, although that institution

      wasn't founded until 1949. The translators claim Yasusada read

      the poet Paul Celan in the 1930's; Celan's first volume was not

      published until 1952 -- and then in German, which Yasusada did

      not read. Yasusada's letters have him reading and citing books

      years before they were published. Similar &quot;errors&quot;

      abound.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As a result, the Yasusada poems

      raise a number of very important questions about contemporary

      culture. To what extent does the work of art exist without the

      artist to whom it is attributed? Are the poems sincere meditations

      on a terrible tragedy, or are they little more than a hoax or

      publicity stunt? More generally, what makes a poem or an author

      &quot;real?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In the wake of the Yasusada

      controversy, Kent Johnson has been an eloquent and provocative

      commentator on many aspects of art and politics. In addition

      to <I>Doubled Flowering</I>, his books include <I>A Nation of

      Poets: Writing from the Workshops of Nicaragua </I>(Los Angeles:

      West End Press) 1985; <I>Beneath a Single Moon: Buddhism in Contemporary

      American Poetry</I> (Boston: Shambhala) 1991, edited with Craig

      Paulenich; and <I>Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry</I> (Ann

      refuses, to his dying day, to claim this writing under his own

      name? In the special issue of Boundary 2, 99 Poets/1999, edited

      by Charles Bernstein, the expatriate Syrian poet Adonis proposes

      the following about poetry's future task:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>

          <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">To save itself,

          poetry will need to progressively espouse the unknown eternal

          truths and refuse again and again to be regimented from the outside

          by any kind of ideology, system, or institution....[P]oetry will

          have to advance by exploring regions the invader cannot reach....[T]he

          traditional view of the poem cannot survive, it will have to

          be transformed in its very structure. Just as the traditional

          concept of poetry has already broadened to exceed the limits

          of traditional forms of speech, so, in order to resist the utilitarian

          goals which nearly strangled it this century, in order to escape

          ideology, the structure of poetic language will have to open

          itself to more movement, and move always toward a concept of

          the total poem.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This is well said, and I would

      say that this movement or opening toward the &quot;total poem&quot;

      will also require a sloughing-off of narrow and fake notions

      of authenticity. It will mean a guerrilla war of the heart against

      the ideology of the Author.</FONT></P>

      should cease to attribute their poems to their persons. That

      would be more than a quixotic proposal. So I'm not suggesting

      that modes and versions of heteronymity will totally replace

      traditional conceptions of authorship. Nor, I should say, will

      any move to something truer and more authentic have anything

      to do with simple notions of anonymity. As Mikhail Epstein, the

      prominent Russian theorist and critic wrote in a letter to Yasusada's

      creator, Tosa Motokiyu, in 1996:</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Poststructuralism has pronounced

          the death sentence for the individual author(ship), but does

          this mean that we are doomed to return to the pre-literary stage

          of anonymity? One cannot enter twice the same river, and anonymity

          in its postauthorial, not pre-authorial, implementation will

          turn into something different from folklore anonymity. What would

          be, then, a progressive, not retrospective, way out of the crisis

          of individual authorship? Not anonymity, I believe, but hyperauthorship.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As in the physical world one

      has Newtonian and quantum mechanics coexisting in paradoxical

      simultaneity, so also will classical Authorship and heteronymic

      has not even yet begun to be observed...</FONT></P>

      believe there will be, in this future and broad-based &quot;refusal

      to be regimented from the outside,&quot; a more subtle and fluid

      relationship with poetic identity as legally and culturally,

      even biologically, circumscribed. And in this resistance to regimentation

      the circulation of created, fully-realized hyperauthorships will

      become a vibrant and branching and authentic utopian space, with

      schools and collaborations, journals and sub-genres, critical

      forays and epistolary crossings. I think that readers will flock

      to this apocryphal space and jump in, grateful to abide in mystery

      and to pursue the traces, clues, and revelations its authors

      leave behind. Poets both real and not real will move in shimmering

      ways back and forth between realms and across times. Cross-disciplinary

      forms and genres unimaginable at present will flower forth. It

      will be a &quot;wavy&quot; zone impossible to appropriate or

      to discipline, because authorship in this topography will not

      have a discrete location or body; it will be continuum-like,

      a wave, to draw from Epstein again, going across times, places,

      and personalities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But this will require strong

      conceptual moves that leave behind the vanishing point of genetic

      ascription and push poetic- performative activity-- sometimes

      illicitly and against &quot;known laws&quot;-- beyond the generic

      canvass-horizon of the page.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">BF:</FONT><FONT

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This

      sounds visionary, with a tinge of the mystical, maybe. Some of

      what you're saying reminds me of the Neoists, who fought against

      the capitalist appropriation of the figure of the artist by producing

      works under the name Karen Eliot. Likewise, they sponsored what

      they called Festivals of Plagiarism which included works which

      borrowed, reworked and, yes, plagiarized other works. While that

      seemed like a good way of directing attention to the commodification

      of both &quot;art&quot; and &quot;the artist,&quot; it's interesting

      to note that Stewart Home, one of the primary Neoists, has moved

      more recently toward what can only be described as outright mysticism

      (although he suggests this celebration of the occult is a parodic

      way of undermining the ideology of capitalism). Can we question

      the commodified figure of the artist without sliding into a more

      mystical approach which is little better than the system it purports

      to replace?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT></B><FONT

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Yes, what I'm talking about is a bit

      of a vision, admittedly, but it is grounded in a materialist,

      not mystical position. As to the Neoists, in their second incarnation

      via Mail-Art and Home, they foreshadow a much more significant

      anarcho-cultural phenomenon: the still-unfolding collective pseudonym

      Luther Blissett, which began as an Umberto Eco-inspired cell

      in Italy and has rapidly spread, largely via the Web, to other

      nations. This is a fascinating development, and its hoaxes, pranks,

      hacks, and Situationist-like antics have garnered a good deal

      of media play. But Luther Blissett and Karen Eliot bear little

      in common with Yasusada: the former are anarcho-deconstructive

      in intent and function, the latter is utopic-constructive; the

      former vacuums up creative minds in monolithic anonymity under

      a single name, the latter represents the sowing of new authorships

      by creative minds seeking to disseminate identity in fluid configurations.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Now to get back to the issue

      of mysticism, I can't fully agree with the premises of your question.

      There will be many mystics, many odd, spiritualistic characters

      in the future exfoliations of a heteronymic general economy.

      Heteronymous materialists will attack them violently, to be sure,

      but it would be unmaterialist to assert that materialism has

      won the debate in advance. Are super-strings, or wormholes, or

      parallel universes, or Barbourian now-capsules matter or spirit,

      for example, and what do these terms mean, truly, when we talk

      about such things? Why is there something rather than nothing,

      as Leibniz asked 300 years back? There's been no answer yet.

      The question heteronymy proposes is materialist in character

      and intent; no one can say what the final response, if there

      is one, will be.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The underlying contradiction

      that provides the traction for setting forth, the &quot;regimentation&quot;

      that demands new destinations, is quite clear in its general

      outline: poetic production, in the US, Russia, Uruguay, Martinique,

      The Vatican, or Japan is stuck on the page and inside the body

      brace of the Name. The Name is what validates and envalues; it

      is the relay pole through which the current of the culture industry

      moves; it is the hole through which the invader enters and appropriates;

      it is the watermark that guarantees the currency. It's comfortable

      and respectable to circulate there. What, after all, could seem

      more natural? If your mutual fund grows big enough, you can even

      buy a job. But poetry's yearning cannot be contained indefinitely

      by this system, and it is fated to burst the outmoded form that

      presently binds it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Marx said, &quot;The task of

      history, once the world beyond the truth has disappeared, is

      to establish the truth of this world.&quot; For poets-- or at

      least for those poets who take the notion of a revolution in

      poetic language seriously-- the task is now. There is no need

      to wait for &quot;the world beyond the truth&quot; to disappear.

      There is no need, either, for a &quot;transitional stage&quot;

      of practice that requires some kind of &quot;collaborationist&quot;

      interregnum with the reigning regime. The task is one of permanent

      poetic revolution-- a progressive espousal, as Adonis, again,

      puts it, of the unknown eternal truths that can only be discovered

      outside of &quot;any kind of ideology, system, or institution.&quot;

      In order to begin this espousal, in order to begin establishing

      the poetic truth of this world, we must show, by deeds and not

      just claims, how phantasmagoric the world of the Author beyond

      the truth truly is.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> The fractal proliferation of new, created

      authorships will show this, dismantling and liberating in a single

      gesture. Their multiplication across times and places will expose

      heretofore invisible conjoinings and practices. This will constitute

      a qualitatively new condition of poesis, one that will unfold

      beyond the penal, disciplinary rituals of the old order. The

      world of the Author we are now in is a vast and flattened circle

      of cells around a great tower at the center which sees from above

      and all around. Most of the prisoners happily accept their state;

      a few souls try to wiggle their way under the walls here or there,

      but they do so while singing about it at the top of their lungs.

      The song is called, &quot;Here I am, my name is inmate so and

      so, I occupy cell number such and such, and I'm trying to wiggle

      my way under the wall.&quot; Obviously, they won't get out this

       FACE="Tahoma">I'm not talking here just about the poets at the

      Associated Writing Programs convention or at the New Yorker party.

      The so-called avant-garde in the U.S., for example, is by and

      large in a poetic/panoptic Flat-Land, poets squiggling about,

      trying to make squiggles distinctive from those of the poets

      of the Academy of American Poets, for example. They are doing

      some interesting squiggles in those two dimensions, the so-called

      avant-garde is, but there are many other dimensions, and one

      can stand up in them and even fly, maybe, or be in two places,

      or more, at once. But if you are &quot;so and so&quot; poet because

      that's what it says on your social security card, you are stuck

      in a certain space that is constructed for you, and the reader

      is too, no matter how odd the form or language of your poem in

      <I>Poems for the Millennium</I>.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I think this is one of the reasons

      poetry of any kind is not interesting to most people, and why

      so many of those who do find it interesting find it so for surface

      considerations... Poetry, alas, has become too much a kind of

      entomology, a collection of chrysalis-like authenticities all

      too happy to be plucked and pinned in display inside the tower

      at the structure's center. Poeticus charlesenius olsonius, Poeticus

      robertus pinskynius, Poeticus brucenius andrewsei, etc. ...The

      multiple specimens have variations in size, marking, and color,

      but they all stem, ideo-phylogenetically, from the originary

      genus. It's quite easy to fit each species-- even the exotic

      kind-- into its proper place in the Archive.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The truth is that professional

      wrestling, which is brazenly fake on one level, has a much more

      interesting and complex relationship to cultural reality than

      99.9% of poetry does today. Poetry should and could be much more

      sophisticated in its generic-conceptual performative operations

      than professional wrestling, of course. Right now it is less

      so.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But I don't claim any special

      powers of understanding these matters. I'm quite aware I'm not

      as literarily-talented or quick-minded as many of those poets

      trapped in the Flat-Land. It's simply that I've been associated,

      by great coincidence and fortune, with a work that has proven

      to have a subtle and powerful (if largely unintended) critique

      of the present state of poetic affairs. And I think Yasusada

      has done a little bit of good work in laying bare the fake consciousness

      of so much poetic authenticity. Anyway, so no, because I guess

      I'm still answering your first question, I do not feel that the

      words &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;hoax&quot; are applicable to

      Yasusada in any productive sense.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This

      is interesting -- what you're calling for bears some obvious

      similarities to the work of Fernando Pessoa, the Portuguese poet

      who wrote under a variety of what he called &quot;heteronyms,&quot;

      a term you used earlier, wholly different personae with very

      different styles and approaches to poetry. Most of Pessoa's work

      dates from the 1920's and 1930's, and although he has a reasonably

      strong literary reputation, I wonder if many readers might be

      skeptical about such a project now. Is it possible that with

      the advent of digital special effects, HDTV, and high resolution

      But one could also speculate, <I>au contraire</I>, that the Author

      Function's contemporary cramp-grip on writing and reading culture

      is in part symptom of a collective, pathological yearning for

      simulacral states. Authenticity or Truth, however you put it,

      is a mysterious and troubling notion, and I think most people

      intuitively know it has only something superficial to do with

      what can be empirically verified. Death, for example, is a very

      authentic and true state, but no one alive knows what it truthfully

      is. So it seems defensible to hypothesize that what people are

      after nowadays is not so much &quot;the Authentic&quot;; they

      are after, rather, authenticity's simulacral and constructed

      Figure, ready-made in the Author's image. It's a comfort zone,

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Susan Stewart, in the magisterial

      book <I>Crimes of Writing </I>sees the postmodern as marked by

      &quot;the invention of a mass-market subjectivity of authorial

      'stardom' within a context of deepening anonymity.&quot; And

      it's interesting to consider a relationship between the unprecedented

      hegemony of this zeitgeist and the rapid proliferation of simulacral

      technologies over the past, say, thirty years or so. I remember

      that Eliot Weinberger back in the late 80's proposed in Sulfur

      magazine that &quot;Language poetry,&quot; which probably stands

      as the most influential avant-garde poetic movement on an international

      scale since the Beats, could only be fully understood in the

      big cultural context of post-modern sound-bite technology effects.

      There was a big brouhaha over that, and Weinberger has been more

      or less reviled by many of the Language writers and their fellow

      travelers ever since. But in truth, we've seen many of the leading

      figures of that movement rapidly devolve since then, in ways

      quite consistent with Weinberger's early critique. They've gone

      from an aggressive &quot;anti-self&quot; theoretical stance,

      utopianly proclaimed in decidedly non-mainstream publications,

      to an embarrassing embrace of as much authorial stardom as the

      academic/culture industry will grant them. And if that means

      publishing your books with Harvard, Chicago, Princeton, Cambridge,

      and Oxford, or making clownish sound-bite appearances on national

      TV for the Yellow Pages at Rose Bowl half-time, as Charles Bernstein,

      the most famous &quot;Language&quot; poet did in 1999, so be

      it.</FONT></P>

      writing students. To these students I'd recommend Professor Tensfeldrockh

      in Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus from way back in 1831: &quot;Clothes

      gave us individuality, distinction, social polity; Clothes have

      made Men of us; they are threatening to make Clothes-screens

      of us.&quot; In other words, beware of designer-labeled fashion

       FACE="Tahoma">There are some hints. I consider Alan Sondheim,

      in his multiple incarnations, to be a poet leaping, in fascinating

      ways, between dimensions. He/They is moving at a speed and volume

      most so-called experimentalists can barely fathom. A number of

      historically rigorous and lyrically bizarre poems put up on the

      Buffalo Poetics List in 1999 by the pseudonym &quot;Lynn Miller&quot;

      sent out rays in a number of promising directions, though whether

      Miller will expand from simplistic, two-dimensional pseudonymity

      into a full-fledged heteronymity is not clear. Another partial

      example would be the OULIPO, their work collectively considered.

      In the works of the OULIPO, authorial attribution has become

      a kind of meaningless carapace left behind after the creature

      has been boiled and eaten. Much as in Sondheim, the name becomes

      a form of whispered joke, though one wonders, at times, if the

      writer gets it. Armand Schwerner, Jackson Mac Low, and John Cage

      are three writers who began to move toward the horizon line,

      but never quite jumped over. Nabokov, in Pale Fire, makes another,

      if differently configured, false rush at the line-- an expression

      of giant ego so incandescent it verges on auto-erasure. The works

      of these last four writers have a doubleness to them, a centaur

      quality that lights up the overripe and ready-to-burst skin of

      legal Authorship: they are like figures whose legs and torsos

      are transparent and liquid in weirdest ways, but their heads

      are glossy and air-brushed, like a Barnes and Noble promo photo.

      The uneven and combined nature of their development is harbinger

      of revolutionary transformations to come. Motokiyu, though certainly

      not as talented an artist as these last examples, stands on their

      shoulders and glimpses something dialectically beyond.</FONT></P>

      questions. Wordsworth was one of the first writers to push for

       FACE="Tahoma">His betrayal of Coleridge and of his own earlier

      radical principles aside, Wordsworth's aesthetic was based on

      the individual's visionary voice. Copyright lends itself quite

      naturally to Romantic ontology and, consequently, to the great

      majority of poetry written today. But the aesthetic of the Language

      and so-called Post-Language poets is largely based on the idea

      that such I-centered, scenic claiming is part and parcel of ideology's

      fictionalizing function. They've written about this quite eloquently.

      But here these postmodern radicals are, stamping their texts

      with their mostly academic identities and copyrighting them as

      fast as they can churn them out. One might say that their betrayal

      is of a more candid type.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Speaking very figuratively,

      I had mentioned that any &quot;collaborationist&quot; sucking-up

      to the hegemony of the Author Function would necessarily fail

      to meet the demands of a true revolution in poetic language.

      Ironically, Barrett Watten, to whose work and person Aerial magazine

      devoted a fat, special issue, with BARRETT WATTEN printed in

      huge letters on the spine, has just written an essay arguing,

      with allusions to Kristeva, and with a strain that makes one

      wince, that half a dozen examples of collaboratively produced

      texts between Language poets stand as evidence of an avant-garde

      dismantling of conventional notions of authorship . Not quite,

      I'm afraid... Watten's main example is Legend, a five-person

      collaboration that he claims &quot;dissolves the individual,&quot;

      is &quot;supra-subjective,&quot; and &quot;is located precisely

      in the place of the utopian elsewhere/nowhere invoked by <I>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</I>'s

      articulation of authorial subject positions.&quot; But one must

      ask the embarrassingly obvious question: How can an authorial

      subject position be &quot;elsewhere/nowhere&quot; when its legal

      denomination so emphatically marks a textual/territorial site

      of ownership? The store has an address and number in the Yellow

      Pages, as they say Watten's claim that &quot;collaboration&quot;

      between avant-garde Authors represents the threshold for a shedding

      of the Author Law, as he puts it, would be almost touching in

      its naivete if the arch-academic rhetorical lingerie of his essay

      weren't so plainly the disingenuous costume of an &quot;experimental&quot;

      strip-tease for the Modern Language Association Convention.</FONT></P>

      is that Barrett Watten's apparent gifts would find their true,

      unbounded, and nomadic range were his identity not so theatrically

      on the Authorial stage, dramatically pretending it is not what

      it is. But alas, in the revisionist spirit of the bureaucratized

      Third International, the erstwhile vanguard Party of Language

      now stages &quot;collaboration&quot; with a corset-like mode

      of literary production as a poetics of &quot;revolution&quot;.

      make little hops and leaps but without ever, alas, getting very

      high off the ground. Or to rashly mix my analogies like I mix

      my metaphors, one could say that the heteronym is a form of Oulipean

      &quot;constraint,&quot; but one that arches, like a dome, above

      the semantic-lexical operations of the writing per se, creating

      an enclosure within which a certain conceptual &quot;heating

      controversy separated us. The last time I saw him, he placed

      his hand against my face without saying anything, and then turned

      and walked away. He once wrote, &quot;Why leave the fictional

      experiments to the fiction writers?&quot; The obvious answer

      is that it's strange indeed that contemporary poets have almost

      completely abdicated the field in this regard. In the future

      more significantly be how elegantly complex and genealogically

      subtle a tension the heteronymic figure enacts in relation to

      wider and unfolding context... For example, any poem by Ricardo

      Reis [a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa], classical in his aesthetics

      and monarchist in his politics, is profoundly more radical, from

      certain fictive correspondence between values of worth and exchange,

      and insofar as the legal Name in commodity-driven culture assumes

      the status of &quot;brand&quot; that is carefully and zealously

      superimposed on its product in preparation for circulation in

      the market, I suppose that heteronymic writing-- in addition

      to the above-mentioned creative and critical take-off a shadow

      economy of heteronymy would provide-- could well represent a

      symbolic and principled resistance to the appropriative functions

      of the Institution of Art-- a kind of civil disobedience, so

      to speak, against the IMF of the word: &quot;Oh, so in your generous

      openness you'll include us in your End of History if we privatize?

      Well, Fuck You, you haven't seen anything yet.&quot; As we saw

      recently in Seattle, civil disobedience can sometimes have a

      salutary impact. And as I was suggesting earlier, there are manifold

      versions of such &quot;civil disobedience&quot; waiting to be

      Poet Laureate Ted Hughes. He also claims, referring to you, that

      it is difficult to understand how someone who comes across as

      &quot;a windy and slightly paranoiac jerk&quot; in his published

      commentaries on the matter, could ever be the author of writing

      like Yasusada's, which he feels is brilliant, heart-breaking,

      and historically significant.</FONT></P>

       FACE="Tahoma">Well, I agree with everything Wojahn says. It's

      what I've been saying to smug, deaf ears all along. I am not

      Yasusada.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Why do you think Tosa Motokiyu, or

      whomever wrote the Yasusada poems, initially wanted to keep his

      or her heteronymity secret?</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT></B><FONT

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> My answer is necessarily speculative,

      because the issue was not something about which Alvarez or I

      ever entered into specific conversation with Moto. One always

      goes back and wishes for a second chance. Javier has a somewhat

      different view, but I feel strongly that Moto never really thought

      about it all that much-- at least not in any theoretical detail,

      with anticipation of all the discussion to come. The matter for

      him, rather, was what to do with poems he couldn't explain in

      any straight-forward, rational way: What was this other voice?

      Who was this non-living author who seemed, in all his complexity,

      to have had his own life and poetics? This is not to draw some

      kind of mystical curtain between Yasusada and Moto. They are

      not ever separate. But the former stands as a kind of metamorphosis

      or transcendence of the later. And so I think for Moto-- someone,

      by the way, not literate with the ins and outs of the American

      poetry business-- it was the most natural thing to present the

      poems in the &quot;transgressive&quot; way that they were.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Now, does the work contain the

      seeds of an ethnographic advance into the mountain hamlet of

      US poetry and, even, of the self-conscious dismantling of its

      own specific fictionality? Yes, clearly, as critics like Marjorie

      Perloff and Eliot Weinberger have pointed out. But the question

      (and this is where Alvarez and I differ) is to what extent there

      was an emplotment by Moto of the work's critical subversiveness,

      of its status as a time bomb that explodes and reappears, goes

      off again, comes back to tick and detonate, and so on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No matter what the case may

      be (and we'll never know, because Moto's notebooks don't contain

      clear clues), I think it's apparent that we should be grateful

      he presented the work as he did; we should be grateful he was

      beyond doubt that Yasusada would cease to be if he did not allow

      him to simply and completely exist as the author of his own writing.

      Otherwise, his afterlife, more real, more &quot;other&quot; than

      his initial one, and which is still unfolding, or going off,

      as I said, and much to the consternation of some, would never

      have been.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">BF:</FONT></B><FONT

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Some critics have questioned the ethics

      of using a <I>hibakusha</I>, or Hiroshima survivor, as an heteronym,

      arguing that that amounts to a politically questionable appropriation

      of a victim's voice. How would you respond to that?</FONT></P>

       FACE="Tahoma">I've spoken to this in previous exchanges. The

      term &quot;appropriation&quot; assumes a premeditated choice,

      one most likely made against better moral judgement. The phrase

      &quot;victim's voice&quot; assumes an effort at unmediated presentation,

      a &quot;victim&quot; speaking who would occlude the open wounds

      of his fictional body. This is not the case with <I>Doubled Flowering</I>.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Still, no matter what I say,

      there will be those-- particularly those professionally invested

      in certain notions of essentialism-- who will never be swayed.

      So be it. But Yasusada is not an &quot;appropriation&quot;; he

      is a deep and idiosyncratic work of empathy, one which provides,

      in the words of the critic Joe Lockard, &quot;a radical encounter

      with the thinness of human distinctions.&quot; Naturally, this

      bothers those who demand that empathy have checkpoints at the

      borders of &quot;the other's&quot; difference. Sweeping away

      their policing, Yasusada reveals, through the mirrored-layers

      of his text, how deeply the otherness of Hiroshima and its victims

      is inside &quot;us&quot;...</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You had alluded to plagiarism

      earlier (and I should say that Yasusada's translators almost

      always indicate, openly or slyly, those moments when he is borrowing),

      and in a recent interview I did with the Northern Arizona University

      linguist and Nahuatl language scholar Norbert Francis, I ended

      by poaching from a published exchange I had with the Japanese

      poet and critic Akitoshi Nagahata. In that spirit, I'd like to

      end this interview by plagiarizing from myself again, this time

      from another recent interview I recently did with the poet John

      Bradley, editor of a stunning new collection of essays from University

      of Arizona entitled<I> Learning to Glow: A Nuclear Reader</I>--

      a book that will probably not get the attention it deserves.

      Here is what I said:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Despite how some have &quot;sympathetically&quot;

      seen the work,<I> Doubled Flowering</I> is much more than an

      ironic commentary on cultural simulacra, much more than a clever

      experiment with historical identity, or what have you. Elements

      of theoretical things, as I've said, can be found. But it's much

      more helpful, to my mind, at least, to think of Yasusada's presence

      in a less rational light: as a form of haunting, a remnant, or,

      as Derrida has it in <I>Spectres of Marx</I>, a <I>reve-nant</I>,

      broken-off from the excess of trauma and mourning that flows

      out of Hiroshima through time and through us. Yasusada's shattered

      textual apparition stands, in success or failure, as an act of

      transmemoration. It's an aggressively transgressive act of remembrance,

      and that's fundamentally it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Yasusada emerges in Moto not

      as a dramatic persona who is plotted and crafted in cold advance,

      but as a force or imperative from within. The writer through

      whom this voice emerged withdraws and leaves a slender book of

      fragments as an after-image cast in Hiroshima's long sear. The

      shadows of Hiroshima are very disturbing. I would say that it

      is entirely appropriate, in this sense, that Yasusada's form,

      a faint shadow of shadows, has proven disturbing in its own small

      way.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The unspeakable that happened

      56 years ago, as I said, is deep inside us-- &quot;East&quot;

      and &quot;West&quot;. The work of facing, of mourning Hiroshima

      and Nagasaki is barely begun and will never be done. Thus, Yasusada

      is one expression of this mourning: To use Robert Jay Lifton's

      phrase, he represents one possible form of the &quot;protean

      imagination&quot; that is required to move within something that

      is overwhelming and not fully negotiable through closures of

      identity and authority. There's no doubt there are other forms,

      more visionary than Yasusada's, on the verge of coming forth.
