      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">How long until we can just sit
      down<BR>
      &amp; write what we see? The children wait<BR>
      for their names to break like waves &amp; run screaming:<BR>
      <I>it's not so baaad</I> &shy; airplane strains for altitude<BR>
      the clouds above ocean's huddled mass<BR>
      the pelican endlessly scanning the thin veins<BR>
      of the surface, the surface, as if all were conspiring<BR>
      to keep it from us, the froth, Ur of the Chaldees,<BR>
      ancient cities unearthed<BR>
      by Disney &amp; Superior Branding. But there is<BR>
      a patience known only to shadows &amp; the pleasant ache<BR>
      of the lover. Who can say which way a shadow<BR>
      will fall, where the moon will rise on any<BR>
      given night, when the gravel will make friends<BR>
      with the sun, when this pulse will run<BR>
      from under your finger &amp; find<BR>
      its own point on the horizon<BR>
      to vanish.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The cartilage of the wave has
      its own<BR>
      principle, its own breaking point. And just<BR>
      where we snap the back of sail that visibly<BR>
      holds us together, moves forward is where<BR>
      the dead dog's eyes enter the equation, so<BR>
      beautiful like the unwrapping of a sandwich<BR>
      all wax paper anticipation. The loose chevron<BR>
      of the pelicans wobbles on the balance of<BR>
      breath we play with in each other, as lovers<BR>
      do, pinching it off, dabbling &amp; taking <BR>
      sips until slowly we get a taste of this<BR>
      limited offer: Eternity. Throw a ball<BR>
      on the beach &amp; watch it &quot;land&quot; at one of these<BR>
      conveniant locations. And do not get it back.<BR>
