          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We in the last quarter of 2001
          affirm the following guidelines for the publication of literature,
          patterned upon the manifesto of the Dogme95 filmmakers. The Dogme95
          Manifesto declared itself to be a &quot;VOW OF CHASTITY&quot;
          from the coercive representational techniques of mass-market
          cinema (sets, lighting, musical soundtracks, etc.); Dogma '01
          goes even further, rejecting the no less coercive marketing and
          distribution apparatus which Dogme95 filmmakers seem content
          to have deployed on their behalf. Dogma '01 rejects the division
          of labor between writer and publisher that prevails in the literary
          market-place, and therefore its productions are unfit for all
          but the most informal modes of distribution (barter, give-aways,
          and low-volume sales). These rules are to ensure that they remain
          so:</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">1. Dogma '01 is unalienated
          labor. Author and publisher will ideally be the same person.
          If not, they are to share the labor and cost of printing. Dogma
          '01 productions are to be assembled and bound by hand. No sending
          books out to be Docu-teched, and no perfect binding.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">2. The contents of Dogma '01
          books should be photocopied. Type may be set on a word processor
          or typewriter, but handwriting (the textual equivalent of the
          hand-held camera mandated by Dogme95) is best. No technique of
          reproduction is definitively barred, but those methods and materials
          most widely available to the general public are preferred. What
          in the world of fine printing are considered defects, Dogma '01
          views as beauty marks: staples, thumbprints, &quot;binder's creep,&quot;
          etc.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">3. The one-of-a-kind is hateful.
          Editions should be as large as humanly possible, unsigned, and
          un-numbered (except perhaps to compensate for the flaws of &quot;first
          fruits&quot; rush-jobbed in time for a reading). Scarcity should
          never be exploited to drive up exchange value. At such time as
          an author's Dogma '01 publication turns out to be a valuable
          commodity (i.e., quickly reselling for inflated amounts soon
          after issue), that author is obliged to produce ever-larger editions
          to compensate. Should demand exceed the author's production capacity,
          that author is obliged to withdraw from Dogma '01 and either
          go with a mainstream publisher, or become one. This is the only
          excuse for going with or becoming a mainstream publisher.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">4. Publishing in journals is
          kind of a gray area, on which we do not care to pronounce. Without
          it, Dogma '01 would risk becoming a solipsistic enterprise, with
          a readership as tightly circumscribed as that of any corporation's
          report to its shareholders. On the other hand, the wider an author's
          public, the harder it will be for that author to remain within
          the bounds of Dogma '01. The same goes for anthologies. Nor have
          we come to grips with the question of later reprints of Dogma
          '01 productions. Entering contests is fine, unless you win one.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">5. Dogma '01 is not a bid for
          elite/outsider status, but the affirmation of a literary and
          artistic sphere of exchange unmediated by the apparatuses of
          market capitalism. (Except does the post office count?) Authors
          need not lose money to qualify, though they assuredly will. Dogma
          '01 authors are to maintain cordial and friendly relationships
          with mere writers. No Dogma '01 clubs or juries are to be formed,
          and no one whose work meets these Dogma '01 criteria is barred.
          You will know it when you see it.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dogma '01 is no guarantee of
          quality. Without going so far as to abolish the category of &quot;artistic
          merit,&quot; it is our stance that 1) the above criteria are
          more important at the present moment in the history of writing,
          and that 2) they lead to better work anyway &shy; aesthetically
          as much as ethically speaking.<BR>
<BR>
          Please note that the above rules cannot be bent to include unqualified
          authors whose company and fellowship we may covet. For example,
          the book &quot;Scram #2&quot; by Mark Gonzales and Cameron Jamie
          with Raymond Pettibon &shy; photocopied in a signed and numbered
          edition of ten and sold for fifty dollars apiece last year at
          a gallery in Hollywood &shy; cannot be claimed as a Dogma '01
          production. (Too bad, because it's the summit of the half-sized
          booklet form.) It will also be noted that Dogma '01 is hard for
          novelists and writers in non-fiction genres, though we would
          be delighted to see someone try.<BR>
<BR>
          You are invited to reproduce and disseminate this manifesto freely.
          We will not rest until the earth is encased in a rustling jacket
          of paper. Oh wait, that's already happened.</FONT></P>
