      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Something so funny happened
      yesterday that I felt I had to share it with u.<BR>
      What started it, I guess was ab's laughter. He laughed and I
      said, hey I heard that<BR>
      before. Even as ab kept laughing, I began to think hard, now
      where did I hear that<BR>
      laugh?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"><BR>
      After a long time, when it still did not flash upon me, I started
      thinking of all my friends<BR>
      and recalling whether they laughed like that. One by one, they
      flashed by, my friends,<BR>
      finally I thought of u mark, and u know what, I just couldn't
      remember how u laughed. So<BR>
      weird, then I began to recall how u talked and even that did
      not register, shit, then I got<BR>
      paranoid and began to remember what u looked like and u know
      what mark, I've<BR>
      forgotten that as well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"><BR>
      And to think of it, just nine months ago we were walking hand
      in hand and dreaming of a<BR>
      future, we held hands for so long that they got sticky and we
      had to pull them apart.</FONT></P>
