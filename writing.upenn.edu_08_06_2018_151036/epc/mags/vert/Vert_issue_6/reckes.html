        a BA from Penn State and has since been working part-time jobs
        while he writes and tries to find a full-time job that isn't
        too horrible. He has also dedicated a recent nine weeks to wandering
        aimlessly around the country &quot;freeloading&quot; off people.</FONT></P>
