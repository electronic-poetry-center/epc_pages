      Three men floating down the river and a questionable dog<BR>

      Babel of course is Bible.</FONT></P>

      this bell time <BR>
      on times again</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the Bible (the Lie Bell)<BR>

      Turn inside out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Blake called this the diabolic

      reading, kindergarten of the gods,<BR>
      look up and hold the<BR>
      book like a picture above your head</FONT></P>

      A book is a mirror, a book<BR>
      is a mirror, all a book<BR>
      can be is mirror,<BR>
      a book's a shiny <BR>
      backwards thing,<BR>
      turn mirror round, turn it down,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Bible is biblion is the Book,<BR>
      the lion's bib<BR>
      we are the people <BR>
      eaten by a book.</FONT></P>

      Thus: before our celebrated human Saussure-exercise on the Plain
      of<BR>
      Shinar there was nothing but the bewildered silence of the natural
      world.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If we built, we built like beavers,
      silent and without discussion, glossy,<BR>
      beautiful, hopeless, wet.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel gave us language. The
      story tells not of the confusion of tongues<BR>
      but of the suspension of silence. Gift of tongues. In Babel for
      the<BR>
      first time we learned to speak.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">By speaking we conquered heaven.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This is heaven. Pure view. There
      is nothing but where we are.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Of course that sudden - but
      everlasting - mediation by language of primal<BR>
      presence is seen by some as a tragedy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Yet it is not the tragedy of
      incomprehension. It is the tragedy of too<BR>
      many meanings to fit a single Absence.</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">9.<BR>
      any book is bible, the bunch of signs<BR>
      your heart on my sleeve.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">10.<BR>
      Language is the body's answer to the mind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And Babel wants you. (Waits
      you.) It is your taste in my mouth (you<BR>
      decided to give me). A taste left after kissing, who would kiss
      me, I<BR>
      live alone, not a kiss, no more kisses, what is all this stuff
      about<BR>
      kisses, this is Babel, no kisses on the Plain of Shinar.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Each person kisses his own lips
      - isn't that what speech is?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's all language, baby bird,
      wombat on the porch, porcupines nibbling on<BR>
      the bark of the tree they're halfway up, a short salad, please,
      dear<BR>
      leaves, dear bark, halfway to heaven. We feed on what we travel,
      we feed<BR>
      on what lifts us. Kiss me. Stop talking about my mouth, this
      is no<BR>
      opera.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel taught (here's the simple
      version, by R.Simpleton, barely through<BR>
      with puberty - the last straw that breaks the back of childhood.
      The<BR>
      final humiliation is to want another person, to crave for what
      I loathe) -<BR>
      Babel taught (Rabbi Simpleton Roberto was trying to say),<BR>
      Babel taught us how to talk.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You said that. Over and over
      in fact. Language is always over and never<BR>
      over, always over and over and never done, language &quot;wants
      to go on,&quot; I<BR>
      have to keep telling you</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">the clear ever limpid meaningful
      and sweet palaver in the mother tongue<BR>
      terrible as troubadors. Language taught us how to crave.</FONT></P>
