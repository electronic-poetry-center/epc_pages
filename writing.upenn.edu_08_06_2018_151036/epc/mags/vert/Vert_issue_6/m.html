      I'm not thinking of much. I miss you. Because of <BR>
      some of the things I already wrote you. Somehow Robert I think
      of things <BR>
      about you and like I wrote you the last time. I'll write it this/that
      way of <BR>
      course. No course. Well I told it to dead and dead is dead. Even
      1954 knew <BR>
      that. Gone a lover anything 1958 dead is dead. So to also dead
      is dead is <BR>
      some more problems and I feel better. But of course I don't know
      when till I <BR>
      see you again or even know what friend I have some day one day.
      I was only <BR>
      on the second half of my twenties and now a 48 years off. I still
      did not <BR>
      touch any one sex since that highway road off the state.</FONT></P>
