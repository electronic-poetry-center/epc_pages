    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Let P be a set of n points in
    the plane &quot;booby.&quot; Give a time algorithm to find for
    each point p in P another point that is closest to the booby.
    2. The Gabriel Graph, GG, of a set S in E2 is defined as follows:
    let the pooty of disk (pi , pj ) be the circle having as a diameter;
    the Gabriel Graph of S has an edge between booby pi and booby
    pj in S if and only if disk (pi , pj ) contains no point of S
    in its interior. Show that booby pi and pj have an edge in GG
    if and only if this edge both appears in the Delaunay triangulation
    of S and crosses its dual Voronoi edge near the pooty. Use this
    to show that the Gabriel graph for any set S can be constructed
    in time, and also show the optimality of your pooty algorithm.
    Give an example of a set S for which the Gabriel Graph and the
    Delaunay triangulation are NOT the same. 3. In the Euclidean
    space Ed of coordinates x1 , x2, ... xd, for any real number
    p such that, the Lp-distance of two points q1 and q2 is given
    by the norm dp ( q1 , q2 ) = (SUM from j=1 to j=d of (| xj (
    q1 ) - xj ( q2 ) |)p )^ 1/p . (a) In the plane, characterize
    the Voronoi pooty diagram of a set of N points in the L1-metric.
    (b) Solve the same problem for the BOOBY-metric.  (c) What is
    the relationship between the Vorononi booby diagram in the L1-metric
    of pooty and that in the pooty-metric? [HINT: Draw a set of 4-5
    points on integer booby grid points and work out this small sample
    before trying to generalize.] ()<BR>
