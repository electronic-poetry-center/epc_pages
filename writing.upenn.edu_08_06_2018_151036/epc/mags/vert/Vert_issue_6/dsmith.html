        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Right now, I'm depraving
        myself as much as I can. Why? I want to be a poet, and I am working
        at making myself a </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">visionary:
        <I>you won't understand at all, and I'm not even sure I can explain
        it to you. The problem is to attain the unknown by disorganizing
        </I>all the senses. <I>The suffering is immense, but you have
        to be strong, and to have been born a poet. And I have realized
        that I am a poet. It's not my doing at all. <BR>
        </I>(Arthur Rimbaud to Georges Izambard, May 13, 1871)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I was just another suburban
        fuck-up, sans genius, mired in self-delusion. Unlike Arthur Rimbaud,
        my ruling daemon lacked focus and brilliance. I knew nothing
        about the young French poet who wanted &quot;to attain the unknown
        by disorganizing <I>all the </I>senses.&quot; It tested my youth
        instead. I drank myself into the dark unknown each weekend, blackened
        my teeth in fights and pushed fate behind the wheel of a car.
        Maybe it's a typical suburban childhood by now, I don't know.
        No experience of my life has been more violent. What I remember
        was an immense confusion that only shifted when my senses were
        lit. I wanted to be drunk or high. I could think of no better
        way to live in my American loneliness.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's odd to think of that loneliness
        now, how far in myself I was centered in it, or that it was really
        a loneliness of the imagination. Only I didn't understand it
        as center or imagination. Moody, arrogant and reclusive I played
        an electric guitar, prayed to the gods of Rock-n-Roll to deliver
        me from the tedious death cult of the American middle class.
        So when I was 16 I turned to Rimbaud first for comfort, and then
        validation.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In him I found a comrade. Maybe
        I read his name in the pages of <I>Rolling Stone</I>, or perhaps
        his image in a mist of images struck my wandering and hungry
        eyes. I know only that his words carried the seeds of my first
        awakening. They strengthened my heart and embodied my chaotic
        emotions. By his first poem, a translation of Horace, I, who
        could translate nothing, crowned myself by authority of his genius
        and inspiration, poet.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">On weekends around this time
        I'd come home late with bottles of Chablis. Then I'd play music
        and write the struggling details of my own seasons. I filled
        the lined pages, becoming drunk as evening passed. First blue
        patches of dawn broke through branches at my window, my family
        sleeping, me drunk and alone lost in a kind of glowing stupor.
        Pages blurred, stained with wine and ink. A white light lit my
        head and I'd follow it into the bulb at my desk, and try to catch
        the meaning.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My imagination trapped me in
        myself. I didn't see it for the terrifying thing it really was,
        a power so magnificent it would take years to learn how to live
        in it without falling. In those days it forced on me a self-induced
        alienation. I sipped Chablis as my parents slept. I opened a
        window and gagged on cigarettes. But words came to me. They entered
        my pen at least, if not exactly my head. Pages filled with my
        scrawl. Versions and visions of my seasons, mostly in hell, training
        myself to acquire an evil so natural to the kid behind the fine
        English of Schmidt's translation. But I was good by nature and
        upbringing, bourgeoisie good. There were manners I observed and
        affectations I learned. But in my mind I practiced evil and romance.
        &quot;Black A, white E, Red I,&quot; he wrote in &quot;Vowels,&quot;
        &quot;green U, blue O-vowels, / Some day I will open your silent
        pregnancies: / A, black belt, hairy with bursting flies, / Bumbling
        and buzzing over stinking cruelties.&quot; He was far away, a
        voice from what seemed a truer place and time.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Eros guided my wandering attention,
        but nothing lasted. I wanted love, or thought I wanted it. Being
        in love and being drunk were enough for me. There's nothing like
        feeling alive in a dead place, the sensation of life a fine substitute
        for it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A young woman drew my attention.
        She moved in tight jeans partially hidden by a formless red smock
        that tied behind her waist. She sprayed perfume from tester bottles
        on the counter, mixing scents of sweet and spice depending on
        the mood of the evening. Silver shrimp-loop earrings attached
        with clinical care to her lobes. We worked nights together. After
        one Friday shift, as I put away the mop and dumped the grey contents
        of its bucket, she asked if I wanted a drink. She was a college
        freshman and I was still in high school. She had vodka and cranberry
        juice in her car. We drank it, went back to my house and fucked
        on the floor in my room in the dark. I played music so my folks
        wouldn't hear. It was dark and I wanted to see. I turned on the
        light. Drunken laughter and whispers accompanied our movements
        and autumn wind howled.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My father woke us. Embarrassed
        silence in the house. Stains on my clothes, cranberry red in
        the corners of our mouths. The rest of the day is a fog now.
        I kept to my room. Nothing about it was said again. I was embarrassed
        and my mother cried.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Jennifer, an angster my age
        also worked with me. She disapproved of Dawn and would taunt
        me for &quot;doing that preppy bitch.&quot; I was nervous around
        her. A long bleached strand of hair reached her chin. She stood
        out tall and skinny, dressed in thrift-store finds. What attracted
        me too were her records--exotic collections of Sun Ra, The Wailers,
        Steve Reich and Violent Femmes. We listened to Sibelius on a
        mattress in her room, tense with confused desire.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I remember once in a clich&eacute;
        of summer moonlight how we managed to lie close in damp grass,
        her baggy shorts an open gate. Cold beer, an urban skyline, moon
        and stars above moved with a regular rhythm, moonlight on white
        limestone and the wet smell of grass under our knees. I offered
        no response to her taunts. I was silent, discussion an awkward
        discomfort. Why submit to that? I didn't <I>not</I> like her.
        But I was piecing it together as I went along, a slow, inarticulate
        doofus.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">One night in late winter we
        gathered for cold beer under a black sky. Someone brought vodka,
        whisky, marijuana, speed. There were Jocks, Ropers, Druggies
        and Preps. My friends were nobodies, like me, but we moved between
        groups with relative ease. Music lifted thin sounds through fat
        car speakers into dumb night air. If it had been summer there
        would be boats, that sort of thing. But in winter we huddled
        with our clans, talking about the girls we wanted to fuck. I
        noticed Jennifer alone with someone, but her eyes kept catching
        mine. A fire burned on shore near the water. Boys and girls stood
        by, shotgunning Buds while others slipped off to piss or grope
        in the dark. We excused ourselves, and I slowly moved with Jennifer
        into the dark too. I'd left my clan behind to warm by the fire.
        She tugged my coat sleeve. &quot;Come here,&quot; she whispered,
        vodka on her breath. Her shirt was slightly open and her eyes
        shined drunk.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">She slurred her words, and I
        kissed her. My friends chuckled as I moved further away with
        her. She staggered, leaning on me for support. In the grass I
        kissed her again, then went through her shirt for her breasts.
        &quot;You really look good with her,&quot; she said. &quot;You're
        so cool.&quot; I ignored her words, opening her bra instead.
        She pulled away suddenly, the breath visible between us. She
        didn't say anything and walked a few feet from me, unbuttoned
        her jeans, squatted and pissed into the weeds. Then she laughed
        a little and pulled herself up on me. &quot;I wanna stand,&quot;
        she said, and we stood. She put her mouth on mine. I felt her
        ass but she stepped back, laughing. &quot;Can't do that <I>here,&quot;
        </I>she teased, and walked away toward the firelight and the
        tinny laughter of nameless others.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My friends were drinking gin,
        and they gave me some. The fire warmed us, and my face glowed
        in its heat. Later I looked for her again, going group to group.
        Thick-necked jocks stared me down, cool motherfuckers.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I remember as the gin burned
        up to my skull the drunken desire to find her again. Flames lifted
        out from orange coals against the vast black liquid calm of the
        lake. By the time I found her words slurred through me, my vision
        a blur. Someone was with her, their faces vague outlines in the
        laughter and voices falling behind vision's wavering field. She
        staggered away from me, the many voices trailing off behind us
        as I followed her to a car. She crawled in, locked the door,
        leaning her face against its cold window. I shouted to her through
        the glass but she slumped into sleep as a group came up behind
        me.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Who the fuck are you,
        her boyfriend?&quot; someone asked, in my face, threatening to
        download the privilege of his muscle onto my thin body. As I
        answered with a cool, clean Fuck You his fist rammed up hard
        on my mouth. I reached for his neck and pressed my thumbs into
        his throat. I wanted to choke the motherfucker. Others came onto
        me from the dark, then like light his fist went into my face
        again.</FONT></P>

        encrusted with blood. In the mirror my face was bruised, swollen
        and bloody, my front teeth loose. I stunk of booze. I remembered
        so little of what happened. My father asked me and I could not
        say a word, him sitting there looking at me in disbelief and
        sad confusion. His St. Augustine still held its green in the
        late winter yard. I can write that something was breaking in
        me, but you won't know what that meant to me because I can barely
        remember that myself. But imagine those moments when what you
        most love dissolves, and there are no gods in you. More difficult
        than living in a world of shits is realizing you may be one of
        them. If Rimbaud chose to be a poet, I had it pushed on me, because
        poetry was not my business. But it was the only place to turn,
        the only place where the imagination for me was free.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Aden<BR>
<BR>
        A black volcanic massif pushes into the blue grey waters of the
        Gulf of Aden. The ancient port lies on the southwest coast of
        Arabia by the mouth of the Red Sea, 100 miles east of the straits
        of Bab al-Mandab. It's located strategically on the trade route
        between India and Egypt, and a protecting mountain backdrop has
        provided sheltered anchorage since archaic times. The old city
        of Aden is situated in the crater of a dead volcano. An elaborate
        system of rainwater storage tanks, partly cut out of living rock,
        is the oldest evidence of human activity there.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Aden is believed to have been
        the main harbor of the pre-Islamic kingdom of Aswan, and after
        its annexation by the kingdom of Saba'a in the 5th century it
        continued to play an important role in connecting Africa with
        the gold and incense road of Arabia. The Aden peninsula is flanked
        to the east and west by large bays, and Crater, the oldest portion
        of the city, lies to the east. Off shore Sirah Island juts out
        of the water, its well-fortified, triangular rock boosting an
        ancient castle high above the harbor.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The Eastern Bay silted up before
        the British arrived in 1839, and in 1860 the old harbor was replaced.
        The Tawahi and Ma'alla city sections, built in European style
        under British rule, lie on the banks of Western Bay, separated
        from Crater by the mountain ridge of Shamsan (1,725 feet). Tunnels
        lead from Ma'alla to Gold Mohur, an area on the south side of
        the peninsula, now a beach resort for tourists.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Capital of the People's Democratic
        Republic of Yemen (PDRY) until reunification in 1990, Aden suffered
        during the civil war of 1994 when a cholera epidemic killed more
        residents than the fighting. The city was a British colony until
        1968 when the Marxist State of South Yemen formed. A brief but
        bloody civil war in 1986 left thousands dead and caused extensive
        damage.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I visited Tawahi in December
        1992 after a 10-hour cab ride from Sana'a. The group taxi stopped
        for lunch in a small mountain village where we also bought qat
        to chew on our journey south. Qat speeds up the circulatory and
        nervous systems and stimulates conversation. We smoked and drank
        Pepsi, fellow passengers insisting I see certain portions of
        their country. Most of them were dropped off at a point in the
        outer city, while I continued toward the harbor. A veiled woman
        sat in the front seat of the French wagon between the driver
        and me. She wet herself somewhere along the way, and the urine
        soaked into the seat. The driver was infuriated and began to
        curse her. I told him to cool it. Where else after all was she
        to go? He gave me a fuck you look and handed the woman her luggage.
        We both got back in the cab. He lit a cigarette.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When we arrived at the doors

        lived on a Peace Corps teacher's salary, and wasn't exactly loaded.
        I noticed in Aden that Yankee dollars were expected from me other
        places too. We haggled over the price and he complained about
        the woman pissing his seat and I realized I was the one to pay
        for that inconvenience. It had been my sympathetic intentions
        that intervened on his argument with her anyway. The son-of-a-bitch
        smiled his fuck you smile, language between us like some gummy
        wall. I put the money in his fist, defeated; he took my pack
        off his luggage rack.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Rimbaud lived in Aden from 1881
        to 1890, working for a coffee, gum and hide exporter named Pierre
        Bardey. He received three shillings a day plus room and board
        in exchange for managing the company's books. &quot;You can't
        imagine the place,&quot; he wrote in a letter dated 28 Sept.
        1885. &quot;Not a tree, even a withered one, not a sod of earth!
        Aden is the crater of an extinct volcano filled up with the sand
        of the sea. You see nothing but lava and sand everywhere which
        cannot possibly produce the slightest vegetation. It is surrounded
        by desert sands. Here the crater of our extinct volcano prevents
        the air from coming in, and we are roasted as if in a lime-kiln.&quot;</FONT></P>

        that after his first attempt to establish trade in Harar he returned
        to Aden, &quot;determined to throw up his appointment, and to
        look for more congenial work.&quot; But he continued in the services
        of Bardey, though at a higher rate.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;He remained at Aden toying,&quot;
        Starkie writes, &quot;in his unmethodical, eager and childish
        way, with various plans for improving his prospects. He tried
        to obtain a contract from the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie
        to write articles dealing with his travels in the province of
        Harar. He was the first European who had ever resided [there].
        He had, however, no influential support, no one to recommend
        him, and the lofty Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie
        was not interested in an obscure employee of a coffee exporter
        from Aden&quot; (356).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Clerks at the desk of The Rock
        demanded American dollars for rent of their moldy rooms. I had
        with me only a couple of 20s and a wad of Yemeni riyals and dinars.
        &quot;Look,&quot; I said, &quot;I've got money right here,&quot;
        and I pushed a mountain of riyals toward him. He looked upon
        the pink, green and grey bills with some disgust, then continued
        processing some non-work he had invented upon my entry. Exhausted
        from travel, and being a terrible bargainer to boot, I finally
        broke a twenty and rode the rickety elevator up to my room.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The Rock housed Yemen's only
        brewery, a reminder of British occupation and colonial acculturation
        to the inhospitable climate. I ordered one and it was served
        semi-cold in a pint-sized green bottle. The bar at the top of
        the hotel overlooked the harbor. Fishing boats and two US battleships
        anchored there near Sirah Island. Young German backpackers sat
        by a window, refreshing themselves on the local brew. Rats scurried
        for crumbs under a table on the mildewed carpet. I drank the
        beer, happy to have it and thankful it would bring me down from
        the strung-out, qat-inspired shock of travel.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Later I walked along the boardwalk
        in damp heat. The sun set with a pink film through grey haze.
        I ate fava beans in spicy tomato paste, dipping it with a hard
        French roll, waving off the many flies between bites. Sweat dripped
        from my waiter's face and made rings under his arms and on his
        chest. He only shrugged at my feeble Arabic. I was looking for
        Rimbaud's house I explained, but he didn't seem to know what
        I was talking about.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In the park children sold halwas
        and vendors hawked ice cream and french fried potatoes. Black
        mountains surrounded the city, holding heat in a mountainous
        oven. In other parts of the country I felt very comfortable,
        though here I noticed my alien presence, a stranger on the eve
        of war, the cause of which was none of my business. A month prior
        riots in most major cities were put down by the military. From
        my rooftop I watched helicopters circle downtown Hodeidah, black
        smoke from blazing tires thickening the air. Young men with rocket
        launchers and AK47s marched through schara Sana'a, posting checkpoints
        at major intersections and thoroughfares.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Rimbaud brought with him a woman
        from Harar, probably a slave, according to Starkie. &quot;He
        rented a house, although he himself had free lodging provided
        at Bardey's store, and he lived with her all the time that he
        remained in Aden&quot; (361).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Over time he slowly saved money,
        &quot;eating out his heart at Aden with frustration and disappointment.&quot;
        In a letter dated 5 May 1884 he writes: &quot;Excuse me for having
        given you these details of my worries, but I see that I am about
        to reach the age of thirty (half my life) and I am very tired
        of rolling around the world without any tangible result.&quot;</FONT></P>

        they thought I was going to stay there for the rest of my life
        just to please them. They did everything they could to get me
        to stay, but I told them to go to hell with their benefits and
        their business and their stinking company and their dirty town.</FONT></I></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Back at The Rock's lounge for
        a nightcap, lights in the harbor twinkled. A German schoolteacher
        sat at the bar beside me. He was on vacation, on his way to Sana'a
        next morning. The bartender eyed us suspiciously, while below
        us the city's light made silver ripples in the water. The German
        told me he thought Rimbaud's house was still standing, but he
        wasn't sure how to find it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">After King Menelek &quot;once
        more got the better of a foreigner,&quot; Rimbaud returned to
        Aden &quot;in a state of fatigue and dejection.&quot; His gun-running
        expedition to Shoa failed, and he was broke. &quot;My hair is
        quite grey,&quot; he wrote in a letter to his mother (23 Aug.
        1887) at the age of 33. &quot;It seems to me that my whole life
        is decaying. You have only got to imagine what one must be like
        after hardships such as these - crossing the sea in an open rowing
        boat, travelling for days on horseback without change of clothes,
        without food, without water. I'm terribly tired! I've no work
        and I'm terrified of losing the little money that I have.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In Shoa, negotiations over
        this caravan were carried out under disastrous circumstances:
        Menelik confiscated all the merchandise and forced me to sell
        everything to him at reduced prices, forbidding me to sell it
        at retail and threatening to send it all back to the coast at
        my expense! </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">(To the
        French Vice-Consul 30 July 1887).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He looked for work in Aden after
        this expedition into Abyssinia. He queried the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
        de G&eacute;ographie again, and considered working as a war correspondent
        for <I>Le Temps</I>, &quot;to report on the Italian war with
        Abyssinia&quot; (379). But gun-running was the only real source
        of income for him by this point, and &quot;as a result of the
        new arms agreement which had been signed by England and France,
        the price for which rifles could be sold to the Abyssinian kings
        might be considerably increased&quot; (381). After some difficulties
        he obtained a license for importing arms into the Kingdom of
        Shoa. It would prove to be another failed venture.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I slept that night in a sleeping
        bag spread over mildewed bedsheets. Next morning light came through
        thick mildewed curtains and the mildewed carpet on my bare feet
        was kind of disgusting. I took a French bath with cold water
        from a slow faucet. During my breakfast of beans and bread I
        thought of the rats from the previous nights, but the no star
        fare was fine. Back in my room I sat at the balcony, sipping
        hot tea. Boys walked the street gathering bottles; trucks buzzed
        by releasing a thick stream of black smog; people passed, going
        their way to work or to the open air suqs. Ships in the harbor
        remained anchored, though rumors of a bombing at a hotel frequented
        by American sailors was on everyone's lips.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It was calm on the street and
        I found a park bench shaded by a palm. A young man asked if he
        could sit next to me. He was a student of English and welcomed
        an opportunity to speak the language. He took me to Bardey's
        store, and then we walked through the park toward the water.
        Crowds of men were out now, and we moved through a small suq:
        spices, candy, qat, clothing and other merchandise were arranged
        in neat areas, merchants talking quietly with customers. A cloth
        was spread and around it several men squatted, picking food from
        it, a goat bahhing near by.</FONT></P>

        and hoisted to the ceiling so that he could make no movement,&quot;
        hoping that it would somehow heal. It was removed later at Marseilles.

        At first he talked about cutting the leg off; then he decided
        to wait a few days to see if the swelling, with medical treatment,
        would diminish at all. I look like a skeleton; I scare people.
        My back is raw from the bed, I can't get a minute's sleep. I
