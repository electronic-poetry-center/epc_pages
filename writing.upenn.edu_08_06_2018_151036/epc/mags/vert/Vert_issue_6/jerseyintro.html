      INTRODUCTION: JERSEY PHANTOMS</FONT></B></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">by Jeffrey
      Jullich</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In 1852, fleeing from a warrant
      for his arrest and the political revenge of Prince Louis Napoleon
      (whose presidency he had supported), Victor Hugo, author of <I>The
      Hunchback of Notre Dame </I>and <I>Les Mis&eacute;rables</I>,<I>
      </I>went into exile on the sea-beaten island of Jersey.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">His family's half of the house
      at No. 3 Marine Terrace, fully furnished but without linen, and
      rented from a friend of the painter J.M.W. Turner, was soon filled
      with Madame Hugo and their adult children: daughter Ad&egrave;le,
      and sons Charles and Francois-Victor, a translator of Shakespeare;
      and chambermaid Fanny, servants Marie and Julie, and Catherine
      the cook who was dismissed for stealing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(Briefly, they were joined by
      the Vaudeville actress Anais Lievenne --- a lover of Alexandre
      Dumas' who resembled his Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias. Francois-Victor
      had been borrowing money to support Anais in Paris at 500 francs
      a month, a third of the rent for their half of No. 3 Marine Terrace.
      She suffered from fainting fits and suicide attempts.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hugo described No. 3 Marine Terrace
      as &quot;a hut&quot;, &quot;a shed&quot;, &quot;a heavy white
      cube shaped like a tomb the smallness of the windows aggravated
      the crepuscular sadness of the house.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Table-tapping and ouija boards
      were the rage. On September 11th, 1853, into the intellectual
      sterility of Jersey, the visiting Mme. de Girardin, author of
      <I>Lady Tartuffe </I>and <I>Happiness scares me </I>(<I>La Joie
      fait peur</I>), introduced the Hugos to a small circular table
      on top of a large square one.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One tap for A, two for B, three
      for C, etc. --- &quot;Each letter would have taken, on average,
      about five seconds to tap out, and it could take two hours just
      to compose a short paragraph&quot; (Stephens, p. 34) --- the
      table terrified everyone present: what they took to be the spirit
      of the drowned L&eacute;opoldine Hugo. Over 100 seances were
      recorded in a notebook. The spirit guests included Dante, Racine,
      Mohammed, Hannibal, the Lion of Androcles, etc., and the Shakespeare
      and Aeschylus here translated; but, gradually, the literary immortals
      gave way to fragmented characters such as Cedj, a headless man,
      patricides, druidesses, and others.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A baker's boy walking near St.
      Luke's church on Marine Terrace saw a motionless white figure
      in flames. Hugo began hearing strange tappings in the walls;
      his manuscripts moved about. Charles and Francois-Victor returning
      home late saw the windows emblazoned as if with candelabra and
      a roaring fireplace. By table-tapping, a 3 a.m. meeting was arranged
      with the White Lady the barber had seen. Front door bells were
      heard ringing at night when no one was there. Hugo soon was composing
      verse outdoors at night near the island's indigenous cromlechs,
      menhirs, and dolmens.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Finally, a friend, Jule Allix,
      went mad during a s&eacute;ance: he sat on the Hugos' blue sofa
      without moving for four hours, and was later found prone trying
      to magnetize his watch to stop at midnight.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By process of elimination, it
      can be reconstructed who the medium of the most eloquent Jersey
      Phantoms must have been, capable of table-tapping <I>ex tempore
      </I>1 &shy; 26 = A &shy; Z perfect rhymed alexandrines: Charles
      Hugo. When he was not at the table, the s&eacute;ance was a shambles
      of alphabet soup.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A certain Oedipal poignance informs
      the scenario: son of the great poet and author, brother of the
      translator of Shakespeare, Charles Hugo's only known poetry was
      transcribed under dozens of <I>others</I>' names, names of the
      deceased or the never fully living, written by visitors from
      the beyond.</FONT></P>
