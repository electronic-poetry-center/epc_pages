         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> It's said that Gabriel Gudding is a
        very funny poet. I have a question first for you, Gabe, and then
        one for Mairead: Gabe, do you think you are a funny poet?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Gabriel Gudding:</FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> It's like asking if I think myself
        handsome or well endowed. Or if I share the opinion that I have
        penetrating green eyes. Superego's answer: not for me to judge.
        Id's answer: of course you are being an agent provocateur here.
        Ego's answer: This question is really unfair. If I write something
        and then read it out loud, people sometimes laugh. That's nice,
        bully for them, big deal. Look, your question is a very common
        challenge. It's a challenge peculiar not only to comic writers
        but to anyone outside the dominant mode: you don't get, for instance,
        people walking up to, I don't know, Louise Gluck, saying, &quot;Professor
        Gluck, Sir, do you think you're a poignant poet?&quot; And there's
        a reason for this. Decorous poetry, or &quot;grief-work&quot;
        poetry, or dignified poetry is what we <B>expect</B> from a poet.
        I.A. Richards noted, most effectively in Practical Criticism,
        that certain audiences have certain &quot;stock responses.&quot;
        And here the social is tied, as Bakhtin noted, to the aesthetic
        realm. Most audiences demand from poetry dignified emotions,
        the high and the noble, poignant, the elegiac and nostalgic,
        dignified desire and dignifying despair, contrition or well-turned
        shame, these things constitute the dimensions of stock response
        in Euro-American poetry culture. Anything that falls outside
        that narrow emotional register, we tend to call &quot;shocking&quot;
        or &quot;funny.&quot;</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> You can't be serious! Expectations
        of a high and noble tone may have been the hegemonic stock response
        in Euro-American poetry culture in 1892, but half the poets in
        today's America are test-tube babies conceived of Gertrude Stein's
        eggs and Frank O'Hara's jism. Why are you being so defensive?</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The act of asking someone whether she
        is a funny poet is -- to my paranoid mind -- an act of policing.
        But I know you are ironical, otherwise I would do violence or
        get high-minded and quote Foucault, after he was asked whether
        he would call himself &quot;gay&quot;: &quot;Do not ask me who
        I am and do not demand that I remain the same. Leave it to the
        police and bureaucrats to make sure our papers are in order.&quot;
        I notice, for instance, that you do not ask if I write funny
        poetry. You ask, rather, whether I am a funny poet. You ask about
        my identity rather than the rhetoric of my poetry. And this is
        commonly done to poets. In fact, this is commonly done to anyone
        who needs to be disciplined. And poetry is a language that needs
        to be disciplined (the foregoing word is a verb, not an adjective,
        by the way). It is in fact the most disciplined discourse in
        the literary scene. In the dominant tradition, the lyric tradition,
        poets are identities first, and are considered monologists: they
        hold the stage and their work is, essentially, an exercise of
        the lyric self in a lonely display of emotion, emotions unmediated
        by social relations. Deep down you are afraid of me, otherwise
        you would not police me in this manner, Kent Johnson.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">GG: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In fact, poetry is a rhetoric. Yet poets
        make claims for its vatic status all the time: Henry Gould claiming
        poetry is &quot;deep calling unto deep,&quot; and he resorts
        to the example of literary figures, such as Mandelstam, rather
        than to individual poems, or Alan Dugan saying it's this voice
        he's heard in his head since he was 16, or Emerson declaring
        that the poet simply tries to write down what is already there,
        as if he were just recording it. This reclamation of the vatic
        is a way of conferring authenticity on the *poet. It avoids discussion
        of the social and political uses of poetry; we would rather see
        Mandelstam or Whitman as vatic identities rather than political
        writers. It is interesting that poets of witness are policed
        for their identities first. Writers who engage politically, as
        comic poets necessarily do (even if simply through an engagement
        with the politics of aesthetics) and as the poets of witness
        do, are policed first by their identities -- which to me is the
        wonderful thing about the Yasusada corpus. Someone like Reznikoff
        is interesting to me because his objectivist courtroom political
        poems, which Mairead brought to my attention, are so powerful
        and yet he is considered a person of relatively low charisma.
        He is not attacked, really, for his identity because he is writing
        from an appropriate and fairly non-contentious social position:
        if his poems however had been published in a post WW2 victorious
        Germany, say, his identity and social position would matter a
        great deal, despite the fact that his poems are not invested
        with the typical rhetorical devices demanded by stock response.
        I mean look at the issue of gender among great political poets.
        Amiri Baraka has his whole life's affiliations and identities
        mapped out chronologically in The Baraka Reader (the Black Nationalist
        period, etc etc [must find my Baraka reader]) because he is in
        a contentious relationship with the predominantly white male
        poetry establishment. I think it's interesting that great political
        poets who happen to be minority women, such as Lucille Clifton
        or Gwendolyn Brooks, do not have their identities policed as
        strongly as a minority poet on the opposite side of the gender
        divide. They are mistakenly believed, by people who do not read
        their poetry, to occupy a less threatening political position.
        The same is true of &quot;comic poets&quot;: when most people
        think of contemporary comic poets they think of Edson, Tate,
        Knott, Dugan, Collins. When in fact the greatest comic writers
        today are, in my estimation, women, by dint not only of their
        political position in a patriarchal world, but their rhetorical
        genius and inventiveness: Linda Smukler, Barbara Barg, Wanda
        Coleman, Terri Ford, Mildred Tremblay, Rachel Loden, Denise Duhamel,
        Lynn Emanuel, Bernadette Mayer, Caroline Knox, Maxine Chernoff,
        Sharon Olds, and, of course Mairead Byrne. Louise Gluck, by the
        way, has written some hilarious work.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">That's fascinating. And I'm glad I asked
        the question the way I did. So now, Mairead, do <I>you</I> think
        Gabe is a funny poet?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Mairead Byrne:
        </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I love hearing Gabe read
        and watching the expressions on people's faces as it dawns on
        them that these poems are funny. There is a raptness, an attention,
        almost a pricking of the ears, a beautiful mix of expressions
        from bemused concentration to borderline delight. Then a brave
        someone breaks the tension and laughs. Yes, there is always laughter.
        I have to say though that Gabe takes his fun very seriously.
        If you hurled it, it would have the approximate weight of an
        antique printing press. But Kent, I must ask you: why does your
        question remind me of the old joke: &quot;Well enough about Gabe,
        let's talk about you, Mairead - what do <I>you</I> think of Gabe?&quot;
        I hope you will answer my question.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You know what Virginia Woolf said about
        that word. But I'd like to enter the conversation by engaging
        with the issue of identity raised by Gabe. Lucille Clifton and
        Gwendolyn Brooks may be less disciplined by their identities
        as Black, as women, or as lesbian, than Baraka is, but only in
        the fundamental sense that women's identities are conventionally
        blurry in public arenas. The &quot;predominantly white male poetry
        establishment,&quot; as Gabe terms it, may be less interested
        in Clifton and Brooks, and therefore less likely to engage in
        discourse, or combat, with them. But there are other arenas.
        The &quot;predominantly white male poetry establishment&quot;
        does not represent &quot;most people.&quot; In the classroom
        this semester, for example, I have seen students lock horns with
        Baraka, yes, but also with Clifton and Brooks. Baraka's &quot;When
        We'll Worship Jesus,&quot; Brooks' &quot;The Mother,&quot; and
        Clifton's &quot;poem to my uterus&quot; are shocking to students
        in surprisingly similar ways. Neither Jesus nor ovaries should
        be mentioned in poems, either for attack or celebratory purposes.
        I'm convinced if we pursue this line of thinking far enough,
        &quot;Jesus&quot; will eventually become &quot;ovaries,&quot;
        in any case. &quot;Most people&quot; is as likely to mean &quot;myself
        in a less enlightened incarnation&quot; as it is to mean the
        &quot;predominantly white male poetry establishment,&quot; or
        indeed most people. I don't for a second think that the name
        Alan Dugan springs to mind when most people think of contemporary
        comic poetry. Shel Silverstein or Dr. Seuss would be more likely.
        Most people don't hook &quot;contemporary&quot; to &quot;poetry&quot;
        at all. Rachel Loden sent me the sales figures, from the New
        York Times, for Alan Dugan's hopefully inaccurately titled Poems
        Seven: New and Complete Poetry.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The bumper crop for the week

        in the children's book category sold roughly half again as many
        copies in the same period (470), the non-fiction winner sold
        about 14-15 times as many (4,900), and in any ONE of these four
        weeks, the fiction winner sold about a hundred times as many
        copies as the Dugan book did in the four weeks total.&quot; That's
        bad - but on the other hand, I'd like to know those 340 people
        who bought Dugan's book in those four weeks, and in fact I probably
        do. The poetry community in America is tiny and that's great:
        never underestimate the capacity of tiny things to change.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What, even if you're as tiny audience-wise
        as Reznikoff?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">MB: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Charles Reznikoff's audience was and
        still is even tinier than Dugan's. Black Sparrow, that champion
        press, sold an average of 85 copies of Holocaust per year in
        the 20 years of its availability. An average of 119 copies per
        year of Testimony were sold, 1978-2000. During his lifetime,
        Reznikoff never proved attachable to the centers of power offered
        by the poetry world. He is considered to be one of the Objectivists,
        but that identity is more salient now than then. He was Jewish
        and his work engages intensively with Jewishness, that may also
        be a factor. The work of this man, so little known, communicates
        with students in a way no other poet I have ever taught does.
        I wanted to include Testimony or Holocaust in a lecture course
        for 120 students I am doing this semester but Holocaust has been
        out of print since 1995. I'm hoping Black Sparrow will reprint
        it in 2002. Reznikoff published and distributed his books himself;
        it is wonderful to come across them in a library such as Cornell,
        to which he sent each as it was published. If you and Gabe would
        like to be the Ginsberg and Kerouac of this interview, I'd be
        honored to be the Charles Reznikoff.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Mairead, I was merely trying to get
        the light and easy questions out of the way But since you seem
        intent on getting to the meat of the interview, well, OK, I'll
        go ahead and ask you one now that I was saving for later: <I>Is
        TRUTH the aim of your poetry?</I> And also, do you find it at
        all funny that a well-regarded younger poet of Ireland has ended
        up living in Mississippi, where there are (or so I have read)
        more chickens as pets per household than anywhere else in the
        country?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">MB:</FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Truth is not the aim of my poetry,
        though a certain type of accuracy has always been important to
        me. I have a background in journalism, in common with Reznikoff.
        He was trained as a journalist and didn't work as one. I worked
        as a journalist but wasn't trained as one. My idea of accuracy
        involved referring to the Irish Sea, between Ireland and England,
        as the Irish Ocean. Sub-editors didn't like that sort of thing.
        But for me it was more tactful and economical than going into
        the colossal differences which seemed to separate Irish and English
        culture at the time. Many elements of my aesthetic come from
        journalism: the accuracy, tact, and economy which I have mentioned;
        also an affiliation to the articulacy of structure. Why spell
        something out if the composition of the piece, its structure,
        order, shape, position on the page, etc, can carry the bulk of
        the &quot;telling&quot;? Juxtaposition was my major strategy
        as a journalist; I also used parody a lot. I have a long time
        interest in the found poem - Reznikoff, of course, is the master
        of the proliferating, systematized found poem. I sometimes removed
        all visible traces of myself from interviews - Studs Terkel was
        also an influence - just as Reznikoff does in Holocaust and Testimony;
        but like Reznikoff, I scored and arranged the pieces. Much more
        than I have been able to achieve, he deals in silence, in the
        tact of not speaking. I like my found poems because they are
        completely cold as far as my presence is concerned. This aesthetic
        is my souvenir of reticence. My poems can also be quite voluble,
        even ecstatic. But I remember, before I left Ireland, a poet
        called Joan McBreen said to me, &quot;Your poems are not lyrical.&quot;
        I was surprised but it seemed true. In the context of Irish poetry
        it was sort of like hearing, &quot;Your poems are not poems.&quot;
        It was time to go.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, that's interesting, because you
        published a couple years back a gorgeous little book called The
        Pillar, and there are certainly lyrical moments of luminous order
        therein. Or, say, the amazing poem entitled &quot;Grooming,&quot;
        whose occasion is a frankly somatic hairiness, but out of which
        you comb a language something akin to A Child's Christmas in
        Wales. And what about this piece by you, one I just love, which
        is lyrical in pretending to not be lyrical, a little &quot;Jubilate
        Agno&quot; to your Cat Gabriel, as I take it. What I like so
        much about your poetry is the relaxed, almost off-handed mixing
        of the lyric and the ironic, the weave of them; sometimes that
        mixing makes things funny, and sometimes it makes things moving.
        And it seems to me that this is very different from the great
        bulk of &quot;experimental&quot; writing today, whose penchant
        is for the intellectually hyper-earnest and emotionally hyper-chaste.
        Are you sure you are a &quot;not lyrical&quot; poet? Well, here's
        that poem:</FONT></P>

        hear a very sad voice attempting to articulate a relationship
        but failing miserably because of rhetorical limitations. It's
        a type of love poem from a student to a teacher, one which is
        amply marked by what David Lloyd calls &quot;the unexpungeable

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> In Mississippi, as you put it, there
        are chickens in the parlor instead of Irish-speaking pigs. Sometimes
        they stand out beside the red wheelbarrows. In order for a chicken
        to pass from the parlor to the yard in Mississippi, it must file
        many applications, pay a fee, canoodle with the right folks,
        and get its permit stamped in three different colors of invisible
        ink. And yet one can never say the word &quot;chicken&quot; out
        loud. As Alan Dugan says, &quot;You just shouldn't mention her
        name.&quot; It sure is funny to have ended up, if I am up-ended,
        in Mississippi a couple of hundred yards down the road from the
        grave of William Faulkner. When I was first invited here, I was
        wildly excited: it seemed the most glamorous place in the world.
        But then I hadn't left our apartment for a while. It's a riveting
        place, most unlike anywhere I've been in America. It's consumed
        and tortured by history and questions of identity. If I ever
        had to leave the South, I'd be very sad to be stepping away from
        this African-American America. At the same time, I was handed
        an ID card stamped &quot;Outsider&quot; when I crossed the state
        line. Furthermore, I'm nowhere sweet enough for the South. In
        Ireland it's considered the epitome of tact to lacerate oneself
        mercilessly and to excoriate those one respects and loves. Not
        in Mississippi though. I now have to go to some orthodontist
        of the soul who will wire a smile into my face. But I'm still
        Irish enough to say, &quot;Well- regarded -- who? Younger --
        who? Are you getting at me?&quot; But how about you, Kent? How
        are your dealings with folks? Do you pay dues at charm school

        about butts, sexual organs, scatological matter, Language poets,
        and many other <I>cabinet of wonders</I>-like objects. In my
        estimation you are as funny as, or funnier than, all the male
        poets you mention above (especially Billy Collins!), and, believe
        me, much brainier and less predictable, though you don't mention
        Koch, who is the greatest. But your startling, ranting outburst
        in defense of the comical leads me to ask, and please don't take
        this in any sort of personal way: Do you think the responsibility
        of the &quot;comic poet&quot;-- or of poets who tend to write
        comical poems-- has changed in the wake of September 11? Is there
        still a place in the culture for sense- deranging poems about
        the arses of peacocks? As I said, this is a very serious and,
        I think, worthwhile question. And Mairead, if you could follow
        up Gabe's answer: Since everyone is talking about how everything
        has changed so deeply, can you talk in a more global sense about
        how you see the world's frightening new situation affecting poetry's
        function, meaning, direction, or whatever the right abstract
        noun would be.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Interesting you should mention the poem
        &quot;On the Rectum of Peacocks.&quot; Paul Gallo, a conservative
        radio talk show host with Supertalk Mississippi (a station, I'm
        told, funded by Trent Lott) invited me on the air three times
        during fall semester of 2001 in order to excoriate me for teaching
        smut to U Miss undergrads, and at one point Mr. Gallo read that
        poem aloud -- to 40 of 80 counties in the state of Mississippi
        -- as evidence of my depravity. Mr. Gallo was apparently incensed
        that I was teaching blue material to students of my comedy course.
        He, in his words, had &quot;done some research&quot; on me and
        had discovered the poems that Jack Kimball and Mark DuCharme
        had included in their &quot;Funny Business&quot; issue at The
        East Village (www.theeastvillage.com). The course in question
        was one on the theories and varieties of comedy, and a great
        deal of the course material were poems that broach taboo subjects
        -- you know, like race, sexuality, and violence. Mr. Gallo wanted
        to know what the heck I was up to. At one point on the last show,
        he called me a &quot;racist&quot; because I refer to a fish in
        the poem as an Italian. (Mr. Gallo's last name is Gallo, after
        all). He read the poem poorly, what's more, but it was probably
        the widest audience I've ever had for a reading. I got great
        pleasure out of his reading that poem, I have to say, because
        I knew that Gallo could not make head or tail out of it, that
        he hated the poem, and that, best of all, Gallo's producer could
        be heard in the background laughing to my poem! Gallo was reading
        the poem in disbelief because it was tasteless and senseless,
        ostensibly, and his own producer was enjoying the poem! *That,
        for me, is the power of, as you say, &quot;deranging&quot; art:
        people laugh and look despite themselves, and in so doing learn
        a little more about who they are, *what they are. So, you ask:
        is there a place for it now? I dunno Kent, comic poetry, or deranging
        poetry, as you call it (a term I like) is, I imagine, at its
        best precisely when there IS no place for it -- isn't it? A poem
        such as Auden's &quot;September 1,1939,&quot; perhaps the most
        widely circulated poem on listserves after 9.11, in many ways
        speaks for a group: it expresses a wide-ranging sentiment. Deranging
        or comic poems, as opposed to poems of a decorous nature, stuff
        like valor or grief, are often critical of a group, registering
        some substantial dissent with the status quo or mainstream sentiment.
        Comedy is something for dissidents. It attacks propriety. And
        that's something that Paul Gallo couldn't understand: how can
        literature be improper? &quot;On The Rectum of Peacocks,&quot;
        is about, I suppose, the backside of beauty, and it reflects,
        I guess, the idea that talent is an essentialized construction
        conferred on those who write according to the rules of aesthetic
        and social propriety. It is improper literature attacking proper
        ideals.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">So tragedy demands impropriety?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What I'm saying is that a time
        without impropriety is dangerous, and a dearth of impropriety
        should especially be feared in a time of nationalism and &quot;war&quot;
        (which by the way this is not: this is a time of American bombing,
        not war). Dearth: after 9.11 Ben Stiller cancelled his guest
        appearance on SNL, the comic strip &quot;Boondocks&quot; was
        suspended for a while, and the <I>The New Yorker</I> declined
        to run cartoons in its first issue in the aftermath of 9.11.
        A typical idea about comedy is that it's frivolous escapist cast-off
        literary chaff, that it does no cultural work and bears no meaning
        -- or at least that's what freshmen in my comedy classes say
        during the first week of classes.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Please. Propriety resides in
        our courts, our police, and in our worst poets. The purpose of
        propriety is to stop revolution. Impropriety more now than ever
        is needed. What is more necessary in a time of military propaganda
        than the derision of consensus? Even if it is aesthetic consensus?
        Comedy fights all idealized conceptions of a group, and it certainly
        fights all idealized uses of emotion (poignancy). Poignancy is
        after all akin to nostalgia; nostalgia being a form of idealized
        memory: what we see in the propagandist efforts of America's
        major media is a turn toward poignancy (stories of 9.11 heroism,
        grief, loss) and away from comedy, a turn that perfectly parallels
        this community's efforts to manufacture consent in a time of
        military mobilization. American sentimentality, afterall, is
        one of the deadliest aesthetics on record. What do I mean by
        &quot;sentimentality&quot;? Well, for instance, I don't know
        how many times I've heard, as an American in America, the phrase,
        &quot;We will put this terrible tragedy behind us.&quot; In the
        days following 9.11, it was said dozens of times by everyone
        from Colin Powell to Bush Jr. to Governor Pataki of NY State
        and Mayor Giuliani. But I'd heard it dozens of times over the
        last few years anyway: when an &quot;honor student&quot; dies
        in a car wreck, a plane goes down, a bus slams a pole, we hear
        the words &quot;terrible tragedy&quot; and are encouraged to
        &quot;put it behind us.&quot; &quot;Tragedy&quot; is a concept
        has been cathected by the most sentimentalizing features of American
        culture. It's as if it's the only catchword, idea, or event that
        will allow us to form even the rudest conception of history as
        a community. As a result, American public displays of emotion
        are melodramatic, because they are serving a surrogate cultural
        function: they are not about emotion, but about our inability
        to comprehend our own brutal history: tears and sentimentality,
        in other words, seem to be the only cultural response Americans
        can muster in response to our own actions. We're essentially,
        that is to say, babies. On September 17th, Scott Segal of &quot;All
        Things Considered&quot; reported on impromptu street memorials
        in NYC near ground zero. One in particular caught my attention:
        Segal said it read, &quot;When we weep, we endure.&quot; I think
        this is interesting insofar as the comic view is exactly the
        opposite: comedy doesn't cause us to aspire to something lofty,
        and it doesn't mimic suffering; instead, comedy mimes durable
        beings engaged, often, in acts of misprision, folly, or emotional,
        spiritual, and physical destruction. The point of comedic art
        is that the writer can make us laugh at these things. Comedy,
        that is to say, does not teach us to suffer; it teaches us to
        endure. It shows us up as humble and profoundly resilient creatures.
        And I think that is the role of &quot;deranging&quot; poems in
        such a time: to remind us that we ought not consider our cause
        noble, just, good and honorable when we cannot help but laugh
        at butts, violence, vomit, and cussing.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">To be frank, I entered the classroom
        with a certain eagerness on September 12th, the day after the
        attacks. I felt, as a poetry teacher, I had a job to do: a necessary
        and valuable job. My students were very willing to sift through
        poems, selecting what would be immediately useful to them. We
        had just completed a unit on war poetry: poems which had perhaps
        seemed remote to them became incandescent. I was angry and disappointed
        any time classes were cancelled that week. On one occasion, I
        stood in a bleak crowd outside a church on campus, excluded,
        silenced, unable to hear what was going on, but standing with
        the others in a stiff attitude of servility and attendance. That
        was hopeless, and nothing like the lambent, courageous words
        of ee cummings, Muriel Rukeyser, Genevieve Taggard, Nelly Sachs,
        and Reznikoff. I was also happy that at the moment the planes
        hit I was writing poetry. I was in bed writing a poem called
        &quot;Looking for the Burning Bush&quot; on my laptop. When my
        working time was over, I went into the study where Gabe was and
        he said, &quot;Hey, two planes have crashed into the World Trade
        Center and another into the Pentagon.&quot; We followed events
        as best we could on our computers, we don't have a TV. Listservs
        proved to be prime providers of information, as well as intense
        and powerful communities, in the days that followed. There is
        plenty of reason for self-hatred in relation to our puniness
        and marginality. But poetry was not something to be contemptuous
        about at that time. One other thing: my student Zhanna Koushhova,
        who is from Kabardino-Balkaria, was, along with the other students,
        ravaged and stunned by the attacks. She also spoke about her
        sense of guilt: because she had known catastrophes which had
        resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, yet the events
        of September 11th were writ into her spirit much more compellingly.
        Why was this? Not simply because these were Americans, nor that
        this was New York and Washington, but I think also because of
        the surreal and awesome beauty of the attacks, their casual making
        of what was previously only imagined, their busting out a hole
        in imagination, how they made us all feel helpless: the grandness
        of human evil, maybe reminiscent of the glory of the mushroom
        cloud rushing up to meet the bombers over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, on that sobering idea, let's switch
        to something perhaps a bit more domestic and anecdotal: There
        is so little written on the domestic politics and psychological
        aesthetics of cohabiting poets-- a useful and potentially rich
        topic it seems to me, especially given the large copulation of
        poet-partners. I mean <I>population</I> of poet-partners, excuse
        me... But I don't live with a significant-poet-other, and never
        have, so for this question here is my proposal: That both of
        you place your conjugal heads together, formulate a fascinating
        question on the topic, and then answer it. (Ah, what an easy
        job interviewing is...) And the question is:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">MB: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Gabe and I have copulated largely but
        still when it comes to putting our conjugal heads together we're
        at loggerheads, which is interesting, considering what loggerhead
        means in prison slang. We have a phenomenal daughter, Clio, and
        have worked hard to keep our family of four, which includes my
        daughter, Marina, together. At the moment we're struggling with
        the whole job situation. Our fields are very close: we're both
        poets; I have a PhD, Gabe has an MFA; we have influenced each
        other's literary and scholarly interests. I have just started
        a tenure-track job at the University of Mississippi; Gabe is
        hell-bent on getting one, which threatens separation for us.
        It's very difficult. Careers and finances don't mesh like bodies
        do. In the real world neither of us wants to be passive whereas
        in bed, I'm quite fond of it, and even Gabe likes it on occasion.
        As far as collaboration is concerned, I am a great believer in
        rhetoric - I believe that the conventions of the teacher/teacher
        relationship, or the business partner relationship can help us;
        the conventions of the heterosexual partnership don't really
        help us much at all, and spill over unhelpfully into our other
        endeavors. I remember reading a story about an artist, possibly
        Duchamp, who would kiss his wife goodbye each morning, then cycle
        around the block and return, at which point his wife would greet
        him, &quot;Bonjour Monsieur Duchamp,&quot; or whatever. Then,
        at the end of the working day, they did the whole thing in reverse.
        The story is only good if you see if from the man's point of
        view. It begins to be weird if Madame Duchamp is the one hopping
        on the bike and handing her coat and hat to her husband/secretary
        on her return. Rhetoric, being a convention, favors men. Nevertheless,
        it is the &quot;bicycle&quot; of this story and bicycles are
        organic, gendered entities, as we know from Flann O'Brien. You
        use what you have. Gabe and I have worked together on various
        projects: the ezine SUBMIT YOU DOG, teaching in the prison, and
        we have registered the name for a web journal we want to co-edit.
        It has been damned difficult. I believe we could do great things
        together in defiance of that damned difficulty. Gabe quotes Bukowski's
        epitaph to me: &quot;Don't Try&quot;. Well, my peripheral vision
        was poor the day we visited Bukowski's grave and all I saw was
        &quot;Try.&quot; I haven't formulated a question for you. Maybe
        Gabe will.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Indeed, it's very difficult. We have
        to balance being lovers and colleagues, moving between two very
        different ways of speaking and interacting, making sure that
        one side of the relationship does not harm or hinder the other
        side. It's like juggling a cotton bud, a brick and a bra.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I don't find the juggling difficult,
        just the different weights. Conversation between men is a brick.
        The voice of a woman in public should be a cotton-bud. A man's
        private woman is a bra. I think there is an old idea &shy; in
        Minnesota at least &shy; that a man should talk to men and a
        man's woman should keep out of the way. It enrages Minnesota
        men, I've noticed, to have (their) women disrupt their conversation.
        It's a public/private thing, and it's what has largely inhibited
        married women from publishing poetry, in Minnesota at least.
        Historically, partnership with men is diminishing for women,
        whose identities have traditionally been sketchy, legally and
        in the public domain. Doing this joint interview with you is
        a little bit innovative, though much more difficult than doing
        it separately. I feel like I butted my way in! It's a lot easier
        for a woman to speak when she's not in a partnership; that may
        be increasingly true for men too, as Gabe's aposiopetic episode
        above indicates.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As it certainly does. So now for my
        final question, and thank you both for your time and testiness.
        You both, as you mention above teach poetry in correctional institutions.
        Would you recommend to other teachers of creative writing that
        they do this? And how is teaching a poetry course in a prison
        different from teaching a poetry course at Cornell or University
        of Mississippi? Where do you feel more &quot;comfortable&quot;?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">GG: </FONT><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, first of all there is generally
        no compulsory reason for the inmates to be in the class, and
        the absence of compulsion completely changes the classroom, as
        you know. In a university, whether Cornell or U Miss, there is
        almost always a small group of students there to fulfill some
        requirement. In the past I have found that in such situations,
        &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; get filtered out,
        the result being usually some kind of continuous low-key trauma
        to the classroom and to me emotionally. When teaching, I think
        constantly of my time as a student at The Evergreen State College,
        and what a charged, furious, intelligent, and curious group of
        students my peers and teachers were, how we were all students
        in the best sense of the word's etymology (&quot;one who is eager
        for&quot;). Walking into a prison classroom whether it's a maximum
        security facility like Auburn, where your students are all violent
        felons, or a minimum security &quot;dormitory&quot; situation
        such as in Holly Springs MS, where the students are almost all
        enrolled in Bible College and are there primarily on drug charges
        is, for me, just like walking into an Evergreen seminar again:
        it is like I have a swingle torch lodged my nose and a roman
        candle spiked my butt and the students are all going to light
        me up, insofar as I know that something fascinating is going
        to happen, as a matter of fact I feel like each of my students
        has a swingle torch in his nose and live powder balled in his
        fundament. It isn't just the adrenaline and Dante-esque experience
        of walking into a place devoid of basic comforts such as privacy
        and personal safety; it's that students who are inmates know
        implicitly the value of what you have to offer, they are there
        with bells on, they are preternaturally disciplined, founting
        over with questions and challenges. They are also, as at Evergreen,
        incredibly politicized, as they should be, since the American
        judicial system is at base inexpugnably racist. So, it is especially
        sweet to teach politicized students, whom one more readily finds
        in a maximum-security facility: politicized students in a university
        are a rarity. And one especially welcomes this in a prison where
        two-thirds to four-fifths of your students are African-American.
        And the final thing that gives a prison teacher pedagogical succor
        is that your students already know the importance of writing,
        as it is their one means of contact with the outside world. But
        then there are the thrills and challenges of teaching with other
        teachers. I love team-teaching, and I team-taught at Auburn.
        Mairead and I do team-teach in Holly Springs. It's very hard
        to team-teach with your lover, as you can imagine, but it's something
        I'm excited about doing each week. Mairead?</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Teaching in Marshall County Correctional
        facility takes me out of Oxford one day a week. I'm still in
        a classroom, though it happens to be a brighter and slightly
        better equipped classroom than the classrooms I normally teach
        in. I turned back to academic life when I was in my late thirties.
        Up to then, things had been rough-and-tumble, and I had always
        worked across the arts, as a journalist writing plays, or a poet
        collaborating with painters, or in arts administration. I love
        teaching and literature but I miss being out and about. I find
        mobility in the prison in the same paradoxical way that Gabe
        finds a lack of compulsories. I suppose the prison teaching is
        our luxury, and it's expensive. As you can guess, I also put
        a very high value on the fact we're doing it together. We're
        also always trying to engage other teachers and visiting writers,
        and members of the English faculty at the University of Mississippi
        join us regularly. I feel as if I'm coming bearing unglamorous
        but useful gifts. I feel like a working poet, sort of the poet
        equivalent of a country doctor, handing out and picking up poems
        all day long. The prison class is the only all-male class I ever
        taught. I don't have to worry if I'm being sexist by calling
        on the men all the time. It is a strange meeting: the meeting
        of these guys and myself: quite tenuous but quite respectful
        and very polite. For me, it has that old excitement of the new,
        and the possibility of building something, i.e., a program which
        develops. This is good, useful, practical teaching: Yes, I'd
        recommend it to other creative writing teachers. Creative writing
        is gold anyway. In prison, it's platinum. One way teaching creative
        writing in prison is different from teaching at Cornell or the
        University of Mississippi is that we have to do all the photocopying.
        We bring things in. We bring things out. There are no casual
        encounters with students. We can invite them to Christmas dinner
        but they won't come. Comfort isn't an issue: you just work till
        you drop. In one of the 5-minute writing exercises we set for
        the students at Holly Springs, we said: &quot;Write about the
        most interesting thing that happened during the week.&quot; At
        the end of the 5 minutes, some guys read pieces about how nothing
        interesting ever happens in prison. But one guy said, &quot;The
        most interesting thing that happened this week is that I was
        comfortable, on Tuesday, between 8.30 and 8.37am.&quot; In prison
        teaching, in addition to David Lloyd's &quot;unexpungeable melancholy,&quot;
        whereby the student will eventually overturn the hierarchical
        relationship, there's a lateral dimension too: some day the prisoner
        will get out. I'm only beginning to realize how much is at stake.</FONT></P>
