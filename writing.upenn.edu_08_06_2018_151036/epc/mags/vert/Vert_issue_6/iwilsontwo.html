      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In our first few days<BR>
      of being together<BR>
      we decide to use the words &quot;raw sugar&quot;<BR>
      in place of love.<BR>
      But when she says, I raw sugar you,<BR>
      at the end of the first week,<BR>
      I am more surprised<BR>
      than a dog who wakes to find himself flying.<BR>
      Because I don't believe in raw sugar this soon,<BR>
      have never used raw sugar<BR>
      to get a girl to go to bed with me.<BR>
      Well, maybe once.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Then one day she says,<BR>
      Bird my ass,<BR>
      maybe angry or trying to be cute,<BR>
      but I'm willing.<BR>
      I want you to meet the Pharaoh, I say,<BR>
      and she says, No thumb trips,<BR>
      not just yet, maybe next cattle.<BR>
      We stop taking our coffee sweet.<BR>
      Leather me, she screams,<BR>
      and we are leathering on the table,<BR>
      on the floor, knocking<BR>
      over bottles full of light.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Finally we go to my thumb,<BR>
      and believe me it's a long trip by train.<BR>
      She wears her best dresses<BR>
      and smiles all the time.<BR>
      But raw sugar for me<BR>
      and so much leather<BR>
      won't get you the Pharaoh's approval.<BR>
      No matter how much cattle<BR>
      you come by, how many birds<BR>
      you press upon the throat,<BR>
      we can feel something slipping off,<BR>
      like a thread from a coat.<BR>
