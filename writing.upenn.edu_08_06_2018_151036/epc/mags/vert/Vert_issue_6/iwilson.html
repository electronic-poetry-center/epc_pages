      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My museuse gives me lancinate<BR>
      but my dyslexic ear hears lamination.<BR>
      In an act of coning, we have moved<BR>
      from serial drinking to that new kitchen<BR>
      she always wanted, a place where<BR>
      dogs fly among cadavers and I eat<BR>
      Royal Jelly after midnight because it's all<BR>
      I can afford. Let me pause<BR>
      to tell you that Dr. Hoagly Woagly's<BR>
      has the best avant-garde barbecue around.<BR>
      You can denude your fingers with<BR>
      sucking. Then, after a dinner of dissection,<BR>
      we'll retire to the hyperbolic chamber.<BR>
      You show me yawni<BR>
      and I'll show you mine<BR>
      if I still have one<BR>
      when the contractor collects.<BR>
      The temptation is to make a mountain<BR>
      out of a molehill of money, to pull<BR>
      things apart, one proton at a time, losing<BR>
      the center, obese with a pain that lingers<BR>
      long after tomorrow afternoon<BR>
      has started betting with another bookie.<BR>
      I'm going to demand a refund<BR>
      from my museuse or at least<BR>
      a full-body thesaurus. Something<BR>
      with words:<BR>
      A nostrum. A sleeping potion<BR>
      for idiots. A dead man<BR>
      and his flying dog.</FONT></P>
