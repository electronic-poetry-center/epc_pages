  ending, <BR>
  prefix, changes in the object &quot;you&quot; becomes going out

  according to rules whose logic is purely mathematical, the pull

  assumed to articulate (question) what the child wants across
  the room, as if things could be called <BR>

  picture, the dog whose tongue is out (gesture) <BR>

  in deep water, those two characters standing <BR>
  relative to the child who has disappeared on the one hand (ambiguous)
  on a plane in the second chapter <BR>
  before this one, the rock falling on the other (nothing) instead
  of thinking she has changed her mind, <BR>
  the orchestra at that point taking over (volume) for the man
