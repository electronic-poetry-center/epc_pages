      be it impassioned accents or instruments of paranormal phenomena.
      The voice extends. It waits here, it is ill in its wealth, it
      holds still for forty years. He laughs better when he laughs
      during closing remarks. Let us recite the simple speeches, the
      usual pinpricks of inclination; our French is monotonous, its
      stresses smaller. The tears and shouts, the energy and the thrills,
      always becalmed by the forces of collusion - this collision exudes
      truth, and indeed in the morning the father determines that he
      is himself still the good son, and from him quiet comes. It is
      because false company is so instructive; it is for the loss of
      innocence, the lack of guarantees. With these false men, all
      becomes undisguised, and there they learn to hold themselves
      up and regard how damaged they are.<BR>
