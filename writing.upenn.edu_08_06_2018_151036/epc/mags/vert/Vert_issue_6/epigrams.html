      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Craig Dworkin</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He is an Assistant Professor
      at Princeton,<BR>
      a scholar on the names of famous poets<BR>
      hidden as paragrams and hypergrams within<BR>
      the works of various writers. Recently, he<BR>
      organized a panel on Yasusada at his esteemed<BR>
      University and didn't invite me. How weird that<BR>
      all the letters of my legal name were contained<BR>
      inside the names of the scheduled presenters!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Fanny Howe</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">She's a bit of a Christian Talmudist,<BR>
      as if Dickinson had come back and could<BR>
      believe. Something huge and metallic<BR>
      draws signs in the sky over elaborate<BR>
      systems of tunnels and caves. I hope she's<BR>
      right that there is another place outside<BR>
      &quot;this purgatory of letters and things.&quot;<BR>
      I mean above the signs, and not below.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Norman Fischer</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He is often associated with
      the &quot;Language school.&quot;<BR>
      However, Norman Fischer is an ordained Buddhist<BR>
      priest, and therefore should not be casually lumped<BR>
      together with the modern-day Cavalier court poets.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dan Featherstone</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He is a very gifted youngish
      poet and critic.<BR>
      His name makes me think of that physics <BR>
      question in my fifth grade science book:<BR>
      &quot;If Galileo climbs to the top of the University<BR>
      bell tower and drops a ten lb. bag of feathers<BR>
      and a ten lb. bag of stones at exactly the <BR>
      same time, which will hit the ground first?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Hmm... Probably Perelman before
      Bob.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Sianne Ngai</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">All young poets and critics<BR>
      of the post-Language after-image<BR>
      yearn, as is human, to leave <BR>
      a poetic something that has never <BR>
      before been thought or said, something, <BR>
      perhaps, that comments on their <BR>
      singular cultural condition. By writing <BR>
      about a cockroach eating a turd, <BR>
      Sianne Ngai has done that.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">*</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Bill Luoma</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Bill Luoma is a poet and minor
      league baseball player.<BR>
      In an essay, he says that the idea of disrupting the male<BR>
      gaze through particular grammatical and syntactical<BR>
      strategies has outlived its usefulness. Then, foul ball,<BR>
      he says that if a man is going to write about a woman's<BR>
      vagina, he should foreground strong verbs, as does<BR>
      Eileen Myles, and not predicate nouns, as does<BR>
      Andre Breton. Then, foul ball, he draws a picture of a<BR>
      phallic-looking space ship getting sucked into a vagina-<BR>
      looking black hole, where the space ship is The Poet<BR>
      and the black hole is Culture. Then, strike three, he says<BR>
      that when he strikes out, the catcher sometimes says,<BR>
      &quot;Does your pussy hurt today?&quot; And that's how his essay
      ends.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Joseph Duemer</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He has edited an anthology of
      verse about dogs.<BR>
      Among minor poets, he alone can claim this honor.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Diane Wakoski</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Someone said he had seen her<BR>
      five or six years ago, going, at great<BR>
      velocity, down the 90 foot jump.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">They have sent out a ski patrol,
      with<BR>
      headlamps, to look for her.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Gary Snyder</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When I had him come to read
      in Freeport, oh,<BR>
      five or six years back, we drank a bunch of beers<BR>
      at Tony's Oyster Tap. On the last night we ever<BR>
      spoke, he suddenly and coolly said, &quot;You know,<BR>
      Kent, the Japanese are polite. But if Yasusada<BR>
      had been Navajo or Sioux, you would have had<BR>
      two or three long-braided dudes waiting on your<BR>
      stoop.&quot; I lit a cigarette, blew a ring, looked at the<BR>
      legendary man, and said (watching him straighten<BR>
      in surprise where he sat), &quot;You know, Gary, I, too,<BR>
      am polite. But here're two words that would pop to mind<BR>
      in such an event, and you can put them under your hat:<BR>
      Baseball, and Bat.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Ray Di Palma</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In the letters page of Lingua
      Franca,<BR>
      Ray Di Palma had an argument with<BR>
      Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein<BR>
      over who came up with the idea for<BR>
      the equals signs. Di Palma said it was he<BR>
      who did; Andrews and Bernstein said it<BR>
      was they who did. Each tacitly accused<BR>
      the other of intellectual theft and the<BR>
      wilfull revision of literary history. One thing<BR>
      is certain: Somewhere, a naughty, naughty<BR>
      Author is L=Y=I=N=G.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Katy Lederer</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">She is also on the beach. It
      is from the sunburn<BR>
      of Poetry that her skin is peeling. Gingerly, she pulls it<BR>
      off in long and quietly crackling rice-paper strips.<BR>
      (Now a surfer wipes out and never comes up.<BR>
      Now a small conch washes up on the sand. Now<BR>
      a boy on an air mattress is torn to shreds by a shark.)<BR>
      Katy Lederer's eyes are rolled back behind their<BR>
      shut lids, and she peels and peels. Slowly,<BR>
      satisfyingly, she sheds the dead form of the body<BR>
      that has been, so to come into the true body, that form<BR>
      which is here, on this beach, at this moment, and which<BR>
      is the very Form and Idea of the younger Avant-Garde:<BR>
      A nose and mouth, an asshole, toes, and hair, a form<BR>
      forever new, moist, professional, and maximally ambitious.</FONT></P>

      critical study,<BR>
      published by Northwestern University Press,<BR>
      and Dean for Academic Affairs at the University<BR>

      Opposing Poetries, wherein Language writing<BR>

      Academic verse.</FONT></P>
