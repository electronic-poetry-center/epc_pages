        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Media Insider Reveals Enron
        Correspondence</FONT></B></P>
        <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By John Troyer</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cherished and dearest of readers,
        I have a wonderful surprise for one and all. Before I open the
        Pandora's box upon which I sit --plunging us all into the rabbit's
        hole and through the looking glass --I must confide a secret.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many people do not know I spent
        some time working on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. I have
        incriminating photographs of myself standing next to various
        political leaders and wearing a suit without any irony as proof.
        After re-reading Goethe's &quot;Faust&quot; at the end of my
        power-hungry legislative assistant internship in the land of
        the great white father, I decided to avoid the business of brimstone
        and work instead as an arts administrator. I still sold my soul,
        but for significantly less money.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All of that, however, is not
        the point. Even though I chose not to work in Washington, D.C.,
        I have maintained several contacts --people burrowed deep within
        the governmental system. My contacts, or &quot;Deeper Throats,&quot;
        as I call them, have provided me with important information regarding
        the current Enron bankruptcy.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Brief pause: Does anyone else
        find the term &quot;bankruptcy&quot; somewhat inadequate when
        used in conjunction with the Enron Corporation's complete and
        total financial implosion -- liquidating the personal finances
        of thousands of employees who loved their (CLAP-CLAP-CLAP) deep-in-the-heart-of-Texas
        employer? Why the categories &quot;confidence scheme&quot; and
        &quot;money laundering&quot; have not been used more widely is
        somewhat of a mystery. But then again, the American Indians were
        just &quot;relocated&quot; in the 19th century, so maybe Enron
        can as well be &quot;bankrupt.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What my collective of Deeper
        Throats handed me this week are copies of the secret &quot;meetings&quot;
        between Vice President Dick Cheney (I still prefer the term &quot;prime
        minister&quot; or maybe even Il Duce) and various former, mostly
        living, executives of the Enron Corporation.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I know it sounds far-fetched
        that somehow a pesky columnist with an FBI file the size of Antarctica
        could somehow receive documents the General Accounting Office
        director David M. Walker (a Republican, no less --GO TEAM GO!)
        is suing in federal court to examine. I know the proverbial numbers
        don't add up, but since I use the Florida Method for Computational
        Certainty, trust me, I have the documents.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As a public service, I will now
        present excerpts from a sampling of the various memos, e-mail
        messages and faxes I received last week from my sources.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Item 1:</FONT></B></P>

        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Recipient: Dick Cheney</FONT></B></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mr. President, oops, I mean Dick
        (HA! HA!), I've got a hangover the size of Ted Kennedy this morning.
        The boyeeeez in the House and Senate sure know how to kick it!
        I didn't think Strom was ever going to settle down last night.
        And that Lieberman --what a comedian!! Too bad he's not the VP
        (J/K Big Guy).</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By the way, I wrote a list of
        names down on a napkin and gave it to your boss at a weekend
        barbecue. Make sure he didn't lose it ... I should have given
        it to Laura. Anyway, just some names/good people to know WHEN
        THINKING ABOUT ENERGY POLICIES. I'm not saying these people should
        be on any REGULATORY COMMISSIONS or anything, because we both
        know that would potentially be illegal and I know you love Enron
        so maybe you want to SELL YOUR STOCK NOW to invest in some other
        companies. Just a thought out of left field. XOXOXO. KL.</FONT></P>

        <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Excerpt from a Fax sent by
        Ken Lay at Enron headquarters to the White House, June 2001</FONT></B></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear President Bush,</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I am growing increasingly concerned
        with the energy crisis in California. No one likes knowing rolling
        blackouts are keeping vital electricity from hospitals, nursing
        homes and schools. The children, Mr. President, my concerns are
        for the children of California.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My company has prepared an easy
        solution for the energy problems of California; we call it the
        &quot;Out of Sight/Out of Mind Contingency.&quot; The plan involves
        pushing several nuclear power facilities sitting on or near the
        San Andreas Fault to critical mass, causing massive core meltdowns
        that would sever California from North America. The entire state
        would then sink into the Pacific Ocean and cease requiring electricity.
        Our plan is guaranteed to make our shareholders happy, including
        YOUR MOTHER, as the nine-hundred-pound gorilla that is California
        would finally be off our backs.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Please advise when and how the
        operation should begin. As well, I have taken the liberty to
        purchase some LARGE GOURMET PRETZELS for you to EAT while relaxing
        in the White House. Please accept the gift as small token of
        thanks. The pretzels will begin arriving in the fall ....</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Boy oh boy, am I tired of looking
        at all these notes from Enron. Here's plan #2: We'll take the
        money from the Social Security Administration and invest it in
        Enron stock --boy do I love these free markets. Just keep signing
        the checks; that's what I say.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm heading down to Florida for
        a book reading tomorrow. I love spending time with the kids --keeps
        me out of the office. I hope they have a &quot;Curious George&quot;
        book at the school. Keep an eye on the shop for me. And I still
        don't know why you said to make sure everyone I knew was away
        from New York tomorrow but you're the &quot;boss.&quot; {;)Will
        do Buckaroo. [:) I do love flying in Air Force One --sometimes
        the stewardess gives me the whole can to drink. WHOOPPEE.</FONT></P>

        about insider trading information and offshore shadow companies
        being peddled in the LIBERAL MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT is all WRONG.
        It was all for fakesies, not realsies. Tell Aschcroft to remember
        whose been buttering his bread. And the PRETZELS Dick, make him

        chum. I'll be leaving for a business trip soon, very very soon
        to France. I hear the extradition treaty agreements are lovely
        over there. Wink-wink. Anyway, I'm outta here until the whole
        people-lost-all-their-money business is done and over with --
        Linda and I are barely squeezing by with our 18 or so properties
        for sale in Texas and Colorado.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sorry about the pretzels; we'll
        try beef jerky next time. I love you like a brother, man, so
        I would hate to see any of the PRIVLEDGED CONVERSATIONS between
        us go public. Just because YOUR NAME AND PAW PRINTS are all over
        my company should be of little CONCERN. Kenny.</FONT></P>
