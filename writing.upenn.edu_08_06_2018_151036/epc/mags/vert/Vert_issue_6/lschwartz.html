    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The New Babel</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel of course is the fall
    of a Tower, followed by a vast, manipulated confusion of words.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babble is language's beginning,
    before its a language, while its still song.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As Babel is both a ground and
    a zero, Middle English<I> grund </I>and Arabic <I>zefir</I>,
    cipher, Gallacized zero - lets call it Ground Zero.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is defiance of the demiurge
    and hubris of the heart, ziggurat aimed at suns yet unborn, inside
    the mouth the mouth as desire: man creates gods.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Where before stood the North
    and South Phallus now yawns a smoldering Cleft, smoke subject
    to variable breezes.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The smoke contains bodies; we
    breathe one another. Thus, Babel is Kabul.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As Ares broods over all the
    world's capitals: fragments of furniture spun from seized cockpits,
    strangers blinking into craters of Mars.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is Kabul: Babel's a Bible
    in a motel room dresser in Birmingham, Alabama: Babel's the Battery
    Park Esplanade and the people waiting in the airport in Santo
    Domingo.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel: the most beautiful girl
    in all of Kashgar, black haired, black eyed, maybe 13 years old?
    In a gay red dress, gazing admiringly at the foreign lady chance
    brought to her alley, gently, tentatively, mouthing a single
    phrase in English, addressed to that lady: &quot;How do you do&quot;?</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is mettlesome, its scrotum
    melted some, our mad extravagant metropolis, not bashful, still
    seeking the heights.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel was Mesopotamia, it's
    era's only superpower: redound of Gilgamesh, modern day Iraq.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is Baghdad, Babel is Belgrade,
    Babel's our backyard, a World that incessantly Trades names with
    itself.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babble in three languages, babble
    in three thousand: put on a bib.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A baby babbled of lions eating
    books. And those lions ate books: Bable is books on the shelves
    of the Bibiliotheque Queer.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No rabble in Babel: everyone's
    speech an equally valid muse. Thus: bomb them with butter.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Here is the blade with which
    Babel's abolished, here are the furrows where Babel begins, which
    no seed can boycott.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel rinses its parents in
    sorrow, Bable rewards its makers with slowworms, Babel is birth,
    rebuilding with cranes all sorts of crimes, the way life is a
    dagger, the way all wars begin with some bed's destruction.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Who shaved her cunt with Babel's
    boxcutter: born from the rubble, &quot;ba&quot; is for father,
    &quot;ma-ma&quot; is for mother, sacred baboons patrolling her
    precincts.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is Buddha dispensing with
    words, Babel is mating, thunder, whale blubber and rain, Babel
    is blame, Babel is ax, Babel is Bush-ben-Laden and fame.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">As tall facades crumble like
    rockface, so many unbound mountains, Captain FBI simply offers
    &quot;My bad&quot;.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babble of waves, babble of wharves,
    of merchants and stores, city proud of its iron and brains: babble
    is braggart, babble is pulpit, babble's a word on the tip of
    your tongue or the trouble stored in a bull's flaring nostrils.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I'm down with the Tower of Babel.</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I can't even enjoy a blade
    of grass unless I know there's a subway handy or record store
    or some other sign that people do not totally regret life.</FONT></I></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Is stumble, is stutter, is stone
    smooth as skin, towers swaying the way they sway in the wind,
    as a person is always his tongue's own half-willing puppet.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Is the baker whose cakes are
    too hot, whose pancakes are unscaleable, whose loaves are uncanny
    and sprinkled with pain.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Is flesh covered with brine,
    is bitumen cracked with fever, wolves in the blood howling to
    the gibbous heart.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is the beaten ballplayer
    who goes ballistic; Babel is an icicle in your mouth as melodious
    as a flute, as percussive in its dripping as drums.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Tower whose twisted tendrils
    resemble the trellis and grapes, destruction demanded by the
    Dionysus of east meeting west, an unwillingness to consent to
    any loss of the self.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is nothing but the celebration
    of words, talk armed with torches, dreams capsized by bigger
    dreams, the truth of each crater, the &quot;bang bang&quot; that
    wakes one from dream, the gap between &quot;its an accident&quot;
    and &quot;my god its intentional&quot;, the B1 Bomber they're
    building and building, the backlash and the backlash to backlash
    and the backlash to backlash to backlash, O Barrio of Barriers,
    our republic of fear.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Enough elasticity to move with
    the wind, enough stiffness so that people can't know the building
    is moving: Babel is bubblegum stuck to your face.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is presence, Babel is
    absence: nothing but the celebration of presence. <I>No mas</I>
    to sacred explosions, no mas to the occupation of land: sacred
    explosions, the occupation of land.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is how a man howls as
    he leaps from the heights, where no other man can hear him; Babel
    is that moment of imagining one can fly, a brevity that lasts
    forever in Babel's unconscious.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Babel is a ray of sunlight crashing
    earthbound, a rivulet of rays crashing earthbound, a field mined
    with light.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The Tower of Babel: word up.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If architecture is frozen music,
    then these melted, smoking shards are its melodies, its incandescent
    burial grounds - Babel become what begs you to</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Tahoma">sing it.</FONT></P>
