      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When writers get interviewed
      in the Paris <BR>
      Review, they seem always to get asked: How do you compose--<BR>
      with a pencil, a pen, or a typing machine?&quot; Is the title
      of your <BR>
      new book, Pen Chants, an answer to that question?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Lissa Wolsak:
      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I am partial to those
      flat, whittled, carpenter's <BR>
      pencils not least for the thick and thin of it, but use a pen.
      I often <BR>
      write 'on the move', interstitially, so a pen is the right tool
      for me <BR>
      as it latches onto a notebook.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The title came from another
      order of impulse altogether, in an <BR>
      interadiant set of causes/effects. I'm working from a position
      of <BR>
      inadvertence, where it is not the pen suggests 'it' so much as
      'it' <BR>
      suggests the pen. Of course I also take from precisely what is
<BR>
      easily present, ex-sistere (to stand out or emerge), but not
      in this <BR>
      case.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> To me, the poems in your book seem
      somehow both deeply <BR>
      rhapsodic and deftly formal. What is the relationship for you
<BR>
      between inspiration and technique?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">LW:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> They are nested spherics. I am truly
      interested in what is <BR>
      disabled by formalism, in inspiration/insight, qui vive, as it
<BR>
      oscillates experientially, anti-yak, and rather than catechism
      or <BR>
      techniques per se, I think more in terms of skeletal purpose,
<BR>
      manipulate perceptions by employing an intent practice of <BR>
      deliberation on: prismoid knowing/not-knowing, exo-eso, urgent
<BR>
      radical withdrawal, detournement, musical phrasing, breath, <BR>
      rhythm etc. I am ignorant of any but a few literary techniques
<BR>
      because what I am after is unguided, ungovernable, <BR>
      autocatalytic. Enough constraints are embedded in the everyday
<BR>
      so that provoking them further does not occur to me.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> What is poetry's object for you: Pleasure
      or truth?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">LW:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> For me the object is invisible, molecular
      effortlessness/timelessness.<BR>
      To scratch a surface... to find, to make.. to make motion, depth
<BR>
      of agency, fruit for peace, to resist, circuit-break, to ask
      ~of <BR>
      cognition and consciousness more than it seems willing to give,
<BR>
      to add a witness-mark or an aesthetic valence, peri-feral <BR>
      immediacy, political specular hammer-blows, interthronging <BR>
      sublime reflection, experiential unconcealing, vernacular <BR>
      architecture, trans-gypsy, largely refusing rest...to generate
      ideas <BR>
      splendidly different every time one looks, a great pleasure I
<BR>
      would not presume to sum up.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Pen Chants is full of unusual, secret-seeming
      vocabulary<BR>
      flavors. For example:</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inky&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violet
      sugar<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue rue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chartreuse
      horehound,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">in umbels or heads,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spike-train,<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spin-glass<BR>
      unbranched but entangled,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benth, shield-fern,
      teasel<BR>
      erect to sprawling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blister-rust,
      slink-lily<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swards
      of silver-grass</FONT></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This almost is reminiscent for
      me of Zukofsky's late work, <BR>
      another poet who certainly savored the taste of words. Has his
      poetry <BR>
      impacted you? What other poets would be part of the &quot;rammed
      earth&quot; of <BR>
      this book, if I could quote that wonderful phrase you use?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">LW: </FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;A&quot; was the first book of
      poetry I ever bought and I've <BR>
      read his superb 80 Flowers a decade or so ago; though I felt
<BR>
      and thought more about Stein, Olson, S. Howe, Beckett, but <BR>
      especially Celan at the time, so I would say that I am impacted,
<BR>
      but subliminally in aftshadow.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I feel stricken by, and sped
      along by the staggeringly brilliant <BR>
      contemporary work being done, Doubled Flowering <BR>
      amongst them. Douglas Oliver and Alice Notley I met and was reading
<BR>
      intensely during the last half of Pen Chants. Ten pages were
      written at <BR>
      their behest for Gare du Nord. I felt very, very inspired by
      Doug and Alice, <BR>
      both in their writings and in their persons. The death of Douglas
      Oliver is an <BR>
      unspeakable loss to humankind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Lisa Robertson's work is superb
      and continues to occupy me. <BR>
      Moreover, Celan. I see no beginning, no end to the question of
<BR>
      influence, something similar to stepping on a draft. David <BR>
      Bromige and I spoke often during that period, and I am <BR>
      enormously, invaluably heartened by him.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Literally, &quot;rammed earth&quot;
      is both a building material and a <BR>
      method of constructing a house, alongside other imaginative <BR>
      possibilities.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Taking simultaneity seriously,
      what I have hoped is that the <BR>
      &quot;secret-seeming vocabulary&quot; is a reclamation, a sentient
      interlude <BR>
      intriguing or familiar enough, through sound or otherwise, to
<BR>
      etymologically span archaic-modernist-futurist memory, create
<BR>
      space, matter, curiosity, reflection, as often many of these
<BR>
      references possess one or more universal cultural elements <BR>
      which point, or are ideas, of themselves. I don't subscribe to
      the <BR>
      idea that one can speak in middlebrow, instantly accessible to
<BR>
      all. I use the vocabulary that appears.<BR>
<BR>
      Generally speaking, I am involved in a project that interests
      itself <BR>
      in that which reveals its own character, and why and in those
<BR>
      matters which cannot be forced, to find a depth of mercy,<BR>
      powers of the whole mouth, what inhabits and misfits. It is a
      way <BR>
      for me to conceive hope in that which is not-yet.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> The book's subtitle includes the phrase
      &quot;12 spirit-like <BR>
      impermanences.&quot; But the book is composed of numerous, <BR>
      completely interlocked movements-nothing seems discrete. <BR>
      Why the '12' ?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">LW:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Yes, it is a long poem, no split. The
      &quot;12&quot; was for cheek, <BR>
      stealth, and preposterousness.I think it laughs back at itself,
      at the <BR>
      pretense of legitimizing, of naming the unnamable. It is also,
      by its <BR>
      withdrawn nature, a defrayal and assault on ownership, its <BR>
      litmuses, and that of being governed (badly).</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">KJ:</FONT></B><FONT

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">LW:</FONT></B><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Government is a bleeding wave, an inversion
      of thought too <BR>
      often devoid of love for its people. Moreover, there is the <BR>
      horrific incessance of its harm and rubbersheet/force-field <BR>
      demurral to ethical self-critique and insight. Pursuantly, we
      are <BR>
      so attracted by our weapons.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> Snake eyes, with inumerable departures.
      I have no formal <BR>
      education in either of these fields and learn through <BR>
      experimenting, looking and reading, doing. Both teach me to <BR>
      remove mystique, and to really look at what I am looking at.
<BR>
      Both are architectonic, autonomous. I'm intoxicated by fire,
      light <BR>
      traveling through color, integrity of materials and making <BR>
      something where there was nothing. In both, I dead-reckon, and
<BR>
      proceed by listening to mercurial materials. I love the overpowering
<BR>
      silence involved.</FONT></P>

       SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> I think the term &quot;propulsive&quot;
      is an apt one for your poetry, <BR>
      not that there wouldn't be other terms equally felicitous. Is
      it <BR>
      possible to say what more propels the writing onward for you?
<BR>
      What's the ground energy you are most attentive to in the act
      of <BR>
      composing? Is it phonemic, lexical, phrasal, or something else?
      I <BR>
      know all of these things get intertwined, but do you notice what
<BR>
      is closest to your heart and ear, so to speak?</FONT></P>
