        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Nodding longer, in need, something
        there that I desired - when necessity's pressure appeared, I
        could not find its substance. I cannot say when I discovered
        the desert, though it was early, and though it exacted its vengeance.
        I think of that, the fantastic things it whispered that I did
        not know and do not now recall, the things of which I had no
        conception until further examination amid this great solitude
        - and the whisper's allure has proven irresistible, its intention
        inscrutable. Sea on the right, to the left; during all this,
        the inflamed wild was crossed with measures, its justice corrupted
        by a fast flash of cash. Savage eyes magnify me, something sinister
        and stately in this deliberate progress. I had been robbed of
        a series of options, or I had lacked the drive to mine my destiny
        in this life, the entire thing that can be made in this country.<BR>
