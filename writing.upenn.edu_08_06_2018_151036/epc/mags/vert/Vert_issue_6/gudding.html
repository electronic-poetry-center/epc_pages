        now i am on the trail of the lone booby, that is who I am the
        hunter of the booby. Sometimes it flies sometimes it goes along
        on booby legs spouting steam from its nipple. in it a engine
        of mother cloth is burning to make the steam pressure burble.
        long time i have sought the lone booby through distant graveyard,
        and seen it once or twice flopping off a headstone. But I a duck
        and:ducks cannot grasp what it wants with its feet-hands, its
        hand is its mouth -- and so am i with the booby: i have slammed
        down my head to grab the flopping booby upon a gravestone and
        sucked not the booby</FONT></P>
