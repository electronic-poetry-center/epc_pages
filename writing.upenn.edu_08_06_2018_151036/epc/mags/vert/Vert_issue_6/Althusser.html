      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Mr. Johnson:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Umberto Eco alerted me, and
      with considerable excitement, to the discussion <BR>
      at your internet listserv concerning &quot;the academy and the
      avant-garde.&quot; It <BR>
      was the first time he had communicated with me since the first
      edition of <BR>
      _Foucault's Pendulum_, so you can imagine that I was made curious.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Perhaps what first caught my
      fancy (I began from Mr. Kasey S. Mohammad's <BR>
      post on this day and have been reading backwards into September),
      was Mr. <BR>
      Mohammad's question: &quot;As soon as any mode of writing secures
      a sizable <BR>
      audience, it's capable of being sytematized and taught, but is
      there any <BR>
      evidence that such a process makes poetry any worse (or better)
      than it <BR>
      would otherwise be?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It occurred to me that Gramsci
      says something relevant to this somewhere in <BR>
      his Prison Notebooks, and so I looked it up:<BR>
      &quot;The crisis consists in the fact that the old is dying and
      the new cannot be <BR>
      born. In this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms
      appear.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Imagine my amazement to find
      that the same quote had been entered in an <BR>
      earlier posting by Mr. David Baratier, but to get to my point--
      Gramsci's <BR>
      quote is pregnant with significance, and it seems to me that
      Mr. Mohammad <BR>
      has missed something crucial about the nature of poetic advance,
      which has <BR>
      little to do with bourgeois notions of 'better' or 'worse'. The
      point, it <BR>
      seems to me (tho, as you may know, I am a clinically insane philosopher
      with <BR>
      a criminal record and not a poet, so you may take what I say
      with a grain of <BR>
      salt), is that avant-garde poetry's quickening institutionalization
      into the <BR>
      Ideological State Apparatus of the academy (and the resultant
      stamping into <BR>
      experiment's naturally libidinal body of reified indices of production
      and <BR>
      exchange which the educational ISA is charged with reproducing,
      if you'll <BR>
      forgive me for that tortured formulation) virtually guarantees
      that <BR>
      &quot;avant-garde&quot; formations --tho their linguistic product
      on the page may <BR>
      fetishistically appear &quot;better&quot; or more &quot;advanced&quot;
      as finished academic <BR>
      commodity -- retain (historical materialism is like a centrifuge,
      isn't it, <BR>
      so breathtaking in its clarifications!) a fundamental *ideological
<BR>
      sameness*, a sameness which encircles poetry into, shall we say,
      a totalized <BR>
      epistemic collaborationism, sapping it of its original potential
      to <BR>
      scandalize and erode hegemonic technologies and relations of
      absorption. <BR>
      &quot;The dialectic,&quot; as my wife used to coo from behind
      the pages of L'Humanite, <BR>
      &quot;does not always *advance*.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Of course, in the global sense,
      you are right that Authorship is the <BR>
      suck-hole.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No, Mr. Mohammad, the task of
      poetry is not to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;better&quot;; the
<BR>
      task of poetry is (to make an allusion) *to change the world*.
      This, for <BR>
      example, is why I liked the young Situationist kids and why they
      liked me. <BR>
      The so-called Language poets of the United States and their graduate
<BR>
      students should read some of those old, heady texts-- not to
      be <BR>
      confrontational, but in them, they may recognize themselves as
      among the <BR>
      enemy...</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Of course, those more literate
      Language and Post-Language poets who have <BR>
      studied me (semi-pro and above) will probably be asking by now:
      &quot;But what <BR>
      about the ISA as a site of warring discourses, as a site of class
      struggle? <BR>
      Isn't our entry into the academy a strategic option in this regard?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">To which I will say: Since my
      arrest and trial, I have somewhat modified my <BR>
      position on political realism vis a vis ISA's, but still, even
      from the view <BR>
      of _Lenin and Philosophy_ and all my other early work, my stress
      was <BR>
      primarily on how ideology interpolates the individual as subject,
      that this <BR>
      interpolation &quot;is *realized* in institutions, in their rituals
      and <BR>
      practices,&quot; and that &quot;from within ideology we have
      to outline a discourse <BR>
      which tries to break with ideology.&quot; It is clear, to anyone
      who knows <BR>
      anything about innovative American poetries since 1989 (as I
      do, through <BR>
      having weekly cafe with my good friend Jean-Paul Auxemery), that
      not only is <BR>
      there no discourse being outlined, there is no inkling to even
      *see* the <BR>
      underlying function and structure from which one has a certain
      duty to <BR>
      break. But alas, this is the great power of ideology.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Well, I hope these hurried notes
      are not so intrusive on my part. It is <BR>
      amazing how computers bring people into contact, isn't it. Can
      you imagine <BR>
      if Marx were alive today? My God!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">with esteemed wishes,</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Re: Letter from L. Althusser</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Mr. Mohammad, MD.:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I feel it is unnecessary for
      you to shower me with your faux lingo. It is <BR>
      impolite. I can speak English quite fluently (with, granted,
      a few missteps <BR>
      here and here), so may we please keep this conversation on the
      level? Merci.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Someone is waiting (yes, that
      is exactly right, someone is waiting) so I <BR>
      must be brief. When you say:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;If I'd had my eyes open,
      I would have seen that writers like Charles <BR>
      Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Bruce Andrews, Lyn Hejinian, Susan Howe,
      and so <BR>
      forth, by inspiring younger writers to imitate some of their
      techniques via <BR>
      academic transmission of texts and practices, are perpetuators
      of totalized <BR>
      epistemic collaboration. I mean, it's clear as a dang-blasted
      bell that <BR>
      fundamental ideological sameness is the sole and inevitable result
      of that <BR>
      cultural moment of dysappropriation.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I should like to say:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This matter of sameness has
      nothing to do with &quot;textuality itself.&quot; It is, <BR>
      rather, the sameness the museum does not allow you to see. The
      exhibit space <BR>
      seems natural, and the frame around the painting, too. Incidentally,
      in <BR>
      regards to these topics, and in addition to my writings, you
      should also <BR>
      assign to your students the books of my estranged friend, Pierre
      Macherey.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Later, when you say:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;I made the mistake of
      thinkin' that poetry had to do with a multi-channeled <BR>
      current of desire, in which a perfected familiarization with
      textual <BR>
      surfaces and sub-surface rhetorical spider veins was as much
      a legitimate <BR>
      skill to be directed toward breaking with underlying ideological
      structures <BR>
      and functions as more direct and forceful material intervention...&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I should like to say:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It is surely a legitimate &quot;skill&quot;
      to do these things with currents and <BR>
      surfaces --currents and surfaces, I will say, that your _Hovercraft_
      deftly <BR>
      glides over (Frederic Jameson had written to me about your book
      with <BR>
      certitude from his present post in China, where he is teaching
      at the <BR>
      Business College of the People's Revolutionary Army); however,
      it is my <BR>
      contention that to think of this surface-darting skill as something
      that is <BR>
      &quot;as much a legitimate skill&quot; as &quot;more direct and
      forceful material <BR>
      interventions&quot; as you elegantly say, is something akin to
      equating the <BR>
      _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844_ with _Capital_,
      or to <BR>
      equate the architecture of Wall Street with the concept of Production,
      or to <BR>
      equate a hovercraft with a rocket ship. Yes, as Mr. (or is it
      Ms.?) Kent <BR>
      Johnson has perceptively said, ideology is a certain gravity
      that must be <BR>
      overcome so as to get a bigger picture of things. You need a
      &quot;Craft&quot;, as <BR>
      they say at the Ecole Normale, that can go really, really fast,
      making <BR>
      little hyper-jumps, using the very curvature that ideology carves
      in <BR>
      cultural space-time to slingshot poetic craft into other-dimensional
      orbit. <BR>
      I have murdered my beloved wife, but this is not a metaphor.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">And the above reason is why
      it does not matter if I am &quot;boondoggled&quot; at the <BR>
      University of Santa Clara. Philosophy creates a picture; poetry
      jumps out of <BR>
      it. A woman's body has fifty nine stab wounds, randomly, in it;
      there is a <BR>
      transparent young worker from Fiat outside my window.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I hope my bad taste does not
      offend you, Dr. Mohammad, but to make another <BR>
      allusion, I, for one, am not an Althusserian.</FONT></P>
