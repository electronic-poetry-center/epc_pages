    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">YOU TALK ABOUT CIVILIZATION, and that
    it shouldn't be,<BR>
    Or shouldn't be the way it is.<BR>
    You say everybody suffers, or the majority of everybody,<BR>
    And it's because humans make things that way.<BR>
    You say if things were different, we'd suffer less.<BR>
    You say if things were like you want them, it would be better.<BR>
    I hear you without listening.<BR>
    Why should I want to listen to you?<BR>
    Listening to you won't make me know any better.<BR>
    If things were different, they'd be different: that's all.<BR>
    If things were like you want them, they'd only be like you want
    them.<BR>
    Oh, you and everybody else going through life<BR>
    Wanting to invent a machine for making happiness!<BR>
