        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Relish the complexity more likely<BR>
        To be the question &quot;are we fighting?&quot;<BR>
        Than &quot;what are we fighting for?&quot; Singing<BR>
        Is fighting, fighting the song that comes<BR>
        Like a mistake in someone else's<BR>
        As if that's the only way to work within<BR>
        Harmonic laws, to fight within melodic walls.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Oh, for a horse of air, a patient
        producer,<BR>
        A white flag of surrender, a sheet of music<BR>
        With no notes not your own, from within<BR>
        The glade where health and happiness<BR>
        Are one but must seem two, or more,<BR>
        Lest we hear from within no harmony<BR>
        But the monotony of unison in the endless<BR>
        Clash of swords and crash of bombs<BR>
        To destroy earth with earth, to bomb<BR>
        The desolate back into life as if<BR>
        That were submission. My war song<BR>
        Surrenders its aims to the patriotism<BR>
        Of partying, the consumer consumed<BR>
        By produce (without a supermarket<BR>
        For a face it'd be inhuman)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Happy and healthy outside the
        mean,<BR>
        The truce of balance, the cease fire<BR>
        Of song slung like grease at the diner<BR>
        I made a simple killing to build<BR>
        The bombings of the complex,<BR>
        Flowers fiercely rooted in carpets<BR>
        Pouches whose health provides<BR>
        A slower happiness for which<BR>
        We lack patience and lack patients<BR>
        Who know not what they do,<BR>
        And doctors who would if they did.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Damn this war between health
        &amp; happiness<BR>
        And being in the midst you can't know<BR>
        &amp; knowing in the midst you can't be.<BR>
        A duality of good for nothing knowers<BR>
        And actors reciting lines they forget<BR>
        They authored once upon a time<BR>
        Before society wedged itself<BR>
        between the food we will become<BR>
        and the shit we were like a song<BR>
        mistaken for a war by someone<BR>
        I'd believe in if he had the guts<BR>
        To say he doesn't believe in anything</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Chris Stroffolino has just recently
        moved to Oakland. He teaches at St. Mary's College and is diligently
        trying to save up enough money to rent a rehearsal/performance
        loft to lure Bay Area musicians to....hopefully in the next year.
        He's also published some books, and stuff. Mostly all out of
        print.</FONT></P>
