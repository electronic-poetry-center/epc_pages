    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">My poor friend, I don't have any compassion
    to give you.<BR>
    Compassion's costly, especially when it's sincere, and on a rainy
    day.<BR>
    I mean, there's a price to be paid for feeling on a rainy day.<BR>
    So let's feel the rain and leave psychology to another kind of
    sky.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">So, it's a sexual preoccupation?<BR>
    But when you're older than fifteen that's indecent.<BR>
    Preoccupation with the, let us say, opposite sex and its psychology,<BR>
    But this is stupid, sonnyboy.<BR>
    The opposite sex exists to be sought after, not to be discussed.<BR>
    The problem exists to be resolved, not to be worried about.<BR>
    Wanting to worry about it is to be impostent.<BR>
    And you shouldn't reveal so much of yourself.<BR>
    &quot;La Col&egrave;re de Samson,&quot; do you know it?<BR>
    &quot;La femme, enfant malade et []&quot;<BR>
    But it's not like that at all.<BR>
    Stop making me feel sorry for you, it's so boring!<BR>
    Look: it's all literature.<BR>
    It comes to us from outside, like the rain.<BR>
    In a way we're pages of novels come to life-<BR>
    Translations, sonnyboy.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">You know why it's so sad? It's because
    of Plato,<BR>
    Who you never read.<BR>
    Your Italian sonnet (you never read Petrarch) came out wrong,<BR>
    And that's just the way life is.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">Roll up the sleeves of your civilized
    shirt<BR>
    And dig in exact soils!<BR>
    That's worth more than bothering with someone else's soul.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="Garamond">We're nothing but phantoms' phantoms,<BR>
    And the landscape isn't helping much today.<BR>
    It's all geographically outer.<BR>
    The rain falls because of natural law<BR>
    And humanity loves because it's been told about love ...</FONT></P>
