          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">This moment, drenched in repetition,
          continued to sound like a machine content with its own operation.
          And I wrote against it because I was determined to follow the
          moment exclusively until I punched through it, until the moment
          could only leave repetition behind, until the machine was teaching
          itself how to operate.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Because he was continually flashing
          violent signs, I had held myself away from him. But the strategy
          of his violence was to camouflage the emptiness enfolding him</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I began to travel in the realms
          of physiology, and my writings reflected a continuous concern
          with a thinking attached to the body.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The possibility of the novel
          is such that the innovation remains at the level of character.
          But the character is not &quot;who&quot; the novel is -- the
          character is how the novel matters, and the language they speak
          applies to their missteps in the world, that the world they write
          is the language that signifies the limits they endure.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My room was lined with windows,
          and the silence of the outside world was soon inextricable from
          the silence with which I surrounded myself when I remained inside.
          But she did not know how truly deafening it was for me while
          I waited.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I was catching up with myself
          by returning, but only as long as I knew I was returning.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We targeted the next day with
          our actions, and our virtuosity, as followers, was revealed through
          those actions, but not because of the day.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I knew that the answer lay somewhere
          within the repetitions I was propagating and promoting. Each
          action within the repetition was a figure of a previous incarnation,
          representing an origin -- and a trail to the origin -- as if
          repeating myself were a kind of incantation, where I summoned
          what I had first experienced.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If it were a novel, the writing
          might have contained other language, but it may have also continued
          to hold back from description in order to show that description
          belonged to the order of the world, whereas this novel sought
          to reveal the law of writing.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He was idle, but then he was
          lethal without knowing where the toxicity began. And there were
          two sections overlaid atop each other, which, when he remained
          idle, he could initially separate for himself. Yet he needed
          more than himself.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Her head towered over me, and
          all my language was lost -- but I do not do this as long as I
          continue to write. And my hands extend out into words, where
          I learn what I mind, and I wait for myself to return among these
          same words.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The image I had attached to
          the moment did not wait for me: it was impatient with the longing
          I felt for it and continued to elude me -- the difference between
          the moment and the image was what separated the act from fulfilling
          me. But I noticed that, as long as the image attained the status
          of a filmed instant (a framed object) inside me, I could continue
          to return to it and the hope that its repetition would bear a
          further outcome, where change signified a perfect acceptance.
          The tone of this conclusion was the same atmosphere surrounding
          the image.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I proclaimed the silence as
          purely accurate. I reacted to the wholeness of her distance.
          Time stretched itself out before me in an open field, and I filled
          it with a silence that I did not enter but which hovered just
          above me, a simulation of what I waited for her to say.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">To protect what was dying in
          me, she fled. And it continued to die, but not enough to be extinguished,
          for her flight promised something -- a slight seduction, a possible
          provocation -- that allowed me to hope I could expand into the
          soft figure of a silhouette.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Suddenly scarcity seemed to
          grow and touch the sky, where I had been waiting to be released
          into a distance I could understand. This happened at the very
          center of the poem I had decided I could not write.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I considered a project like
          this devilish in that I wanted to bring things down from the
          heights, to take words and drop them to the floor, dancing over
          them, wringing the crisis completely out of them. But I was trying
          to do this as a means of accessing what was inside them, where
          light continued to burst forth, through further words, against
          what had previously been silenced.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It seems that it is the present
          that I make most easily. I look up and I see what is in front
          of me before I notice that I am seeing what I have always seen,
          that I am burdening the present with an image that does not belong
          to it, that I, at that moment, do not belong to the present,
          but I have made it captive of what did not originate with me.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Someone had named writing as
          the search for the good among language. But if language began
          with the desire to name something, to distinguish it among a
          context that included others, the good already existed within
          language, for real distinguishing requires the rigor of communication.
          But then, good writing laid the focus back upon the appearance
          of language -- laying itself out as a distinguishing feature
          as form itself. Yet I remained autobiographical because the form
          I wanted to take brought me back towards myself and what I was
          seeking through speech.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We were waiting to be spoken
          to, even if what was being said to us insulted us, as we were
          not sure that anything had ever been said, and we began to doubt
          first the truth and then the function of words altogether. So
          I looked at her and asked her to speak again more slowly. When
          I heard the invectives, I imagined their meanings to be the opposite,
          and I smiled, and I was soothed.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He did not want me to touch
          him, but he did not want me to go untouched.<BR>
<BR>
          That question warned me with its form, which led to the exasperation
          of having to answer something that could only be an indictment
          of the very thing I was readying myself to say.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The silence of the sky so distressed
          me that I could not notice how still the night had become with
          the rain ending in an immobility I called &quot;message.&quot;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">These occasions invigorated
          flowery and ornamental speech, which, in turn, recast the invasive
          events as delicacies, as if there were no actions but instants
          in which things ended all action and remained silent, perfect
          in being silenced by these words.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I heard them arguing about how
          much I had cost them. I later mastered the art of counting, and
          then I saw that the amount over which they had been arguing was
          much smaller than what I needed to survive. I learned the kinds
          of tricks that altered me enough to earn the meaning of this
          scene.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I reached a point in my thinking
          where everything became simple -- objects were objects with names
          because names were needed to distinguish things in speech --
          but the limits were no longer prescribed, as if I had transcribed
          a previously secret language to myself and, upon reading it,
          learned that the language was made up entirely of propositions.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">You were wishing for something.
          You struck out at the air around you. I picked up the shiny object
          beside me and waved it in front of you. You clapped your hands
          together. You intended your movements as happiness.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I spoke the name of the thing
          to evoke it, but the evocation was within me, as the thing did
          not know that I had called it by name, as the name of the thing
          applied to my need to recognize the thing and the function it
          had for me, not to the thing's awareness of itself, as the thing
          had no awareness, but it remained pure function -- the obligatory
          product of fiction.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The finest hour of psychology
          was now upon me. Everything I found myself doing and saying resulted
          in my ability to trace its origin within the first few moments
          I saw her face, when she did not use those words.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We are tied together by a desire
          we pretend not to understand because the convenience of this
          fantasy is the very origin of this same desire, and to lose the
          fantasy is to consciously misplace the energy we use to prolong
          our lives.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The force that a narrator uses
          to turn history into a pure voice that speaks without telling
          is a result of prose's claustrophobia, which packs words tightly
          into paragraphs as a means of stripping the page of space and
          time.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">She reacted as though this moment
          were an acute trauma, that she had lost something that she could
          not find and would never locate, and she looked to me to be responsible
          for the solution. But I sat back and whittled my aggression.
          I knew that this same urgency would repeat itself for her in
          minutes -- and then again.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I thought of the past as a series
          of words on pages, a book whose writing weighed against all the
          air coming in through the open window, and the room that surrounded
          me was in need of a clearing, the very thing I was writing at
          that moment, when the door suddenly began to open.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What prompts me is the very
          thing that moves against me, so I must move in accordance with
          it and learn its every action. Then I will be able to move against
          it in turn by moving through it, watching as it moves away from
          me, until I am no longer moving, but waiting for nothing, acting
          with myself.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Objects and people are interchangeable
          in literary space because both are reduced to the material fact
          of being words and nothing more than words. Writing is the very
          thing a storyteller uses to introduce narrative only at the level
          of language, where history bears out the traces of the people
          who live through it. History brings language forth, into physical
          existence, as though time is an object.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">If I feel silence, I am the
          person who is becoming ready to speak, to let words arise from
          the actions they proliferate -- yet I do not fall into silence
          because I want to speak as a way of giving back to silence the
          jurisdiction of the next word.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The speed of a sentence is carried
          by the weight of its subject; the subject is the speed of its
          action as writing; writing is the action of a subject pulled
          along by the weight of its performance.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I know that a moment will come
          when I will have to do something instantaneous, an action that
          cannot last any longer than itself, and the decision to act will
          be contained by the action (inseparable from it). I will only
          be able to see the decision once the action has ended, when,
          because &quot;acting&quot; is no longer &quot;happening&quot;,
          everything is, only at this point, known to me as something that
          has ceased, that is mute.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Because everything was silent
          outside of them, the clouds seemed to hold that very silence
          within them -- as if I were about to say that the silence began
          with them and radiated outward.</FONT></P>
