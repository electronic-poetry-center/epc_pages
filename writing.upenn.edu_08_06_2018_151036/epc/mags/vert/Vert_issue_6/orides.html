      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Orides de Lourdes Teixeira
      Fontela</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> was born on
      April 21, 1940 in S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o da Boa Vista, S&atilde;o
      Paulo, Brasil. She was licensed in Philosophy by the University
      of S&atilde;o Paulo in 1972, taught philosophy for a time, and
      was a librarian until her early retirement. Her third book of
      poems, <I>Alba</I>, won the Pr&eacute;mio Jabuti, one of Brasil's
      most prestigious literary awards. Bitter, difficult, solitary,
      sickly, she died of tuberculosis exacerbated by alcoholism on
      November 2, 1998. She wrote about 250 poems which were published
      in 5 books between 1970 and 1997.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of this book is the poet's
      own epigraph to her book <I>Alba: A um passo / do p&aacute;ssaro
      / res / piro. Piro </I>is also the<I> </I>1st-person singular
      present of the verb<I> pirar</I>,<I> </I>which is Brasilian slang
      meaning &quot;to split,&quot; &quot;scram&quot;, and &quot;to
      go nuts,&quot; &quot;to flip out,&quot; &quot;to blow one's mind,&quot;
      etc.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orides Fontela might be seen as
      a kind of symbolist. Her &quot;bird&quot; and her &quot;flower&quot;
      have usually been abstracted. I think she means us to <I>see</I>
      (and not merely to <I>read</I>) &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;flower&quot;
      and &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;garden&quot; as quintessential,
      imagic beings--icons, but representing what, if not things-in-themselves?
      I think of Heidegger's strange essays about the thing and how
      we perceive it, and of the ecstatic Islamic poets, with their
      sophisticated iconography of divine love--the eyebrow, the lip,
      the mole on the cheek of the beloved . . . the abandoned encampment
      . . . she was a <I>quiet</I> visionary, was perhaps gnostic in
      her beholding of duality, and can be ecstatic and very, very
      bitter, but it's terribly clear that she was <I>wounded</I>-not
      alienated, but wounded, spiritually, and her work is at least
      partly a way to deal with that wound, which must have had something
      to do with her being born syphilitic into an impoverished and
      illiterate working-class family and being constantly faced with
      literary people who took their educations for granted and who
      for the most part simply weren't her equals as poets-she was
      very much aware of her unique worth.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portuguese language is a very
      good medium for paranomasia. I've done my best with her wordplay
      and her wry, and very sly, humor. But there is one thing I'll
      never solve in translating this poet: she almost never wrote
      the word &quot;eu,&quot; which is the Portuguese word that means
      &quot;I.&quot; She used all the other personal pronouns, but
      the first-person singular personal pronoun is almost never present.
      It will be noticed that there are many instances of the word
      &quot;I&quot; in this translation. These instances are the results
      of direct translations of first-person singular verbs. I feel
      that any attempt to mirror her practice would result in ambiguities<I>
      </I>that <I>do not exist</I> in the Portuguese originals. I ask
      the reader to consider every instance of the word &quot;I&quot;
      to be a deep, insoluble flaw in my translation, and to think
      of that word as silent.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These poems are taken from &quot;One
      Step From the Bird I Breathe In,&quot; a manuscript to be published
      in 2002 by Inscrutable Press.<BR>
