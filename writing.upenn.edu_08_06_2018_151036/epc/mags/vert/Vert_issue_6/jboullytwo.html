         FACE="Trebuchet MS"> In the original production, Boully was
        positioned stage center, the vase contained lilacs, not violets,
        the hills spread out like fallen pears, and ________________
        was originally cast to play the role of _____________________
        who, in the original production, entered on the cue of broken
        glass to ask if she would _________ him. The addition of black
        curtains, which replaced the billowing, transparent ones, was
        made in the year ______. Del Vecchio contends this is indicative
        of Boully's growing apprehension of _____________. The change
        in the set design was intended to symbolize the changes made
        in the dialogue, as __________ would no longer be asking if she
        would __________ him, but if she was okay with just _______ing
        him.</FONT></P>
