        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Winter told me &quot;if you
        have a pinball machine for a body, you better know a little something
        about flippers.&quot; Spring crept up on me slowly to remind
        me I don't have to stay or go inside to find out of business
        sales. Yet summer comes even slower in sweat-stained words to
        remind me I don't have to bike or ride the swings to second its
        motion.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No light but sweltering heat.
        I cannot pass for one who sweats little, but am sick of staying
        in so I let myself look dumpy enough to sit by one of the stranger-trees.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There are times when the brain
        lets the sky be wider than it, when brownstones and trees block
        the skyscrapers the mind circles but cannot contain and I don't
        have to worry about losing my job at a dinner theatre for sweating
        into the customers' coffee And can enjoy being unemployed in
        time for the early heatwave.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's harder to write on a bike
        so I walk to the hilltop playground and do not ride the swings
        just yet, but sit still on the bench without the breeze motion
        makes. Then I wipe my sweat with my shirt, and leave it beside
        me to dry. I'm a little afraid the swings will make me want to
        sing and I should've packed the walkman that records instead
        of the one that plays but does not record to listen to songs
        as I tanned. But I only had room for one and I can't afford one
        that does both yet (unless I would've kept the job that kept
        me inside) and I needed to have room for the notebook and blanket
        and the bottle of water and I'm making use of one and expect
        to use the others (and very excited by and)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My bald spot burning because
        I'm sitting still<BR>
        As if sitting still is to swinging in summer<BR>
        What being outside was to being inside in spring<BR>
        And writing is to singing<BR>
        What sitting still is to swinging or biking<BR>
