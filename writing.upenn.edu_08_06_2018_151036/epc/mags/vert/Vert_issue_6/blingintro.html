        Translated from the Chinese by R.S. Chen</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There was also a young guy from
        China with little glasses. Bei Ling, the young guy, seemed to
        be the group's tour guide. Now that I think of it, he was an
        Asian version of William Blake's Chimney Sweep reincarnate. Yes,
        the Chimney Sweeper Rinpoche. He &quot;taught me to sing the
        notes of woe&quot; for China. He wants a space for more discussion
        in China. We spoke, but his English and my Chinese were not good.
        I did, however, get an address in Boston and an invitation to
        call when I got to Boston. I had just moved from Boston to New
        York, and as these types of things would happen, I did not know
        that I was soon to move back to Boston, having been offered a
        artist's residency at Northeastern University.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Soon after returning to Boston,
        I called Bei Ling. He lived on the backside of Harvard behind
        the Yenching Library and the Divinity School. Coincidentally,
        I road my bike by Bei Ling's street to get to work. We used to
        get together after work. We'd talk poetry. I wanted to talk about
        Li Po and Tu Fu, and he wanted to talk about Robert Lowell and
        Sylvia Plath. He wanted very little to speak of classical Chinese
        poetry, and I had no desire to discuss the Confessionals.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But, we both had little magazines.
        Bei Ling had published <I>Tendency</I> in mainland China, and
        he wanted to continue its publication here in the states. He
        was looking for funding in the US, and we wrote a proposal that
        we sent to the National Endowment for Democracy. The NED was
        generous, which should not have come as much of a surprise. Any
        publishing vehicle that promotes Democracy in China has a good
        chance for NED funding. Meanwhile, Bei Ling kept giving me original
        Chinese manuscripts for <I>compost</I> magazine, the magazine
        with which I was involved. I began learning about the younger
        generation of contemporary poets of China, the post-Misty poets:
        Meng Lang, Chen Dong Dong, Zhang Zhen, et al. <I>Tendency</I>
        publishes independent writers of China and many western writers
        whose works are not allowed to be translated in China: Susan
        Sontag, Vaclav Havel, Allen Ginsberg, Czeslaw Milosz, etc.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The fifth anniversary of the
        Tiananmen Square Massacre was approaching, and Bei Ling was asked
        to read a poem at the Yenching Library's memorial program. He
        asked me if I would translate his poem of exile, &quot;Banishment.&quot;
        I worked with a bilingual journalist who was on work exchange
        at <I>The Boston Globe</I>, Wang Rong. Rong had written a story
        on Bei Ling, and once her superiors at <I>The China Sun</I>,
        China's largest English daily, learned of it, they fired her.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Rong, Bei Ling, and I liked
        the translation, and we began a long process of translation.
        Rong transliterated without altering syntax. She and I would
        talk. I would leave our conversations with questions for Bei
        Ling. He and I would talk. Finally, after I'd become familiar
        with the poem, I recorded Bei Ling reading the poems, and I would
        listen to the poems while looking over my notes over and over
        again. Finally, through some sort of meditative spontaneity the
        poems would come through me. Soon thereafter, Rong and I lost
        touch. The project fell through.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Two summers ago, news arrived
        that Bei Ling had been imprisoned in China again. I knew why
        immediately. He used to publish <I>Tendency</I> in Hong Kong
        and ship them onto the Mainland where he'd get the magazine into
        the hands of Chinese intellectuals. During the spring and summer
        of 2000, Bei Ling decided that it would be cheaper to publish
        <I>Tendency</I> on the mainland. And, it was, but it cost him
        a loss of freedom temporarily. He was caught as he waited for
        the magazines to arrive from the printer at a place where he
        had scheduled an opening with friends and intellectuals that
        evening. The party never occurred, and Bei Ling went to prison
        for two weeks. He was released with the help of international
        pressure from writers and political leaders. When he arrived
        back stateside, I called him to see how he was feeling. First,
        he told me that he was fatigued but grateful to be back in Boston,
        but then he asked, &quot;Did you see the poem in <I>The LA Times
        Book Review</I>?&quot; I had no idea. A friend had sent my poem
        with her open letter to President Jeng Zemin to the <I>LAT</I>.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Bei Ling asked about the other
        translations. He wanted them published. I wanted to find Wang
        Rong. I unearthed the translations. Serendipitously, Bei Ling
        found Rong in London at the BBC World Service Mandarin Program
        studio. Aside from the <I>LAT</I>, the poems have found homes
        on the pages of <I>The New Republic</I>, <I>The Guardian</I>,
        <I>MANTIS</I>, and now -<I>VeRT</I>. --</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000"
