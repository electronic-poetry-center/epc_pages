        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A Scarab shapes the world from
        dung. A language dreams a culture automatically. You thought
        you could pour meaning into this vessel like water but now you
        laugh. Pictures swallow other pictures. Swallows picture other
        swallows. Most chimeras are merely hybrids. Chance. Table of
        the Elements. Make a scene by beating your head against it. Perceptions
        coast. The way there is no choice in pain. Since a mind is based
        in somnolent comfort. Like a story told quietly at evening, this
        seems to spook the world.  Construction surmounting desire. I
        hold this empty spiral seashell that smells like your navel.
        Matter curving its arms around. Frozen energy. Find it.</FONT></P>
