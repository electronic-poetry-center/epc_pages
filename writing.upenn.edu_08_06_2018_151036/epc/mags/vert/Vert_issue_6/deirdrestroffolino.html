        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&gt; Hi Chris,<BR>
        &gt; thanks for writing. i was thinking of writing to you even
        before disaster<BR>
        &gt; struck. you can't imagine what it's like here. at this point,
        i don't even<BR>
        &gt; know what to say. every morning when i wake up i have to
        remember again<BR>
        &gt; that the city is burning and death is on my doorstep. i
        watched the<BR>
        &gt; buildings consumed by flame, black and smoking, and i saw
        the first one<BR>
        &gt; crumble. i was standing on bedford, down by the water, near
        the diner.<BR>
        &gt; grown men were sobbing. i didn't cry until much later. i
        took pictures of<BR>
        &gt; the whole thing. the weather was perfect, and the tides
        were even on the<BR>
        &gt; shore. the water was peaceful; but beyond the water, the
        city was in smoke<BR>
        &gt; and city hall and the brooklyn bridge were barely visible.<BR>
        &gt; yesterday evening i took the J train into the city. it went
        only as far as<BR>
        &gt; delancey, and i got out there with my bike and rode my bike
        through the<BR>
        &gt; city. the streets are desolate. there are police barricades
        all along<BR>
        &gt; canal street, preventing people from going south. thousands
        of cops.<BR>
        &gt; thousands of firemen. constant sirens and flashing lights
        emergency.<BR>
        &gt; people walking desperately with masks on their faces to
        protect from smoke.<BR>
        &gt; i wanted to get further south, so i took a circuitous route
        down chrystie to<BR>
        &gt; get to the water. then i turned south and rode down, parallel
        to the water,<BR>
        &gt; towards the business district. there were virtually no civilians,
        only<BR>
        &gt; thousands of cops and army men in fatigues. there are ravaged
        cars<BR>
        &gt; everywhere, the metal twisted and black, collapsed, and
        fed ex boxes and<BR>
        &gt; computer printouts caught in the tangle. a dense, soft gray
        dust covers<BR>
        &gt; everything. and buildings continue to burn. huge skyscrapers
        are still<BR>
        &gt; burning, black smoke billowing through the sky, smelling
        like burnt plastic.<BR>
        &gt; it hurt my eyes, gave me a headache, made my lungs feel
        dry and hollow.<BR>
        &gt; i rode back to Brooklyn over the Brooklyn Bridge as the
        sun set on the other<BR>
        &gt; side of the city. the sky was orange and gray, phenomenally
        somber and<BR>
        &gt; beautiful. the wooden slats of the footpath on the bridge
        rattled as i rode<BR>
        &gt; on them, speaking the voice of the bridge. a pillar of history
        and<BR>
        &gt; perseverance, the old wood, sitting there for over a hundred
        years, seemed<BR>
        &gt; to watch the disintegration of modernity and technology.
        witness to<BR>
        &gt; apocalyptic destruction. the members of the city struggle
        to harmonize a<BR>
        &gt; beacon of diversity whose apex has been imploded.<BR>
        &gt; in the darkness and in the light, it's hard to know what
        to do.<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; love, Deirdre<BR>

        &gt; ** i may forward this to my family since i haven't written
        to them yet.<BR>

        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; Deirdre---<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I wanted to at least thank you for your email, and let you
        know how it<BR>
        &gt; affects me. Very much so, and I think good (is there anything
        more I can<BR>
        &gt; do?).<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I especially like the way your account becomes very poetic
        in the last<BR>
        &gt; paragraph. I not only can picture you riding over the Brooklyn
        Bridge at<BR>
        &gt; sunset and the sky's mixture of natural beauty and manmade
        destructing, and<BR>
        &gt; the way you manage to find some kind of solace, or focus,
        or hope, in the<BR>
        &gt; rattling of the wooden slats of the bridge's walkway---this
        I feel; you made<BR>
        &gt; (or allowed) me to remember my many bikerides over the bridge
        when I lived in<BR>
        &gt; &quot;the slope&quot; (even once or twice on the way to
        see you, well to Pat's, and<BR>
        &gt; then afterwards over the other bridge to see you and your
        work before band<BR>
        &gt; rehearsal), something I was mildly nostalgic for when I
        moved to<BR>
        &gt; Williamsburg. But it's not just your physical descriptions,
        but the way you<BR>
        &gt; evoke how the destruction around you made the bridge come
        much more ALIVE as<BR>
        &gt; a counterforce to all this unnatural death and destruction.
        Yes, unlike the<BR>
        &gt; WTC, and not just because of the bombing (to the extent
        it's not entirely<BR>
        &gt; accidental that it was the &quot;sore thumb&quot; of the
        towers, that may prove to be<BR>
        &gt; the 21st century &quot;Titanic&quot; [they said she'd never
        go down], as well as<BR>
        &gt; Lusitania, rather than the bridge that was bombed), the
        bridge becomes &quot;a<BR>
        &gt; pillar of history of experience.&quot;<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I hope you don't mind what may seem like a coldly intellectual
        appreciation<BR>
        &gt; of your letter-I doubt I'd be writing this way if I was
        still in Brooklyn, at<BR>
        &gt; least not yet.<BR>
        &gt; I also hope you don't think I'm in any way justifying the
        bombing (as some<BR>
        &gt; have claimed in response to a draft of a poem I prematurely
        sent out on a<BR>
        &gt; poetry listserv). I'm not. But, I am thinking about that
        emblem you found in<BR>
        &gt; the bridge, and I just can't imagine that you would have
        found a similar<BR>
        &gt; emblem in the WTC had they been in each other's &quot;shoes,&quot;
        I mean, had the<BR>
        &gt; bridge, and not the towers, been destroyed (the bridge,
        by definition, less<BR>
        &gt; likely to be a terrorist's target; the bridge more likely
        to be destroyed by<BR>
        &gt; 'nonhuman nature').<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I hope my metaphors aren't getting away from me here; I
        mean, I can't humanly<BR>
        &gt; embrace the flippant wit that would render the WTC Towers
        into wisdom teeth<BR>
        &gt; extracted, etc, however aesthetically appealing such an
        image may be, for a<BR>
        &gt; second at least. There is, sometimes, in me, a rift between
        these two I need<BR>
        &gt; to investigate, in hopes of bridging.<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I also like that you give (or find in) the bridge EYES as
        well as a voice. In<BR>
        &gt; this, like an updating of Hart Crane's THE BRIDGE, and,
        for me (of my<BR>
        &gt; historical time in this), much better because the bridge
        is NOT an emblem of<BR>
        &gt; &quot;modernity and technology&quot; as it was too much
        for Crane (though some would<BR>
        &gt; argue that even in Crane, the real bridge he was concerned
        with was not the<BR>
        &gt; actual, physical, Brooklyn one, on which Sonny Rollins would
        later try to<BR>
        &gt; develop a new sound, but a metaphorical, or symbolic, one
        BETWEEN &quot;modernity<BR>
        &gt; and technology,&quot; on one hand (or shore), and &quot;history
        and perseverance&quot; on<BR>
        &gt; the other.<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; Uh, maybe I'm babbling in the face of tragedy-from my distance,
        and I don't<BR>
        &gt; expect that such intellectualizations could provide any
        comfort for you, but<BR>
        &gt; it's my hope that you won't scorn them either---because
        all I'm really trying<BR>
        &gt; to say, on one level, is I very much admire the strength
        of YOUR character<BR>
        &gt; that comes through in your description of the bridge with
        voice and eyes, in<BR>
        &gt; part because another poet, Auden, in a poem at least 6 people,
        in different<BR>
        &gt; contexts, either spoke of to me, or sent as an email, &quot;September
        1, 1939,&quot; as<BR>
        &gt; being especially relevant to this past week's events (even
        down to the time<BR>
        &gt; of year), talks about &quot;blind skyscrapers,&quot; blind
        even when they're standing;<BR>
        &gt; and such blindness can also, too often, blind us to the
        beauty (even in<BR>
        &gt; horror and tragedy, as you, with your painter's sensibility,
        evoked, even in<BR>
        &gt; words, and BY THE WAY, if you want to send them to me, I
        want to see those<BR>
        &gt; photos you took, but also, and even more, am eager to see
        the paintings that<BR>
        &gt; you'll hopefully be doing in the next several months.and,
        when I get more<BR>
        &gt; money, well.) of nature as seen in the sky, which becomes,
        in Crane, merely<BR>
        &gt; A &quot;riptooth of the sky's acetylene.&quot;<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; Hey, do you know that Auden poem? If not, I'll include it
        and send it to you.<BR>
        &gt; I'll eschew more thorough commentary on it for now---for
        I may have already<BR>
        &gt; said too much-but one more thing.I also love your penultimate
        sentence, &quot;the<BR>
        &gt; members of the city struggle to harmonize a beacon of diversity
        whose apex<BR>
        &gt; has been imploded.&quot; I think that describes perfectly
        what so may of my other<BR>
        &gt; New York lovers and/or friends have been expressing to me
        through email and<BR>
        &gt; phone calls (especially Gary, Miriam, and Mike).<BR>
        &gt; But you put your finger on the feeling (that, misdirected,
        alas, by the<BR>
        &gt; media, finds, or renders, that Beacon in Bush or the Flag,
        or Auden's<BR>
        &gt; uncanny &quot;ironical (thousand) points of light&quot;---such
        a &quot;beacon&quot; seems more<BR>
        &gt; like the towers than the bridge, even in its stereotypical
        gender<BR>
        &gt; associations.)<BR>
        &gt;<BR>
        &gt; I believe, by contrast, you've found that beacon in the
        bridge, the bridge<BR>
        &gt; one with the sky and water it sees, the bridge you felt
        course through you<BR>
        &gt; like what some would call a &quot;corresponding breeze&quot;
        as if maybe you, too,<BR>
        &gt; could be its ambassador amidst the anger and fear, the unmentionable
        odour of<BR>
        &gt; death, and the &quot;conservative dark&quot; whose notions
        of private property (as<BR>
        &gt; Auden puts it) get in the way of &quot;universal love.&quot;
        The bridge, too, more<BR>
        &gt; truly democratic and open to the public than ever the WTC
        was (again, please<BR>
        &gt; don't think I'm sanctioning or justifying the bombing, only
        to say that out<BR>
        &gt; of this tragedy I see you more acutely aware---ON A VISCERAL
        LEVEL---of a<BR>
        &gt; counterforce of &quot;universal love&quot; in the bridge
        than maybe you, or I, could<BR>
        &gt; have seen in it BEFORE the tragedy struck (I also slightly
        fear this may<BR>
        &gt; sound a little corny)). A bridge, in its horizontality,
        can help &quot;undo the<BR>
        &gt; folded lie&quot; of the vertical towers and cities (Dylan
        on New York in<BR>
        &gt; '62-&quot;buildings going up to the sky; people going down
        the ground.&quot;) without<BR>
        &gt; having, or even wanting, to destroy them, except perhaps
        in &quot;the mind.&quot; You,<BR>
        &gt; Deirdre, are obviously no terrorist! but are more truly
        effecting a<BR>
        &gt; transformation terrorism which the kind of war Bush may
        be gearing up for, can<BR>
        &gt; only, at best, parody---as they go about destructively mistaking
        &quot;enterprises<BR>
        &gt; of great pit(c)h and moment&quot; for action in a symbolic
        world.<BR>
        &gt; Your bridge, for me, is far better, also, than what Auden
        seems to hope for,<BR>
        &gt; &quot;an affirming flame,&quot; (recent events show the
        flame to be pretty damn<BR>
        &gt; negative), even though he means love, rather than that which
        consumed the<BR>
        &gt; buildings but that, luckily, was too weak to consume you,
        in body and in<BR>
        &gt; mind!<BR>
        &gt; Thank you, Deirdre. You've helped me find some beacon of
        strength. I hope we<BR>
        &gt; can talk soon (I did try, but can't get through to Brooklyn,
        even though I<BR>
        &gt; can to some of Manhattan).<BR>
