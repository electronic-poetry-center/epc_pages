      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He who eats the bad mustard<BR>
      has sat in the sunshine too long.<BR>
      It will make his brain sleep like a lotus<BR>
      while siroccos caress his boots<BR>
      and his girlfriend crushes shiny<BR>
      beans between two large stones.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He will have to return the long
      yellow<BR>
      parka to Patagonia and get back<BR>
      in his 4-Runner, buckle up and go home.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But he who drinks the cold honey<BR>
      will feel his brow untie, and his mind <BR>
      will begin to roam like a jaguar. <BR>
      He will crave raw octopus, <BR>
      and he will win state track meets <BR>
      after giving a gold watch to his nephew.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He will not need to cash in
      his favorite rug,<BR>
      nor will he have to abandon his Saab<BR>
      on the Great Northern Highway.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">His children will be double
      the number<BR>
      of anyone else's and half the trouble.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My son, it is better to follow
      the path of the righteous man;<BR>
      for his days will be long in the land the Lord has given him.</FONT></I></P>
