        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The first line, for instance,
        of this novel is &quot;Then there was the bad weather.&quot;
         If you happened to be born during a bad weather era, say, the
        Ice Age, then, well, I suppose your pleasure radius went only
        arm's length.  On the plus sideI'm not sure there is a plus side.
          If you were born in any era except the current one, I'm not
        sure there is a plus side.  That is, the third law of physics
        involves Cause and Effect.  The trouble is that cause isn't sufficient
        reason and effect is simply cause one step removed.  Let me put
        it this way: a cause is a cause is a cause.  Never mind Gertrude.
         She always makes me sad because she's dead.  <BR>
