        <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Dear Instructor Kent Johnson:<BR>
<BR>
        I am a visitant Professor to Brown University in the fields of
        Luso-Iberian Poetry, and the Librarian Henry Gould has told me
        about the essay separated into various articulations that you
        are typing on the Internet Listserv called SukSuk. Therefore,
        he shared with myself (through the medium of the electronic mailing,
        consequently my incredible speed) the letter by de Campos to
        Reis that you fragmented for your companions. I am happy to have
        found it. There is a very large amusement park right in front
        of my present lodgings.<BR>
<BR>
        Neverthemore, I must bring forth a correction for you. The letter
        in question is not of the mad author de Campos; it is by the
        diffident Bernardo Soares, a very important distinction to be
        making, I'm sure you would consent to me. <BR>
<BR>
        But my focicle is the following, to share with you the text (fragmented)
        of a letter written to me by another friend of Henry Gould, the
        Professor Edwin Honig, also of Brown University, and honored
        some years ago by my country for his service to my country, awarded
        to a different scholar, by the force of Law, from a different
        country. <BR>
<BR>
        In the end, I do not think he would mind, for poets are always
        roasting their minds on a spit, in any case. Privacy is a hoax.
        Well then.<BR>
        Mr. Honig has said of Fernando Pessoa:<BR>
<BR>
        <I>The stratagem behind such metamorphoses has been tried but
        scarcely probed by modern poets casting off the subjective self
        </I>[by the way, sorry to interrupt, please, but do the Linguistic
        Poets say that they cast off the subjective self also? I believe
        Mr. Gould said to me that they say so]: <I>to cope with estranged
        fragments of poetic identity by making specific dramatic characters
        out of them, occasionally lifted from one's personal life {...}
        The practice also serves to mute momentarily the disquieting
        problem of how to continue in a world inimical to poetic survival:
        Be not one poet but four or even nineteen! </I>[Here, undoubtedly,
        Professor Honig means that a tasking of the poets of avant-gardeness
        is to make forth multiple authors and let them run in the world
        to see what will manifest from them. How referential like a fetish
        to be merely one &quot;real&quot; Author or Academic! Please
        excuse me for my interruptings. My feelings become the best of
        me.]<BR>
<BR>
        <I>When he wrote, 'I am a nomadic wanderer through my consciousness,'
        he was stating the condition of the post-Romantic who, finding
        no model in the past, was left to rummage through his consciousness
        for whatever guidance the search might generate. The sentence
        further implies that the alien 'I' does not belong to 'my consciousness,'
        and hence is detached and something different from the central
        *I*. In pursuit of the other, the wanderer keeps translating
        the inscrutable messages of consciousness by impersonating, as
        translators do, the absent author himself, possibly to achieve
        some affective identification with a fictive self-- perhaps a
        hypothetical former self, perhaps a self-to-be...<BR>
<BR>
        </I>Incidentally, in the light of these reflections, it was interesting
        to myself to attend the Convention of the Modern Language Association
        in Chicago the last year and to sit in a lobby of the Hotel Hilton
        regarding the Professors (I had just come from my room, 19th
        floor, having masturbated a little to relieve the social tension).
        I thought to myself: Is there any hope for poetry other than
        a boring Poetry of Poets? Fashion and circumstance answered no,
        en absoluto.<BR>
<BR>
        I should add, Instructor Johnson, that I understand you have
        poetic readings at your Community University. I also am a man
        of craft, with five authors to my Alexandria of names, and I
        would be honored to come to your village. Anything to get out
        of Providence for awhile, as they say... Or, failing this, please
        let us meet next time you are in this dead and infernal city.
        Let us continue, I hope, a correspondence.<BR>
<BR>
        Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
        Mario de Sa-Carneiro, Ph.D.</FONT></P>
