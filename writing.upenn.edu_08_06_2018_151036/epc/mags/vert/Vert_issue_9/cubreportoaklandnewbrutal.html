        I first attempted to write about Oakland's summer break of poetry
        at the height of summer break: the <A HREF="rubberduckmburger.html">Mary
        Burger</A>/Ron Silliman reading at <A HREF="http://www.21grand.org/">21
        Grand</A> in July. How foolhardy! Everybody knows that nothing
        gets done in the summer. But now it's October and school is well
        underway. In such relative tranquility (<I>I'm</I> not in school)
        I thought it would be easier to answer the question that seemed
        to burn in everyone's mind for at least a moment this year: WHAT
        IS THE NEW BRUTALISM?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was wrong. It hasn't gotten
        any easier. But, to echo <A HREF="http://www.litvert.com/coyoteinterview.html">Kent
        Johnson</A>, I like to sound like I know what I'm talking about,
        which is why I'm leading off with a quote from <A HREF="http://sdpg.blogspot.com/">Bill
        Marsh</A> on assembly poetics. I'm using Marsh's ideas about
        assembly as a balancing tool while I attempt, on a tightrope,
        in a barrel, <I>before your very eyes,</I> to walk us through
        a short history of the New Brutalism. Marsh, not himself a New
        Brutalist, but familiar with the fine art of community org in
        <A HREF="http://www.factoryschool.org/">San Diego</A>, writes:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Humans are meddlesome
        creatures alright and can't get enough of everyone else's 'private'
        information, but we are also fickle and easily distracted. So
        assemblies are short-lived and fragile, tinker-toy cars that
        don't really roll and break apart under the slightest pressure.
        The transfer / translation is always just that, in transit, in
        medias. Assemblies gather and intermix like dust clouds then
        disperse or settle. True, we need better ways to pull this stuff
        together but we are better off that it remains ultimately unassimilable
        and nebulous. We need fewer hard (and hardened) tools and more
        soft assemblies. The uncanny truth of our age is that we are
        all at once desperately alone and intimately connected. The din
        is endless and the silence infinite. Assemblies are perfect forms
        for this time. They materialize for the given particular needs
        of the moment then dissolve into pure potential.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ron Silliman had this to sum
        up about the New Brutalism on his <A HREF="http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_ronsilliman_archive.html#106621649472755246">blog</A>
        last week, as a way to illustrate overlap in his own earlier
        definition of scenes and networks in <I>The New Sentence</I>:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The New Brutalists, for
        example, could be viewed as a scene (younger post-avant poets
        in the Bay Area) with some network connections, especially to
        writers in Massachusetts, although I suppose one could take a
        much narrower genealogical view (former writing students from
        Mills) as well.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">OK. That's also a good place
        to start. Here are the gory details as I understand them. The
        term New Brutalism, in its current literary usage, has been primarily
        associated with a monthly reading series in Oakland started by
        Michael Cross in 2002 and now curated by <A HREF="http://www.durationpress.com/authors/sailers/home.html">Cynthia
        Sailers</A>. Both are alumni of <A HREF="http://www.mills.edu/ENG/eng.gr.html">Mills

        tone as I am?) The New Brutalism is also also associated with
        the following publications:</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Let's get something out of
        the way first: the whole goofy problem of self-naming, which
        rests on the crux of how seriously one takes oneself. The implications
        are similar when considering the purchase of a baby-tee at Ross
        with the words 'bitch' or 'princess' or 'cutie' emblazoned in
        silver cursive writing across the front. Will people think I'm
        trying to look like a teenager (claim membership in a group closed
        to me on the basis of arbitrary restrictions?) Does my personal
        enjoyment of the irony (I'm no princess! I'm no bitch!) rely
        on a viewer registering the disconnect between my identity and
        the shirt's text? Is it clear that I sort of hope I am a cutie,
        that you think I'm a cutie, &amp; that the possibility of a seamless
        relationship between myself and the shirt exists? Is it possible
        to wear the shirt with irony and still be invested in the shirt's
        signage as an aspect of my personality, that is, an expression
        of either sincerity or irony in my daily life?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The problem (or solution) is
        that such shirts are exhausted. They've been around forever,
        in fashion time, and worn by girls and boys in all the ways listed
        above, plus a number of variations and re-combinations. To pull
        such a shirt over one's head now is to shop deliberately within
        the mass market, to step into an echo chamber such as the hall
        of mirrors depicted towards the end of <I>Enter the Dragon</I>.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Here's how I think it happened:
        the term New Brutalism comes up in casual conversation among
        contributors to <I>Involuntary Vision</I>, i.e. &quot;we should
        call ourselves the New Brutalists, ha ha!&quot; Michael Cross
        decides to use the term when he names his reading series The
        New Brutalism. The first few readings are sparsely attended.
        They happen once a month. The audience starts to grow. Thanks
        in large part to an explosion of poetry blogs, the term spreads
        like a freaking virus, leaving ever widening circles of confusion
        (am I a New Brutalist if I read in the series?) excitement (it's
        a literary renaissance!) and hostility (explain yourselves!)
        Those <I>Involuntary Vision</I> contributors who may have been
        joking when they used the term to begin with (witness Geoff's
        alternate suggestion: &quot;INFINITE COCK&quot; and Tanya's coy
        description from the group blog: &quot;a shard of glass, whacking
        off the head of a poppy?&quot;) find themselves called upon to
        articulate a group aesthetic, some philosophical body or theory-based
        alternative to support the thin cotton tee-shirt they seem to
        be wearing. At once, a series of catch-all words are bandied
        about by various individuals: The Lyric, a return to, (non-abstracted,
        non-fragmented), Romanticism, Emotion, and Meaning. By now, it's
        summer break and readings are being added to the series left
        and right to accommodate book releases and the vacation schedules
        of famous bloggers from the East Coast. And like any good virus,
        the first person to catch it in public, Michael Cross, had left
        the room for the Poetics program at SUNY Buffalo by the beginning
        of August. But not before leaving behind the introduction he
        wrote for <I>Involuntary Vision</I>, which just arrived from
        the printer this week. While the position of a reading series
        is always on the move, as fluid as its readers and introductions,
        text is so <I>fixed</I>. I'll be curious to see how this particular
        piece of text is used or not as an articulation of the New Brutalist
        (whatever that may be TM) aesthetic.</FONT></P>

        associated with New Brutalism in the blogosphere (despite his

        might as well enjoy yourself and posted the TOP TEN MYTHS ABOUT

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">1. It's people-the New Brutalism
        is made out of <I>peeeooooppppllllle</I>!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Kasey's joke-list is easier
        to take than any attempts at serious manifesto making because
        it acknowledges the gaping hole at the center of the group's
        identity. In doing so, it comes closest to actually defining
        the New Brutalists, as primarily a social network fitting into
        a general trend in the bay area towards more self-consciously
        social expressions of poetry (witness the recent increase of
        readings in people's homes) but also an inchoate bundle of individual,
        kinisthetic impulses. Trevor Calvert wants to move to Japan!
        James Meetze: the new bard? Julia Bloch writes letters to Kelly
        Clarkson and Buffy! Tanya Brolaski on the high lonesome, medieval
        literature and other forms of country music! <I>It's people &shy;
        the New Brutalism is made out of peeeeooooopppplllle!</I></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I think bay area poets will
        agree that the reading series at 21 Grand is a terrific thing,
        and Michael Cross's energy, organization &amp; promotional skills
        in beginning this series have left, I hope, a long-term mark
        on the east bay. It's been a luxury to drive or walk down the
        street a few short blocks in my own neighborhood to a poetry
        reading, as opposed to the usual navigation of BART or heavy
        traffic at the toll plaza and then getting lost on my way to
        CCAC. I know I'm whining and should cut it out. I live across
        the water from a major literary center. But still, kudos to the
        San Francisco audience members (to say nothing of those from
        Santa Cruz) who have faithfully made the reverse commute to Oakland.

        The New Brutalism readings have generously tried to pair well-known
        poets with younger, lesser known writers, a curatorial focus
        shared by both Michael and Cynthia, bringing together, by default,
        a hybrid audience of younger and older writers. There's been
        a kind of party atmosphere, too, a lot of standing around on
        the sidewalk and chatting, and then hanging out at bars afterwards,
        something I hadn't experienced much of at other poetry readings
        (maybe I didn't know the right people?) Along with readings such
        as those at <A HREF="http://www.litvert.com/dhadbawnik8.html">David
        Hadbawnik's</A> apartment, the New Brutalists have helped to
        invigorate social interactions between poets, no small task given
        the often shy, awkward, belligerent and reclusive nature of poets.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Curiously, the New Brutalism
        coincided with <A HREF="ttp://www.friendster.com/index.jsp">Friendster's</A>
        rise to prominence. Friendster is an online social networking
        database where each user links to their friends or people they
        already know from a local scene. They're then automatically linked
        to a personal network through those friends, and friends of those
        friends, and so on. For instance, I'm linked to 18 friends but
        have a personal network of 223,506 people. My 18 friends are
        mostly poets. Of passing interest are the 'testimonials' at Friendster,
        essentially a blurb of one's friends. Hip to the smuttiness of
        literary blurbing, post-avant younger poets (isn't ANY new, cutesy
        name better than one more label beginning with 'post'?) still
        love nothing better than to employ these forms socially. Writing
        a social blurb-testimonial for your friend instead of their book
        cuts more closely to the nature of the literary blurb to begin
        with. But Friendster is a networking system that still relies
        on certain formal gestures of invitation and request. Users can
        only see or contact people within their own personal network.
        Linking isn't automatic and must be approved by the person being
        linked to.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Blogging dispenses with all
        such waiting around. No permission required when linking to other
        blogs. You can see as far as you can click, and a quick stroll
        through any poet's blogroll will demonstrate the overlap between
        various scenes. Like Friendster, blogging runs in two directions.
        Both systems highlight the connections within smaller scenes
        while opening up a much broader network. Ron Silliman pointed
        to network connections between Massachusetts writers and New
        Brutalists, but blogging is part of what amplified the local
        scene in Oakland and engaged poets in Mexico, New York, Texas
        and <A HREF="http://www.topica.com/lists/PoetryEspresso">Australia</A>.
        And, thanks in part to blogging, Massachusetts New Brutalist
        connections now include <A HREF="http://monkey.onepotmeal.com/">Jim
        Behrle</A>, <A HREF="http://fishblog.blogspot.com/">Aaron Tieger</A>
        &amp; Noah Eli Gordon as well as Peter Gizzi and Elizabeth Willis.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To those more used to the connections
        available through print and online magazine publishing or the
        listserv, blogging is a free for all. You need not submit a sample
        of your work to open a free blog. You won't receive an invitation
        from a moderator to join, nor are you required to write about
        poetry to the exclusion of what you had for breakfast this morning,
        film montage, music reviews, what the 'President' is up to now,
        U.S. OUT OF IRAQ, readings in philosophy and ethics, or morbid
        concentration on the physical attributes of other poets. Because
        anybody can join, because there is nothing to 'join,' bloggers
        may find themselves participating in a social-poetic network
        whose members are of a different class, literary school, race,
        age, nationality, aesthetic preference or gender from their own.
        They may also find themselves more intimately connected to members
        of their local scene.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Like the New Brutalism, there
        are problems with blogging (who has time to read all of this?
        Who has consistent access to a computer and the internet?) and
        with offline or institutional attempts at representation. Every
        generous intention to discuss or preserve the network offline,
        or even to fix it in time and space <I>online</I>, is limited
        in practice in ways that the blogosphere itself is not. For example,
        <A HREF="http://garysullivan.blogspot.com/">Gary Sullivan</A>
        and <A HREF="http://ululate.blogspot.com/">Nada Gordon</A> edited
        an issue of the <I><A HREF="http://www.poetryproject.com/newsletter.html">Poetry
        Project Newsletter</A></I> devoted to blogs, which helped in
        bringing the poetic blogosphere to a wider audience. But even
        the basic structure of a print publication restricts the number
        of bloggers and amount of material that can be reproduced. Gary
        and Nada's introduction to the issue explores other difficulties
        in representing the multiplicity of blogs in print. Similarly,
        the <A HREF="../../../connects/blogs.html">EPC
        posting</A> of <A HREF="http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/">Nick
        Piombino's</A> blogroll (link list) has been fraught with anxiety
        throughout the blogosphere. Nick is one of the warmest and <A
        HREF="http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue4/interviewsv2n4/interviewwithnickpiombino.htm">most
        inclusive</A> poetry bloggers we have, and it's still problematic
        when one blogger's link list becomes the (official, institutional)
        blogroll for one of the largest portals to U.S. and international
        poetry online. And poetry bloggers are just now beginning to
        discuss how the practice of blogging itself (consisting as much
        of reading as writing, and more about hyper links than anything
        else) replicates the hierarchical structures that we experience

        across from someone at their kitchen table, blogging may be the
        best connection tool we have. Prior to the advent of blogging,
        poetry readings were already happening at 21 Grand, a &quot;volunteer-run
        interdisciplinary arts space hell-bent on presenting a macrocosmic
        panoply of emerging and experimental artists, focusing on genre-bending
        and innovative works of visual arts and live art.&quot; <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/twentymule/chasepark.html">David

        particular local (real time) communities but which receded from
        view just as quickly as each performance appeared. Without a
        nucleus of conversation preceding and following these public
        appearances of poetry, it was as if they never happened.</FONT></P>

        wrote to me with a million and one delicious stories about Oakland
        in the 80's not included here - yes, I'm teasing you now because
        I hope to write more about this, because where did Oakland go?
        It is continuously going away. Current luminaries and fashionistas
        aside, I was unfamiliar with many of the names and publications
        he listed. Should I measure the visibility of Oakland's literary
        map and history by my own dimness? Probably not. But as Ben said,
        &quot;how little I've thought about Oakland institutionally.
        It's solely the private residences that defined it for me as
        a poetry city.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Trying to capture or explain
        a local scene made up of private residences and / or infant groups
        such as the New Brutalism is prone to disaster, like baking a
        souffl&eacute;. Trying to do so in Oakland, about Oakland, is
        like baking a souffl&eacute; in Denver. Yet that's been one area
        where blogs excel. The form allows for daily, weekly, various,
        divergent attentiveness to local literary scenes and initiates
        new members into geographically invisible or closed communities.
        Even virtual distances (San Francisco v. Oakland) begin to narrow.
        Blogs also begin to create a public record of that which may
        gone by next year or next week. In this sense, blogs and the
        New Brutalism may be ideally suited to one another.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bill Marsh again on assembly
        poetics:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The logical endgame of
        assembly poetics is that (and this is the best part) it constantly
        disassembles and reassembles itself and thus rarely resembles
        a poetics. Those who have missed or mourned the absence of a
        discernable poetics among the tribe's most recent emissaries
        may do well to consider the &quot;shape-shifting&quot; character
        of today's assembly workers and their associated assemblies.
        If you happen to be at the right place at the right time, you
        may catch a glimpse of what you're looking for, but don't expect
        too much. The vision will be fleeting, an illusion of sorts,
        and what's more the people around you may have an entirely different
        sense of what they just saw, and there will be much excitement
        but little agreement.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Certainly there's been little
        agreement about what the New Brutalism is, and plenty of excitement.
        If it employs DIY methods, if a whole new crop of younger writers
        are publishing one other, paying tribute to their influences,
        providing reading spaces, realizing they can do for their peers
        what they've been waiting around for an authority to confer upon
        them, well, this is nothing new. It's the kind of DIY that gave
        birth to <A HREF="http://www.sptraffic.org/">Small Press Traffic</A>

        the term DIY for a literary group that doesn't fall into a punk

        debate around the group so generative.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When we consider the blog or
        the New Brutalist as alternate forms of assemblage, coherency
        matters less, as does the size or institutional heft of the information
        portal which leads a reader or writer towards either assemblage.
        Indeed, one link to one blog from the EPC would do the trick,
        especially if we as readers continue to click beyond the names
        we recognize. Of equally little importance is my own anxiety
        about Oakland's future as a locus of excitement and activity.
        The potential of the current moment in Oakland this last summer
        fluttered at the shifting intersection of poetry blogs and the
        unsubstantiated banter of New Brutalism. Some shift in the clouds
        was itself blindingly illuminated and a raggedy group with well
        made fliers stood there winking, trying to look cool. At such
        moments, a thin cotton tee shirt may be the best piece of clothing
        to have on.</FONT></P>
