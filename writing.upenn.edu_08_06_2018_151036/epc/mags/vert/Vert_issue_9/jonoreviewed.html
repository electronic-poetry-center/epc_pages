      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The title of Jono Schneider's
      book of experimental prose, <I>&quot;...But I Could Not Speak...&quot;,
      </I>is paradoxical. Isn't the voice that announces &quot;but
      I could not speak&quot; in fact speaking? On closer inspection
      this title seems to enunciate frustration with the standard modes
      of articulation; it seems to say that if a voice speaks in a
      way that satisfies standard expectations for prose, it will fail
      to capture the pulse of contemporary existence. In other words,
      if a voice follows the typical prose patterns of established
      literary work, it will fail to introduce into the dialogue of
      literature the contours of life as it is lived today. Unable
      to speak in these patterns without uttering what is yesterday
      and now false, Schneider thus says, &quot;but I could not speak.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
      In retaliation against the gagging influence of standard prose,
      Schneider announces early in the book, &quot;So I would permanently
      break into sections.&quot; This declaration in effect brings
      into focus the fragmentary aesthetic of his work. Although at
      first glance the work seems to borrow some of its aesthetic from
      Proust, on closer inspection many of its sentences shift midstream
      in a manner that applies a tourniquet to straightforward meaning,
      and the interval or gap between these sentences only adds another
      layer of dislocation. Taken as a whole, these shifts and odd
      combinations of phrases give Schneider work a cut-up and disjointed
      feel that often reminds one of Ashbery. For example, Schneider
      writes, &quot;I suddenly recalled that his philosophy hearkened
      back to the days when the crisis of death set in, formed by smallish
      bombs floating heavily above him until their weight broke him
      open with their fire.&quot; In sentences such as this the relationship
      between particulars--for example &quot;his philosophy,&quot;
      &quot;the crisis of death,&quot; and &quot;smallish bombs&quot;--is
      skewed and unwieldy; it skirts meaning without suggesting definitiveness
      and exudes hyperbolic undertones that give an inflated and ironic
      and thereby somewhat whimsical import to everyday events. It
      is in through sentences of this sort that Schneider strikes one
      of his most resonant notes. <BR>
<BR>
      Many of Schneider's sentences also follow turns of consciousness
      in a mode reminiscent of Blanchot's work, particularly <I>The
      One Who Was Standing Apart From Me</I>. In this mode<I> </I>the
      majority of &quot;action&quot; is mental, interior, or theoretical,
      with an ambiguous &quot;I&quot; meditating on its voice or actions,
      or on the characteristics or actions of a third person, who is
      usually reduced to a &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; (though
      an &quot;Olga&quot; appears toward the end of Schneider's book).
      These features help distinguish Schneider's aesthetic from Silliman's
      New Sentence and its focus on perceiving particulars; they also
      push Schneider's work in a narrative direction, though this direction
      is not necessarily directed. <BR>
<BR>
      In his famous essay, &quot;The Storyteller,&quot; Benjamin claimed
      that sanitized information (i.e. the news hour) has supplanted
      the traditional narrative of the storyteller, and it is into
      this absence--the story's absence--that Schneider commits his
      voice. Instead of telling a seamless narrative or relating an
      epic trajectory, Schneider speaks from a multitude of perspectives
      through use of a fluid and expansive &quot;I&quot; that cannot
      be associated with the author, a stable narrator, or a character.
      In this mode each of his fragments--whether sentence or paragraph--operate
      as a discrete narrative unit. Speech here reminds us of the archipelago,
      where each sentence is an island that introduces us to the immensity
      of an unbounded ocean. The fragments don't necessarily add up
      to a whole, they don't pretend to sum up our context in the world
      today, and yet they speak to our condition. Or do they? As Schneider
      asks:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Georgia">But could inventing sentences
      neither connected to nor comforted by the others surrounding
      them be the answer to the problem of context if context, while
      perceiving the difference between ideas for the sake of democratic
      idealism, spread us out across the fields of interest as a quick
      decision to either accept or decline each other?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In its expansiveness, Schneider's
      &quot;I&quot; reminds us to a certain extent of Blanchot's Bavard.
      &quot;The Bavard... is a mute who gives expression to his muteness&quot;
      writes Blanchot, &quot;his 'I' is so porous that it cannot be
      kept to itself; it makes silence on all sides...&quot; Schneider's
      voice also seems unable to stop speaking, and yet at times, as
      its montage of divergent stories overwhelms the reader, it cannot
      be heard. This, however, seems to be the only possible mode for
      the storyteller in the story's absence. Only a sort of plural
      or neutral speech that says both yes and no, that begins again
      and again, always issuing from the same level compositional field--a
      field that lacks a coherent plot or set of characters--seems
      capable of engaging the reader in a familiar narrative containing
      recognizable characters. Thus, Schneider says about his mode
      of articulation:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Georgia">That it was no longer a novel--a
      voice whose speech did not name the character who spoke it, instead
      letting it issue forth a flow of words attached to the conditions
      that created the story's absence, a space which could not be
      filled by naming the speaker or supplying the author's intention
      to the reader--could only be confirmed by a careful reading that
      did not deliberate over questions of legitimacy.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All in all, Schneider's <I>&quot;...But
      I Could Not Speak...&quot;</I> offers an open work, the type
      of book that can be opened on any given page and read without
      any loss of meaning. Similar to Hejinian's <I>Border Comedy</I>,
      it &quot;has no horror of dispersal.&quot; Each fragment unfolds
      a new story that ends where the next fragment begins. It is as
      if Blanchot spoke of Schneider's sentences when he wrote:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Georgia">[W]hile they are interrupted
      by a blank, isolated and dissociated to the point that one cannot
      pass from one to the next--or only by a leap and in becoming
      conscious of a difficult interval--they nonetheless convey in
      their plurality the sense of an arrangement they entrust to the
      future of speech. <BR>
      </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
      Although many of Schneider's sentences contain turns that frustrate
      understanding, the difficulty of these turns should be understood
      as necessity; only new arrangements of words can suggest new
      meanings and possibilities, and thereby transform a book into
      &quot;a written lantern which uses letters to light the path
      of future progress.&quot; Any difficulty that arises from these
      new twists and turns should be seen as intrinsic to the task
      of giving the reader some glimpse at the future of speech and
      narrative, in all its fragmented plurality.</FONT></P>
