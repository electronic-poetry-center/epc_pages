      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Certain databases are called
      &quot;cubes&quot; even though they have an arbitrary number of
      dimensions.  The cube that we budget with has eight.  The covered
      pops cube has two.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But the dimensions I'm really
      thinking of are those of his ass.  Like a woman's.  Huge hips
      to hang on to.  Maybe it's the peppermint schnapps talking, but
      something tells me to pull the Gideon Bible out from under the
      yellow pages and start preaching.  Just open it at random, let
      the words spill right out into the open air.  I've never seen
      him laugh so hard.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;You can do it again,&quot;
      he says a few days later.  So I pull out my penis and flap it
      up and down at the camera like it's waving goodbye.  I think
      he'll be really proud of me, and that my parents will be proud
      of me too.  It's just that I always blink when the shutter's
      open.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Did you know there are
      bombs all over your house?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Where?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;The furniture.  Look.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">We slide like mechanics under
      a puffy living room chair.  A layer of rough, translucent gauze
      brushes our noses.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;There.&quot;  He points
      to a tiny white cocoon at the intersection of three pieces of
      wood then hands me his pocket knife.  The plastic handle's warmer
      than my fingers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;You've gotta diffuse it.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;I can't.  The furniture--&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Want your parents to die?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I make a tiny incision in the
      gauze.  Little shudders crawl up my arm as the blade stretches
      every fiber past its breaking point.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;Give it to me.  You don't
      know what you're doing.  Watch.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">By the time he finishes it's
      winter and the trench he dug for the coy pond has filled up with
      snow.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;How had you intended to
      keep the fish alive?&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">&quot;They're stronger than
      you think.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">So we substitute glassy stones
      for sod.  Who likes sod anyway?  Just replant a couple of those
      trees you uprooted and run a coy pond around the edges.  Put
      the tables in the middle, with arched wooden bridges connecting
      the island to the &quot;mainland&quot;.  Perfect for weddings
      and corporate luncheons where the only open seat is next to the
      fascist.  Although it's clear he's a fascist from conversation
      alone, the butter -- melted like transparent lip gloss onto the
      outward curve of his bottom lip -- really gives him away.  He
      never completely closes his mouth, so his lip just keeps on reflecting
      the fluorescent tubes overhead.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A couple of things to keep in
      mind: that there are 50 fish in the pond isn't as important as
      the fact that someone had to count them.  Also -- each of those
      three pieces of wood is at a 90-degree angle to both of the others.
       (In a two-dimensional universe, this would be impossible.)</FONT></P>
