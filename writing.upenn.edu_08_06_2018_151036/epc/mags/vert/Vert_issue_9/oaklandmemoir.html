        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Je confesse! I lived in Oakland
        from February to June, 1971. I was then a young poet and my own
        reasons were simple or maybe, even, complex. I grew up in Richmond.
        Oakland is the Capital of Richmond, Vallejo and Pittsburg - each
        of the other and smaller East bay industrial port towns made
        large during World War II, remaining so up until the seventies,
        at which time most of the large industries began to withdraw.
        Unlike San Francisco's cosmopolitan reputation, or Berkeley with
        it's University population, each of these smaller towns are/were
        predominantly southern and southwestern working class, with large
        &quot;poor white&quot; and black populations. I once visited
        Selma, Alabama and thought I was in another version of Richmond.
        However, to be fair, Richmond was not entirely bereft of &quot;high
        culture&quot; aspirations. Up into the fifties the high school
        remained a strong magnet for UC Berkeley; the Art Center was
        well known for its ambitious shows of new and contemporary artists.
        In 1962, I remember being knocked out, caught visually totally
        off-guard there in a gallery space filled with several of Jasper
        Johns' series of American Flag paintings. Walter DeMaria &shy;
        the eventual creator of The Lightening Field &shy; was my &quot;Y&quot;
        camp cabin counselor and an upper-classman at Richmond High School.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Oakland, however, always had
        a sense of style that was part City and part not. Even in the
        relatively new Oakland Museum - which, in its modest way, is
        actually one of the architectural wonders of the West - the staff,
        behind the desks, was pure Oakland, with barely a whiff of Ivy
        League privilege. Yes, Oakland was/is a very classy version of
        Richmond. I wanted to get a fuller sense what that really meant
        before moving back into the City where I was then teaching creative
        writing and Humanities classes at the Art Institute. In fact
        my spring classes included one called, &quot;Post War Poetry
        and Painting in the Bay Area.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Oakland - dating back to the
        post-1906 earthquake exodus from San Francisco - had the historical
        reputation of up-in-the-hills real wealth. In fact, the town
        became one of the primary centers of turn of the Century California's
        Arts &amp; Crafts movement which created a history of cultural
        assets and developments, including the fanciful zoo, a modern
        arts museum, Mills College, California College of Arts &amp;
        Crafts, the Society of Six (the Region's first modernist painters)
        Isadora Duncan's school of dance, renowned architects of beautiful
        homes and institutions, for example, Julia Morgan, whose works
        were supported by small, crafted oriented factories. (Think,
        for example, painted ceramics, or tiles for porches, stairways
        and fireplaces.) Originally it's new inhabitants envisioned its
        hills and neighborhoods as the re-creation of Arcadia.<BR>
<BR>
        By the Thirties, its lower flatlands with the railroad terminal
        and port became renown as the home of wealthy industry and blue
        collar jobs. Kaiser was king - builders of the Hoover Dam, the
        World War II Richmond Shipyards - among much, much more, Kaiser
        Industries was the town's major cultural benefactor, as well
        as the area's probably largest working class employer. Kaiser's
        high rise home office building sat on the edge of Lake Merritt,
        a stones throw from City Hall, the downtown, and offices of the
        arch conservative Oakland Tribune. Oakland - which is part of
        Alameda County - was then the career building site for Edwin
        Meese and several other Republicans who - starting in 1976 -
        became prominent, reactionary figures in President Ronald Reagan's
        Administration. Oakland was very hardball underneath. It was
        no surprise that the City would spawn the birth of the Black
        Panther Party.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">However, I didn't move to Oakland
        for culture capital &quot;C&quot;, nor to be in the grip of its
        conservative politics. I lived on Stow Street, in a studio apartment,
        a couple blocks up a hill from the eastside of the Lake. In truth
        I wanted to live in Oakland to be close to a kind of style -
        to eat at those still fifties' era diners where the white waitresses
        all had the highest blond bouffants I have ever seen, &quot;Fresno
        bouffants&quot;, (I think that's what they were called). I wanted
        to hear the country accents, black and white, and the music coming
        from both sides of a racial divide (Buck Owens on one, Josh White
        and lots of black Blues the other), and to see people still driving
        soup't up fifties and sixties cars. That part of me was probably
        homesick for something deeply present &shy; an &quot;up south&quot;
        in the Richmond in the Fifties. My older brother - proud owner
        of a royal blue, 1953 Chevrolet Coupe with 28 coats of lacquer
        outside and inside, soft baby-blue, tuck &amp; roll Tijuana crafted
        leather upholstery - courted Lucy, the runner-up for Miss Oakland
        in 1958. If I remember she had a blond bouffant, not to forget
        to mention an eye-full of cleavage, too.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In actuality, Oakland in 1970,
        when I think about it, was much closer to the entire country's
        cultural and political heat. At that time everything had a black
        riff. National consciousness was focused on either the rural
        South - Atlanta, Mississippi and Alabama - or the racially mixed,
        big northern industrial towns, say Detroit and Chicago. Oakland
        possessed a local sense of both. Race was on everyone's mind,
        infusing speech, music, the shape of politics. The Black Panthers
        - Huey Newton was by then living in a tower apartment overlooking
        the Lake - and the music, Motown (Aretha, the Supremes, etc.),
        Tina &amp; Ike, Ray Charles, and, locally, Sly &amp; The Family
        Stone, and Tower of Power and so many others were banging and
        melodizing in everybody's ears. The dichotomies of Oakland were
        a microcosm of the country. Much more on target, it was almost
        more fashionable to be in Oakland rather than in San Francisco.
        The City's bedrock Irish, Italian, and Chinese folks, its then
        still large new Central American population, the aura of Latin
        Catholicism, did not ring the same bells, nor quite yet fit the
        black and white cultural scope.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Except for Nanos Valoritis,
        the Greek via Paris Surrealist - who taught at San Francisco
        State - few poets then lived in Oakland. Ishmael Reed - if he
        had yet arrived - had not made Oakland, or what hip blacks called
        &quot;Jump City&quot; into a multi-cultural literary project.
        Omit Ishmael from Oakland today and expect weird, paranoid voodoo
        to track you into both your previous and your next life, to say
        nothing of off-spring and kin! I would not meet Ishmael until
        later in the early-Seventies when poetry in San Francisco, including
        new and diverse ethnic voices - Jessica Hagedorn, Ntozake Shange,
        Thulani Davis, Roberta Vargas, Alejandro Murgia and Victor Hernandez
        Cruz &shy; would begin to reshape the City's cultural shape,
        an important fact often ignored in the histories of the emergence
        and power of the slightly later, still young Language poets.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But absolutely no scene in
        1970 Oakland - at least one that was readily evident. Sitting
        on a bench on the edge of Lake Merritt could be mighty lonely,
        especially if you were looking for a familiar face, be it poet
        or artist. In fact that spring, while teaching the class on Bay
        Area poetry and art - an experience that had me devouring volumes
        of Rexroth, Jeffers, Everson, Duncan, Spicer, Adam, Whalen, Snyder,
        Welch et al - it was also starkly evident that none of the work
        had any resonance with or location in Oakland. The City was a
        poetry zero zone. As a poet, it was hard to get a grip on a place
        that seemed to have no contemporary or recent ancestry off of
        which my work could bounce.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But that's not to say there
        wasn't poetry in Oakland once, or there was not the possibility
        of more!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Joaquin Miller, an internationally
        famous late nineteenth century poet - &quot;Song of the Sierras&quot;
        - lived up in the Oakland hills in a house with a separate writing
        studio located off what is now Miller Drive. Then considered
        California's first poet laureate, he is a terrible poet, but
        his repetitiously sublime evocations of wilderness led to success
        in the East and Europe. Actually his novel, Years Among the Modocs,
        is a wonderful depiction of the 1860's Indian wars around Mt.
        Shasta. In a way, Miller's early western life style created the
        tradition-preamble for the later mountain living legends and
        poems of Kenneth Rexroth and Gary Snyder.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">During my six months in Oakland,
        I was involved with a woman whose father owned a jazz and rock
        &amp; roll record shop downtown on 13th &amp; Franklin. In the
        fifties and early sixties, I learned from her that Juanita Miller,
        his infamous daughter, poet, silent movie actress, and contemporary
        of Isadora Duncan, still lived in the main house. As a movie
        actress, one of her famous hours occurred in Virginia City where,
        as the story has it, in the early Twenties she was starring in,
        I believe, a Western. It was noon. Juanita was early on into
        astrology. At lunch she climbed up and spread herself out - limb
        to limb- in the crown of a tree. When the Director called her
        to get back to work, she called down that she would not be back
        on set until she had finished having &quot;intercourse with the
        sun.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Later, in her eighties, and
        living in her father's house, Juanita would host visiting groups
        of boy and girl Scouts, as well as school groups. She would first
        talk in the main house about the life and romantic exploits of
        her once famous father. A charming host, she would then take
        the Scouts into her father's cabin where he lay in bed, propped
        up on his elbow, writing a poem in one of his journals. Joaquin,
        of course, was faux, a dressed up plaster-of-Paris mannequin.
        There in the Oakland hills, Juanita had created her own theme
        park for California's first poet laureate. Jaunita's and Joaquin's
        names. by the way. both bear an Anglo respect for the <I>Californios</I>,
        ironically the first California colonialists. Peralta was the
        family name of the Mexican family with the land grant that extended
        from San Jose up the East Bay into Berkeley. The University of
        California was to have been named &quot;Peralta&quot; until some
        of the University's Anglo Christians elevated Bishop Berkeley's
        imperial pronouncement &quot;westward the way of Empire&quot;
        into a &quot;he's our boy&quot; nominal coup. It was not until
        the Seventies that Oakland named &quot;Peralta&quot; to one of
        its new community colleges.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Actually one of my favorite
        stories and one to do with a name of a now famous song with its
        origins in Oakland. Hudie Ledbetter, the singer, known in his
        lifetime as &quot;Leadbelly&quot; had an aunt who lived in Oakland.
        Once in the Thirties, he was on his way by train to Hollywood
        for a recording session. He got off the train in Oakland to visit
        and have dinner with his aunt. When it was time to leave and
        catch the night train down the coast, she let him out the front
        door on to the porch; he gave her a hug and said, &quot;Goodnight,
        Irene.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When he got down to the bottom
        of the stairs, he looked up and said, &quot;Irene, I reckon the
        next year hear that, it will be on record.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A black man, Jim Battle, from
        Shreveport, Louisiana told me that story in the early sixties
        in Richmond where I had a summer job as a City gardener. That
        was way back at the start of the Folk Music revival and the rediscovery
        of Leadbelly's music of which I was an enormous fan. Battle also
        said he had courted Leadbelly's sister, in fact &quot;Watched
        Hudie crack one of several guitars over the head of a night club
        patron because he wouldn't take shit off anybody.&quot; When
        Battle told me that I trusted his authority and still totally
        believe the &quot;Good Night, Irene,&quot; story, though I have
        never heard or read it anywhere else. Leadbelly's commitment
        performing his art &shy; going as far as to sacrifice an instrument
        to protect it &shy; also made a deep impression.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's strange how writing about
        Oakland keeps bringing up stories and associations, ones that
        I find much more interesting than anything that happened to me
        while I lived there so shortly. Just now &shy; when I was about
        10 or 11 years old - I can remember seeing &quot;The African
        Queen&quot; at the Paramount Theater in 1952. Inside that dark,
        Art Deco monument - probably one of the most beautiful theaters
        in the West &shy; watching Bogart and Hepburn afloat on their
        boat going down and stopping to swim in the Nile, I will never
        forget the dark leaches intractably attached to Hepburn's legs
        while Bogart applied and rubbed white baking powder to her flesh,
        trying his best to release the creatures back into the river.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Paramount Theater, in my
        experience, it seems, has always been host to real African Queens.
        I saw the Labelle Sisters - dressed as black leather butterflies
        - tear up the audience about 1975, and then Nina Simone, who
        gave her last Bay Area concert there just a couple of years back.
        I can never forget her response to the woman fan who yelled out
        from far back in the audience, &quot;Nina, I love you. You saved
        my life.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;If I did that, honey,
        you owe me a lot of money.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I am also happy to report &shy;
        unlike thirty years ago - poetry, with readings and new presses
        and many, many poets is more than ever before thriving in Oakland.
        There, Gertrude!</FONT></P>
