      </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Where the Elect Get Lost</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Under<BR>
      white lights he stood at<BR>
      the edge of<BR>
      the stage and of command, gasping about<BR>
      his fantastic demons. Then he blew dust over<BR>
      audience-heads and floated into<BR>
      power.	</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I talked
      to <BR>
      him in the greenroom about<BR>
      his victory. What did he hide under<BR>
      his fingernails? What did he throw at<BR>
      his crowd of<BR>
      enemies-how did he win them over?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The contest was over. <BR>
      And I began to understand the dangerous pull of<BR>
      the man. He had just coaxed us to<BR>
      sleep. It was all about<BR>
      sleep-a hypnotist, taking us under<BR>
      was what he was good at.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">He was also good at<BR>
      persuasion.  As I was about <BR>
      to leave, he talked me into<BR>
      going with him-out the door, and over -<BR>
      land, into the forest. I was under<BR>
      the impression, this wasn't a thing I could get out of.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Then I knew what he was capable
      of--<BR>
      too late-blurry dust, not magic. Under<BR>
      a dark moon and stars that had turned to<BR>
      masses of lint, he pointed his gun at<BR>
      me. Then came to me. With a rock, he knocked me over<BR>
      and then commenced to pound my eyes out.<BR>
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The stars weren't about <BR>
      to amass in shield over<BR>
      me.  A shot bangs into <BR>
      the forest floor in the United States of <BR>
      America. As a sea of dirt clots at <BR>
      the edges of my mouth, I go under.<BR>
       <BR>
      I was, at once, about, and into, the gun. <BR>
      I was now over and under <BR>
      the gun. Of gun and loss, gun won.<BR>
