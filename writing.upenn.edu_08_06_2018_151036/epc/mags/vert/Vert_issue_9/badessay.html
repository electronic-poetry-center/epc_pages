        <B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Bad Essay, circa September

        2002- Written in email, intitally in response to a question from

        a reporter, Sam, from The Chronicle, a San Francisco Newspaper:</FONT></B><FONT

<BR>

        Hello Sam,</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As with all major movements

        and genres in art and literature, inasmuch as these are characterized

        by variety, conflict, and change, it is impossible to come up

        with definitions that cover all cases and examples. However,

        when one sees it, it is unmistakable-- Nothing quite succeeds

        like &quot;The Bad.&quot; In some ways Bad Poetry is a scavenging

        through the rubble of one's self, and through our cultural heritage.

        A way of assessing our norms and hang ups and pathetic socially

        regressive leftovers without the competitive sense that poetry

        is going on, that we are being spiritually measured and called

        to account by the master author/speaker. It is a welcoming environment,

        as I am sure you can attest to at the reading. Things were loose,

        and, unlike many readings, the emotional register varied, if

        a bit obtuse. In a very real way, the Bad Poetry reading was

        more participatory and democratic and contained a possibility

        that anything might indeed happen. There was comradely in the

        crowd which is often absent at *normal* poetry readings. Perhaps

        this has to do with the particular space poetry inhabits in the

        U.S.A.? A semi-cult cottage industry almost entirely marginalized

        within the biosphere of entertainment media -- And the participants

        like it that way, for the most part -- but it's nice, to use

        a word, to laugh at yourself through all the bad work. (Which

        was oft times just so sincere it hurt, and unaware of itself.

        May heaven smile down on, oh what's her name, Susanna Summers,

        and her gloriously awful poetry.)<BR>

<BR>

        But my thoughts toward the bad in <A HREF="../Vert_issue_7/issueseven.html">issue

        #7</A> of VeRT, which, importantly, also includes the themes

        of Homage and Imitation) had more to do with examining assumptions

        and attempting to get at new expressions.<BR>

<BR>

        The Bad is an old avant-garde device. The new is often mistaken

        for the bad. This search for the bad can also illuminate a way

        toward a new form of sincerity. A new form of expression. Punk

        rock was this sort of phenomenon. An aggressively cryptic plunge

        into a counter argument in desperate search for new ways of being

        real. In one sense the bad is a purposeful turn into the ill-reality

        of being, which is our present condition. (And I do not mean

        that things are so horrible, etc. that we can hardly stand it,

        but that we are so mediated, so aware of our selves and possible

        motives-- so self-conscious, that the bad is in its own way a

        turn into the unreal self-conscious aspect of our selves that

        actually frees us up to be who we may also be, liberated from

        the pretense of the good, which is often just the same unquestioned

        aspects of the status-quo.)<BR>

<BR>

        The question is how to explode the dream? Art relies on the bad

        to expose new ground and question assumptions. But what does

        the Bad mean, when everything is bad in advance? How do we crawl

        out from under the invisible oppression of the good, when all

        there is is bad? Nothing succeeds like the bad, and everything

        is bad in advance. What does this mean culturally. Pop Art is

        about liking things, Andy Warhol said. So what is the bad? Liking

        bad things? How can art compete with the versions of soft-core

        pornography being pumped into our homes via the television and

        songs full of base gimmicks which we feel somewhat ashamed over

        for liking? How do these bad things become the wallpaper of our

        lives... And how aware are we to it? One thing for sure -- it

        can only get worse. That is the resigned national consensus,

        and so why not try to head it off at the pass? That is a question

        some artists may be asking themselves.<BR>

<BR>

        As for the W. Whitman quote-- I actually felt a little bad over

        reading that only because I didn't want it to come off like I

        was somehow implying that loving the smell of men's armpits is

        somehow wrong. Far be it for me to tell another person what their

        deep abiding pleasure should be. But I think that you're right,

        if it had been me who had uttered those words without the Whitman,

        it would have almost brought the house down., that was truly

        bad timing on my part. But because it was Whitman I think there

        were political considerations that, while not intended to arouse,

        where there in the back of my mind, and perhaps others. But I

        understood the spirit in which I was providing the line, and

        felt had it been a regular schmoo, or old Walt himself there

        smiling behind his beard, it would have been a welcomed light

        moment of intentionally great bad poetry.<BR>

<BR>

        And that is really the thing about poetry. It is almost always

        bad in some part, so why not turn into it and write something

        so bad that it is almost a new thing... a thing which can stand

        up to the pratfalls and indecencies of this world.<BR>

<BR>

        As for entertainment value, yes I suppose it is entertaining.

        I would like it if the bad tag were somehow lost and it were

        to acquire another title, though what I am unsure. Bad just seems

        too final and unbending, though I understand it to be not so.<BR>

<BR>

        Let me know if this is of any use. Sorry to go manifesto on you.

        Please continue to visit the site. <BR>

        Best of luck with <A HREF="badtofunny.html">the article</A>.

        Andrew -<BR>

<BR>

        I think it's interesting that the bad, in your examination of

        it, is actually a device for locating very real things in the

        world -- what it is we think; what it is we do; how it is we

        judge; and how, ultimately, to approach the world we are in.<BR>

<BR>

        I've been thinking about this a lot, though not consciously.

        Like how my mind works behind everything I'm doing, and I just

        have to attend to it. But my life is very regular -- not at all

        that of the cliche of the free artist who doesn't have to get

        up or go to bed at any time, who eats pumpkin seeds and pretzels

        for breakfast, and who generally operates according to his/her

        own laws. And the world be damned, even as the artist celebrates

        it.<BR>

<BR>

        I mean, I go to work everyday, I wear a tie, and I take lunch

        at the same time, take a walk to the same place at lunch, etc.

        It's a routine. And it's boring, but somehow invigorating, too.

        Like I know that there's no end to the world even when I tread

        the same ground. <BR>

<BR>

        But the most important part of this -- and what leads me to the

        bad -- is something new; that I don't hate what's in front of

        me, nor do I fetishize the oddness of the regular like I once

        did. I don't need to stretch reality in order to meet it and

        wake myself up. <BR>

<BR>

        The bad can be too easy -- like the &quot;its so bad its good&quot;

        section of the video store, or the campness of John Waters, or

        gossip columns. But the problem, as I see it, with these definitions

        of the bad, is that they are simply a way of succumbing to the

        real. The &quot;if you can't beat 'em, join em&quot; sentiment.

        There's nothing to beat here, though. <BR>

<BR>

        Yes, many experiences in American culture -- the mall, for example

        -- are predetermined and mundane. But the concern with hating

        them is the concern for some sort of authenticity that precedes

        experience altogether. That experience is measured by something

        outside of itself that determines it for me -- I would cast my

        vote for psychology here, but even that does not matter in the

        wake of the fact that I am there, that I experience what there

        is to experience. And the experience is only of concern relative

        to what I want to do with myself. <BR>

<BR>

        The bad comes in here because I always wonder at what point what

        is happening (in art) is the thing that moves me. Because partly

        what I want is to be dislodged -- not from experience, but back

        into it. So something can be mundane and have value. I used to

        listen to a lot of free jazz because I didn't understand it,

        and my first attraction was always to that which I did not understand.

        Then as time passed, I realized that there were hierarchies of

        value there, too. So the genre still relied on something that

        held it up against itself. Unless I walked away from it...<BR>

<BR>

        Look, we know that not everything laid out before us is good

        and interesting and fascinating and worth examining. We have

        an unconscious not even for psychology's sake, but just because

        the organism we are MUST filter consciousness to attend to it.

        If everything arose for you at once, you would freeze in the

        midst of this rising, apart from life itself. Husserl calls this

        &quot;compresence&quot; -- the parts of things that exist that

        we do not see, but which we know are a part of what we do see,

        but which we do not need to acknowledge because their existence

        is purpose(ful)ly hidden for/from us. But the bad does not solve

        our problem -- by shutting something out, by rejecting it, or

        by accepting it and embracing it the way as teenagers my friends

        and I love graveyards, we do not solve the problem of its opposite.

        That is why the bad scares us as much as it did the surrealists,

        who discovered it in the unconscious (but they never decoded

        it; they just turned it into language!), and then twisted the

        world around to point back at the horror of the modern, even

        as they only wanted the modern. So when we want the new -- the

        bad being a way into it -- we also may be wanting the destruction

        of the need for the new. But remember, as Bettleheim shows us

        in &quot;The Informed Heart&quot;, children become autistic --

        always repeating the old, though an old whose context appears

        to have vanished (it must be decoded) -- because they know that

        their parents believed that they &quot;should not exist&quot;.

        Can we treat the bad this way, too? Because then it will always

        repeat itself beneath the level of the real on which we operate,

        but then become the level of the real that we refuse -- thus,

        the unconscious -- and thus, the real on which everything else

        depends, the real on which we must always weigh in...<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jono,</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I like what you say here, and

        some of this I've thought about, especially your understanding

        that this is actually a kind of description wherein we access

        the real, through a kind of heightened appreciation of the mundane,

        or the &quot;bad.&quot; But I do think too that I am thinking

        about the greater culture and its ability to be in a kind of

        tacky drive to be real, which is symptomatic of a capitalistic

        system where the bottom line, a tacky concept in many respects,

        is the bottom line. It is this drive for the base common denominator

        that defines us as a culture where capital, and its ever freer

        flow, is what's constantly at stake, whether we are aware of

        it or not, and largely not-- though if we also follow our thoughts,

        &quot;why are we wearing a tie today?&quot; we can tell right

        away why, and what for.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I think that a culture derived

        out of the economic system reflects that system of organization,

        not just in its choice of hierarchies, and such, but in its symptoms,

        and culture maybe the best display of symptomatic response. In

        this sense the bottom line is often expressed, expressed to death

        often times, in a culture of the bad. Where the bad is what you

        are more than likely going to get, a race to the bad, to the

        bottom of the bad. In this sense we devolve. This is what I meant

        by suggesting a turn into the bad maybe what is necessary to

        fully awaken from the dream of the good, which often is seen

        as an attempt to be good, but for reasons of less than pure.

        It seems one could be both pure and bad, where as it is often

        hard to be both pure and good.</FONT></P>

        From Claire Barbetti, Editor of <A HREF="http://www.janushead.org/">Janus

        Head</A></FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It seems to me that this engagement

        with &quot;the bad&quot; is part of the first few steps past

        what Kostelanetz calls an era of &quot;decadence,&quot; characterized

        by a disillusionment, an ennui, a sarcastic-but false- delight

        in the common, the sentimental, the sensational, the tasteless.

        From shopping malls, to Vegas, to &quot;pleather&quot;-the plastic

        and fabricated-it has been very fashionable the past few decades

        to take the entertainment of the everyday ordinary, call it kitsch,

        and elevate it to &quot;high art.&quot; In lieu of working towards

        meaning, towards what is sacred, which is unfashionable by any

        current academic standards, the search for it has been transposed

        upon the object and the value system in which it resides. And

        this &quot;object,&quot; through much contemporary art and theory,

        becomes glorified as the &quot;alpha and omega&quot; of the system;

        take Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans, or Deleuze and Guattari's

        theory of the simulacrum, for instance. It also becomes a fetish,

        similar to Zizek's description of Caffeine-Free Diet Coke (I'm

        ashamed to admit I'm drinking it right now) as <I>objet petit

        a</I>: &quot;the real thing,&quot; complete unto itself, but

        empty of nourishment, incapable of any further transformation

        into something beyond itself.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's chic, <I>tr&egrave;s</I>

        <I>chouette</I>, but I think this smarmy delight in what amounts

        to clever manipulations of the &quot;closed set&quot; of system--

        in effect, settling for literary and artistic status quo-- is

        becoming tiresome. The proliferate self-reflexivity of post modernism,

        the ironic commentary within and on the creative act itself,

        has become a symptom of stagnation. Baudelaire, himself no stranger

        to <I>haute</I> indifference, makes this point also in his &quot;L'H&eacute;autontimoroum&eacute;nos,&quot;

        when his speaker calls &quot;Irony&quot; his &quot;evil twin&quot;

        and laments that he is &quot;Doomed to an endless laugh, but

        never/ Able to wear the simplest smile!&quot;</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Is &quot;the bad&quot; new?

        If it's an attempt to move away from current and standard cultural

        perspectives, to &quot;think outside of the box,&quot; it shares

        the qualities of what has been termed the <I>avant garde</I>.

        And one of the marks of the <I>avant garde</I> is that it introduces

        a new way of seeing things, finding freshness wherever it can

        be found, meaning in the noumenal, the everyday where normally

        it would not be found. It's energetic, restless-and sometimes

        angry- in its attempt to remember what has been forgotten or

        relegated to the barracks of the worthless.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I'm reminded while I'm writing

        this of some of the great Italian films. De Sico, Visconti, even

        some Fellini, have presented images and scenes that many could

        term sentimental, cloying, melodramatic. <I>Umberto D.'s</I>

        elderly man who is ashamed to beg in front of his little dog;

        lines like &quot;when trouble starts, there's no stopping it&quot;

        from <I>La Terra Trema</I>. But such scenes generally aren't

        considered shallow or &quot;in bad taste.&quot; The simple is

        affected with such an earnestness that cultural prescriptions

        of intellectual stylishness disintegrate, and what is left is

        a heart-felt presentation of the human condition. &quot;Self-consciousness&quot;

        dissolves into generosity; the &quot;precious&quot; or &quot;clich&eacute;&quot;

        becomes viable and valuable, not something to poke fun at. Perhaps

        &quot;the bad&quot;-for lack of a better term, though I like

        it nonetheless-is in some sense a venture into humility.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To return to Whitman-- &quot;Song

        of Myself&quot; was hated by the literary establishment when

        it appeared. The Atlantic Monthly printed a review in 1882 which

        cited &quot;frequent feebleness of form and style which reduce

        large portions of the work to tedious and helpless prose&quot;

        and continued: &quot;The absurdities, the crudities, in which

        Whitman indulges are almost unlimited and all but omnipresent.

        ... [W]e cannot see that the ends of freedom in art, or grandeur

        of any kind, are served by adopting as the symbol for a writer

        the term 'literat.' To call him an 'ink-rat' would be much more

        forcible and original.&quot; I always laugh at this nickname

        for Whitman-- well, he *was* an ink-rat, and he made that into

        a good thing. Would that we'd all be Whitmanic ink-rats, sloppy

        desparadoes, instead of the obscure guardian of the ever-receding

        past who wrote the 1882 review.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Whitman *wanted* to be bad.

        He wanted to be wicked, evil, naked, barbaric -- even dead. There

        was nothing really camp about this desire to be bad; I mean,

        it wasn't tame college &quot;badness&quot; like Plan 9 or Attack

        of the Killer Tomatoes. That seems to be &quot;the bad&quot;

        of a contented middle class, a kind of forgettable bad hobby.

        Whitman's was a full-fledged, mature self-despising, a life of

        the bad, coupled with an almost otherworldly sense of joy and

        merging with other people. It was self-renunciation. He overdid

        it.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nothing in American culture

        today seems to me to be as bad as Whitman's bad. Not TV ads;

        they don't take risks at all. Sitcoms? Too refined. Malls? Too

        carefully and intelligently planned out. Interstates come close,

        if you walk on them barefoot. The early 80's Chevrolet and Oldsmobile

        station wagons are worthless hulks, and wonderfully comfortable

        in a very bad, wasteful way, and I bet they're unsafe, but not

        artfully &quot;bad.&quot; I've seen movies that are really bad,

        and for that reason groundbreaking (movies being the supreme

        American form of the day)-- &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; is one,

        and a classic of our cinema. I saw a little movie called &quot;Nitwit

        Predelick&quot; that was terrible. I remember some bad pop music

        that was trying to be &quot;good&quot;--Daniel Johnson springs

        to mind. I also remember bad music that actually was good, like

        Captain Beefheart, Steely Dan, and early Negativland-- bad, bold,

        and nearly perfectly composed.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I agree with Andrew that this

        is the basic movement of punk rock, a kind of forceful badness

        for badness' sake. But then the margin widens, and soon it's

        retro to do punk; that's the safe zone, and you're onto something

        else. But I disagree that &quot;the bad&quot; has anything to

        do with &quot;tackiness&quot; -- or to use a similar adjective,

        &quot;cheesiness.&quot; That's a rec room antler rack, a tudor-style

        coffee table with white circles on it. That's a flea market.

        I think punk music is something else, a real contrary, not a

        violation of manners. It's Chaucer's portrayal of a man unwittingly

        french-kissing a woman's butthole in the dark and thinking it

        strange that she has hair on her &quot;face.&quot; It's the woman

        who allows it! It's Ginsberg's waitresses in &quot;Howl.&quot;

        &quot;The bad&quot; is a freefall, and you're not supposed to

        know where you are or where you'll end up.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I have a J. Geils Band album

        called &quot;You're Gettin Even While I'm Gettin Odd&quot; that

        never made it to compact disc. I bought it on cassette when I

        was in my early teens. It's really a weird bunch of songs, little

        rhymed sermons about hedonistic Pacific coast life and culture,

        that are so abstracted from reality as to be haunting. One imagines

        the furrows of cocaine plowed through by Seth Justman and the

        boys during recording sessions. One also imagines the master

        reel-to-reel in deep storage in the basement of EMI Studios in

        Los Angeles. Anyway, these songs have meant a lot to my poems

        over the years, and I can't even explain why. There's something

        liberating in the concept of superfailure, of the late-career

        follies of someone so obviously talented as Justman, an obscure

        example of American pop music at its worst/best. The failure

        of the work creates a space I can inhabit, because after all--

        I'm a failure too. I bet all poets most acutely feel they've

        failed after they finish their greatest work.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I do not believe, however,

        that anything, a work of art or otherwise, has value in its badness

        per se. Otherwise every Kung Fu movie would be a classic. There

        has to be something recognizably human in any &quot;good&quot;

        work of art; something funny, or sexy, or tragic, that is universal

        to our experience. It may be &quot;bad&quot; in the way it's

        done, or explained, or contained. It's perhaps a partial picture,

        or too much of a frontal image, something offensive in a radical

        way, something that defies a cultural stigma. Something like

        in the movie Magnolia when all the characters--in different locations

        around the city--started singing the same sappy song. Magical

        realism? Not really. That moment was out-of-boundaries in almost

        every sense. It was a bad idea, P.T. Anderson. But the corny

        pop song moment turned out to be touching. Dare I say it? The

        movie, in the end, was moving, and the song's lyrics echoed real

        human experience.</FONT></P>

        BAD MIMESIS<BR>

<BR>

        K. Silem Mohammad, Poet, Madman, Zombie</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I want to address briefly two

        related approaches to badness that I find especially interesting

        in the context of both my own work and wider trends in recent

        practice. Both of these approaches involve a mimetic principle,

        albeit a mimesis that shifts its focus from a concentration on

        the act of composition itself to a broader gesture of cultural

        imitation.<BR>

<BR>

        The first kind of badness involves the appropriation of &quot;amateurish,&quot;

        &quot;sentimental,&quot; or &quot;clunky&quot; methods of versification

        as found on a &quot;folk&quot; level. Models for this approach

        include greeting-card rhymes, high-school love poetry, song lyrics,

        and so on. Of poets who have done extensive work in this vein,

        Charles Bernstein comes to mind. Many of the poems in <I>With

        Strings</I>, for example, with their awkward rhymes, rigid but

        imprecise meter, and stilted expressive quality (&quot;The Boy

        Soprano&quot; is typical) are clear imitations of sub-mainstream

        amateur production. A question that comes to mind upon reading

        such mimetic badness is whether it is intended as parodic of

        the people who write such &quot;unskilled&quot; verse in earnest,

        or whether it is intended to outrage an imagined set of readers

        who are expected to react in frustration or contempt because

        they are used to more &quot;polished,&quot; mainstream work (I

        say &quot;imagined,&quot; because such readers are clearly not

        the primary intended market for such work). Both these possibilities

        involve the suspicion that someone is being ridiculed, and it

        is thus hard to resist the temptation to read such work as satire.

        An added difficulty then lies in determining whether the target

        of this supposed satire is the crudeness of the poetry it mimics

        or the crudeness of the aesthetic that rejects such poetry out

        of hand. This difficulty is easily dispensed with if we assume

        (as I do) that Bernstein has no interest in making fun of amateur

        poets. Nor is it probable that such work is meant simply as an

        indictment, say, of the commerciality of Hallmark-style poetics;

        this may be part of an underlying rhetorical structure, but it

        is unlikely that Bernstein would have as his main objective the

        lampooning of such an easy mark. The context of his larger body

        of work suggests that his real aim is to problematize the values

        of the &quot;Official Verse Culture,&quot; values in which there

        is no room for rough-hewn doggerel.<BR>

<BR>

        And yet, neither is it simply the case that Bernstein is calling

        the &quot;establishment&quot; on its uptight stuffiness, and

        thus championing a more democratic inclusiveness in poetic practice.

        It seems clear that Bernstein himself sees the cheap sentimentality

        and clich&eacute;d sensibility of the work he is imitating as

        precisely that: cheap and clich&eacute;d. It is this quality

        of abjection that makes it effective as an estranging device.

        If we were to stop here, the result would be to cast Bernstein

        in the mold of high modernist shoring fragments against his ruin,

        or against someone's ruin at any rate. It seems clear, however,

        that Bernstein genuinely <I>enjoys</I> working in this form.

        Unlike Eliot, who introduces &quot;debased&quot; cultural fragments

        into his text as if with tweezers at arm's length, Bernstein

        seems perfectly at home in the dumbness of his sources. Or, perhaps

        some would say, like someone who has <I>made</I> himself at home

        in them-implying that appropriation of the bad, like any appropriation,

        is always to some extent an act of colonization, of moving in

        on indigenous territory and converting it into an outpost.<BR>

<BR>

        But the colonization in question is not occurring in a space

        of &quot;pure,&quot; hitherto inviolate tradition, if any tradition

        was ever such. It is a space, in fact, already colonized many

        times over, by the forces of capitalism and/or random devolution

        that have shaped the contemporary intellectual landscape. The

        &quot;crude&quot; verse written by the thousands of people who

        write poetry on a regular basis throughout America is not an

        unmediated outpouring of sincerity, unsullied by the sophisticating

        effects of institutional indoctrination; it is a learned genre.

        Its formal and thematic homogeneity is a clear indication that

        its authors, despite their typical self-claims, are not writing

        &quot;for themselves&quot; or &quot;from the heart,&quot; but

        for their masters and from example. Can one be said to appropriate

        a tradition that is no tradition, but an internalized mass ritual

        of assent to a hegemonic norm?<BR>

<BR>

        This leads to the second category: work that mimics not the self-consciously

        &quot;literary&quot; efforts of the masses, but their larger

        field of discursive production, including technical communications,

        commercial jargon, interpersonal utterances, and so forth. Bruce

        Andrews' work in books like <I>I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut

        Up</I> consists of loosely strung-together expressions many of

        which seem to have been lifted from overheard conversations on

        public transit, or chat-room conversations, etc. The badness

        in this case is not perceived as a failure to formulate a viable

        aesthetic for composition, but as a much more general failure

        to establish effective social relations through language. The

        poetics of disgust (Sianne Ngai's phrase) is in direct articulation

        with this &quot;sampling&quot; methodology, which expresses badness

        both through its conspicuously &quot;inept&quot; structural ordering

        and the abjection of the social phenomena it samples.<BR>

<BR>

        Both these approaches are suspect in that they are capable of

        being reduced to gestures of elitist mockery. What I find ultimately

        useful and energizing in both Bernstein's and Andrews' work is

        that neither poet ever seems to me to valorize his own &quot;enlightened,&quot;

        &quot;conscious&quot; perspective as social critic over the &quot;unenlightened,&quot;

        &quot;unconscious&quot; perspective (or multiple, fractured perspectives)

        that he adopts or reflects in his mimetic borrowing. Their work

        balances the maintenance of a conviction that the culture <I>is

        in fact unhealthy</I> against an exhilaration at the possibilities

        for constructive synthesis that poetry affords, even in such

        degraded conditions.<BR>

<BR>

        So both these bad mimetic modes, I feel, have a legitimate application

        in a poetics of generous social attentiveness and responsiveness.

        In my own work, I have sampled source texts that exemplify extreme

        levels of cultural stultification, expressed in the most inarticulate

        and graceless ways imaginable-and often containing truly alarming

        racist, sexist, or otherwise destructive sentiments-in order

        to solicit a poetic hybridity that takes serious risks in the

        service of representing the state of the language. &quot;Representing&quot;

        in this way requires a strong stomach at times, as it is not

        just a representation of a degenerated discourse, but of degenerated

        ideas, values, and human beings. For this reason, the humor that

        invariably inserts itself as an element in this work is troubling.

        Why should we laugh at the oppressed, the desperate, the ignorant?

        But without this laugh-reflex (which is in many ways close to

        a gag-reflex), we don't get as close to the subjects, I think.

        Being able to laugh at people's idiotic inability to shape their

        thoughts into coherent language is one step toward getting close

        enough to care about them. It's also a way to distance oneself

        from them, of course, to objectify them. But there <I>is</I>

        an intimacy to be found in badness, and that intimacy (with the

        inarticulate, the inarticulable, the inarticulator) is perhaps

        a useful state for a poet to be</FONT></P>
