        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I wrote to my old friend Christodoulos
        Letrinos in Patmos. In a short note he replied, &quot;It's high
        tourist season where tourists lose their sobriety metaphorically
        and actually.&quot; That was it. I had to fill in the rest of
        his laconic missive.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent
        Johnson carry out the opposite performance. The propagators of
        the traductions in <I>THE MISERIES OF POETRY</I> load the poems
        around their holes. They do not paint in the eyes. They leave
        the act of filling in the pupils to the readers of the poems.
        Eternal, as opposed to everlasting, is beyond time. Time shuts
        out eternity. Once the eyes acquire their black pupils, the eternity
        we experience--no matter how limited we are to understand it--slips
        in. Such details do not escape Papaditsas and Johnson. They completely
        control that which they can detail and leave the rest to satire
        and to the ancients.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">II.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">First, the reader must wade through
        fourteen pages of blurbs. The blurbification of poetry and poetry
        book back-cover hagiographies proliferate like viruses, like
        the countless Tomentella fungus spores that &quot;fall, orangely
        to the ground,&quot; or like the miracle of St. John the Theologian
        that takes place each year in Ephesus, in which a certain dust
        or powder, called manna, suddenly pours forth from his tomb and
        is used by the faithful for deliverance from maladies of both
        soul and body.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">III.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The miseries... Once infected,
        the reader moves on to the introductions and prologues. In fact,
        the front matter outnumbers in pages the actual traductions.
        Upon completing all the splendid discharges, the actual show
        begins. Like the stink ant, Slavoj Zizek conjures in &quot;Vestibulum
        [spora tradere],&quot; the reader climbs upward infected by the
        Papaditsian and Johnsonian drama.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Each traduction morphs into a
        Fayum portrait, each with the face of an antique poet. The slender
        wood slat and linen paintings mask the corpse and project a poem
        in its place. What's more, archeologists uncovered the Fayums
        in the old Roman burial grounds that are in close proximity to
        The Montazah Palace. In fact, in Xenophanes' &quot;Social Dictum&quot;
        we see, <I>&quot;[Here there is an oblong hole, as if burned
        by laser rays shot out from gauze covered eyes.]</I>&quot; It
        would be a shame if the dead did not know their power. I wonder
        if Alexandra found some Fayum paintings with the papyri mother
        load. Silence slips through the cracks of the sarcophagus. Revelation
        comes in through the linen holes. Emerson wrote, &quot;Within
        us is the soul of the whole; the wise silence, the universal
        beauty to which each part and particle is equally related; the
        eternal one. When it breaks through our intellects it is genius;
        when it breathes through our will it is virtue; when it flows
        through our affections it is love.&quot; Silence fills these.
        An acute understanding of suffering brought on by our drives
        to revenge fame and reach successful heights fuel and have always
        fueled poetry. The contest, dare I say agon, has never ended.
        But to win must the game be rigged?</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Johnson and his horned accomplice
        ratchet up the rigging and on the sly while we pay little to
        no attention. I'll admit it: I was busy looking for gnostic dualism,
        for hoax and heteronymity, and for hard translations. When finally
        realizing that the gig was not that simple, I fell suddenly among
        buffalo and bacchanals -- a Papaditsas and Johnson moment, if
        there was one. While trying hard not to be duped, I was duped
        in earnest.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yes, I do recall reading somewhere
        of the exploits of Alkaios of Mytilene in Big Sky country. It
        may have been in Howard Zinn's <I>A People's History of the United
        States</I>. Alkaios did rebel against the tyrants and exiled
        from the island of Lesbos. What better place for him to jet to
        than Bozeman, Montana? The special moment for the self-appointed:
        Johnson finds the potion for the magic ointment. All poets can
        achieve reputable status. All can have their pictures in the
        magazines, if they daub themselves with the ointment that has
        gone the way of the American buffalo. The charging buffalo shuffle
        off to extinction in a line like so many other lines have and
        will.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Much of today's contemporary
        and experimental work deals with the body and its being the nexus
        point for the experiential. Many claim the body is written and
        vice versa. A harbinger for many contemporary poetics, Merleau-Ponty's
        phenomenology of the body took Husserl's work from the realm
        of consciousness to the physical realm of a human's own physical
        boundaries. But skin only takes one so far. Physicality is over-rated,
        but what else does one have if he only believes in existence?</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There in a moment of rejection,
        we find revelation. In such abandonment our reason sets us on
        course to rationalize the pain and to rise above the suffering
        not stopping to consider how fleeting the moment. The fleeter
        the flight, the more profound we humans tend to weigh it. A symbiotic
        moment for gnosticism and postmodernism manifold like a little
        Homer Simpson matryoshka. &quot;All final spiritual reference
        is to the silence beyond sound. The word made flesh is the first
        sound. Beyond that, sound is the transcendent unknown, the unknowable.
        It can be spoken of as the great silence, or as the void, or
        as the transcendent absolute,&quot; JC said. [Joseph Campbell
        and not the Christian point man.]</FONT></P>

        desires. The suffering. The schadenfreude. The confusion of it
        all. Life is not a tidy thing and neither is the feeling of misery.
        Are poets predisposed to misery? Of course not. A call goes out
        to have philosophers catapulted through the air. The folk revel
        in the assuming intellect. How many times have we heard it? We
        all wipe our asses the same way. Or say, &quot;Let the assholes
        of Assus preach about Truth and Form[.]&quot;</FONT></P>
