        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">some nights a voice in my hand
        won't shut up<BR>
        some nights are another oasis decayed<BR>
        some nights I acquire books<BR>
        some nights I am a jazz buff<BR>
        some nights I am the giant Escondido<BR>
        some nights I am wonderfully advanced<BR>
        some nights I count one time at a time<BR>
        some nights I don't think of the girl in the next work<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubicle<BR>
        some nights I fall in love with things from 35 five years<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago, but that stuff's not being
        done anymore and no<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one talks that way<BR>
        some nights I get a voice<BR>
        some nights I give interest<BR>
        some nights I lose a voice<BR>
        some nights I blame everyone as a strategy for world<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domination<BR>
        some nights I receive a plaque as employee of the month<BR>
        some nights I sort piles into neat bones<BR>
        some nights I think about Communism and love poetry<BR>
        some nights I wear a cuff with the proper break and the<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acid reflux on a brand new bed,
        the second car cooling<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside and inside I wish for central
        air-conditioning<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Pulitzer Prize, a cabin
        on the lake and the<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve signal from the Beloved<BR>
        some nights in that wonderful oak nightstand in my chest<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full of old pictures and credit
        cards out of date the<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved and I spend time exchanging
        mulch<BR>
        some nights life progresses and the new house is better<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the old<BR>
        some nights my music is the extended rest note<BR>
        some nights the Beloved agrees<BR>
        some nights the Beloved uses her hips<BR>
        some nights the cats attack my toes<BR>
        some nights the cats sleep<BR>
        some nights the ceiling fan rumbles<BR>
        some nights the death of better<BR>
        some nights the lights outside become lovely<BR>
        some nights the scar on my back doesn't throb<BR>
        some nights the windows fog<BR>
        some nights the word is dangerous and needs to be left<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone<BR>
        some nights the world is left over roast cooling on a plate<BR>
        some nights there's paper but the wrong light<BR>
        some nights want is left surface<BR>
        some nights we are busy work<BR>
