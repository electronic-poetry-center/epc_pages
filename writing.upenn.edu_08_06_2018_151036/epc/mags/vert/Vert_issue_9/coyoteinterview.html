         FACE="Verdana">ith its first issue, published in October of
        2002, and now its sixth, which has recently shipped, Coyote has
        established itself as one of Brazil's more vital and interesting
        new journals. Edited by Ademir Assun&ccedil;&atilde;o, Rodrigo
        Garcia Lopes and Marcos Losnak, poets all, the magazine's commitment
        to publishing unpublished writers is a part of their larger work
        in opening new spaces for cultural activity in Brazil. Recent
        issues have featured remarkable translations of writing by Adonis,
        Jacques Roubaud, Rosemarie Waldrop, Samuel Beckett and Mina Loy
        (the latter three translated by Rodrigo Garcia Lopes). Coyote
        also publishes art and photography. The consistent quality of
        the work presented in the magazine, as well as the restlessly
        creative graphic design by Losnak and Joca Reiners Terron, continue
        to both enchant and impress. To sample Coyote here in VeRT magazine
        is both an honor and a treat... <B>--</B></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#990000"

        in relation to them? In post-modern times, is it still possible

        dead? Where do you find it in America or elsewhere? Relatedly,

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> Well, all those questions make for
        a big body of water with a lot of possible tributaries. My answer
        will have to be pretty impressionistic and put a lot of talented
        and decent poets into the steamer trunk of historiographical
        abstraction. But I guess literary history feeds on the agonistic
        clash of such abstractions, actually, so for what it's worth,
        here's my little antithesis. I doubt it will improve my current
        standing in certain circles.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To first answer one of the
        questions in the list above: Yes, the Language phenomenon has
        been extremely important to American poetry. Many of the original
        documents created around this movement stand as very impressive
        achievements. And it has had, to varying degrees, international
        repercussions. Along with the Beats, perhaps no other American
        poetic formation has more aggressively affected the landscape
        of literature since the Second World War. But (with a smattering
        of exceptions, like a number of the digital-based and Oulipean-inspired
        poets associated with the Ubuweb group, or certain isolated poets
        pursuing a quasi-Noigandres aesthetic, or the beginnings of what
        one could call a &quot;Dada-Pop&quot; poetics among some younger
        blog writers) the bulk of what is called &quot;innovative&quot;
        or &quot;experimental&quot; in North American poetry today is
        pretty much a generic recycling of attitudes and compositional
        approaches that had their significant moment in the late 70's
        to mid-80's, when it wasn't yet embarrassing to use the term
        &quot;poststructuralism,&quot; and when Language poetry could
        still claim an oppositional status inside U.S. literary culture.
        It really no longer can.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of course, the veteran core
        of Language and its second-generation offshoots (many of whom,
        it should be said, are quite brilliant, even as they are burdened
        by an inertial love-hate animus toward their forebears) still
        want to be seen, and to see themselves, as outside &quot;mainstream,&quot;
        &quot;official verse&quot; poetry, a fuzzy enemy-realm that never
        really gets defined except in the most figurative lit-critical
        terms, i.e., poetry based on the nostalgic or epiphanic experience
        of a &quot;self&quot; that naively assumes to stand beyond the
        language games within which it is staged. Or something to that
        effect. (Most recently the term &quot;School of Quietude&quot;
        has been proposed by one of the leading Language poets as a catchall
        trope for this degenerate poetic force, against which the avant-garde
        must supposedly continue to do brave battle.) This kind of &quot;official&quot;
        poetry, it is repeatedly claimed, is the dominant mode of the
        &quot;academy&quot; and of the most influential magazines, like,
        for example, <I>American Poetry Review, The New Yorker,</I> or
        <I>Poetry</I>.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, it's true that strains
        of softly surrealist, anecdotal, personal experience poetry have
        been ubiquitous since the 1960's, and during the 70's and most
        of the 80's these were, indeed, the reigning styles. But for
        the past decade or so its projection as the hegemonic poetic
        discourse has been a polemic of convenience for the &quot;avant-garde,&quot;
        one whose effect (and, arguably, <I>intent</I>) is much less
        to describe the actual case than to obscure the fact of a terribly
        ironic, rapidly developing interface. Increasingly, that is,
        Language poetry and &quot;avant-garde&quot; styles growing directly
        out of it (under myriad denominations, like &quot;post-language,&quot;
        &quot;abstract lyric,&quot; &quot;ellipticism,&quot; &quot;new
        synthesis,&quot; &quot;third generation New York school,&quot;
        and so on) have come to be the zeitgeist at virtually all the
        elite and many of the second-tier creative writing programs-few
        serious younger poets with any degree of reading have an interest
        in writing the scenic, first-person lyric of narrative experience.
        What's happened is that most younger poets now want to write
        the <I>fractured lyric of intellectual, self-reflexive experience</I>,
        or else some theory-inflected version of the cool, campy Frank
        O'Hara-like poem, or some hybrid version of these styles. This
        &quot;experimental&quot; atmosphere constitutes the ascendant
        period style --the poems of our climate, as one of our famous
        poets once put it-- and very few literary journals or presses
        of consequence today are truly hostile toward this fashionable
        &quot;innovative&quot; work.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In short, the aesthetic of
        non-narrative pushed by Language has become rapidly absorbed
        and adapted (as the hip insouciant poetics of the New York School
        had before it) into institutional poetic arenas, and the public
        demeanor of its prominent Authors, older and younger alike, is
        increasingly circumscribed by all the institutional boundaries
        of &quot;official verse culture&quot;: prizes, grants, competitions,
        academic careers, university or slick corporate/government-funded
        publishing venues, etc. While the speed with which this absorption
        has occurred (with increasing momentum since roughly the end
        of the first Gulf War) is surprising, it was fated to happen:
        For Language poetry, which proclaimed in its manifestoes a militant
        opposition to the poetic &quot;I&quot; or &quot;Self,&quot; never
        undertook to question, <I>in practice</I>, the ideological assumptions
        and entrapments of authorial orthodoxy. Or rather, the Language
        poets never managed to follow through on the implications of
        their theoretical principles (the New York School never had any,
        save a certain hyper self-conscious commitment to personality
        worship and name-dropping) and turn the category of Authorship
        into a <I>poetic problem</I> to be explored, with the aim of
        making strange (<I>ostranie</I>, the Russians called it) its
        comfortable and automatized surrounds. Their poetry has never
        really imagined itself beyond the page and is now entropically
        caught in a two-dimensional performative realm, the range of
        its innovations limited to surface issues of prosody, visual
        arrangement, syntax, and so forth. The movement is, essentially,
        a formalist phenomenon, informed (in the case of a number of
        the first-generation Language writers) by increasingly stale
        and poignant pronouncements about the political relevance of
        &quot;experimental&quot; practice.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: </FONT></I></B><I><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So Language poetry along with its progeny
        is an example of avant-garde history repeating itself?</FONT></I></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">KJ:</FONT></I></B><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> Yes, I think that's becoming clear.
        The current American experimental wing is to mainstream, traditional
        poetry what Cubism quickly became to traditional painting: something
        that looks different on the canvass, something often quite exciting,
        but readily lending itself to ornate framing and hanging in the
        Museum. There is nothing <I>wrong</I> with this, of course, and
        we will always have, and should have, institutionalized art that
        abides by the genetic modes of reproduction the culture requires--traditional
        and &quot;avant-garde&quot; alike. This will always constitute,
        it goes without saying, the <I>bulk</I> of artistic production.
        And some of it will be excellent art. But my point is that American
        experimentalist poetry is caught inside an outmoded grid of cultural
        rules; it is still waiting for its collectively articulated,
        decisive conceptualist moment. When that moment comes, things
        will get quite a bit more subversively indeterminate and exciting
        than they now are.</FONT></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As a poet, do you see yourself as free

         FACE="Verdana">No, not at all. I'm certainly as capable of hypocrisy
        as anyone. But the critique is an important one to make, I think.</FONT></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: </FONT></I></B><I><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the world, as well as in the U.S.,
        there is a tradition of poets who were formally innovative as
        well as libertarians in the existential level. One can think
        of Whitman, Rimbaud, Thoreau, Blake, Maiakovski, Lorca, Allen
        Ginsberg, George Oppen etc... Is this tradition still alive?
        Or are contemporary poets, as you seem to suggest, more inclined
        to risk only at the formal level?</FONT></I></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">KJ:</FONT></I><FONT
         COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
         FACE="Verdana">It's an interesting question. I'm not sure I
        would see the list of poets you present as representative of
        a tradition, actually, insofar as their &quot;libertarianisms&quot;
        are of quite different natures. But it's true, certainly, that
        all these poets had intense ideological engagements beyond their
        aesthetic practices-and in some, of course, there is a conflation
        between the engagement and the practice.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Your mention of Oppen is especially
        interesting, inasmuch as he stopped writing for many years after
        his early and most experimental book, <I>Discrete Series</I>,
        so as to put his &quot;existential&quot; ideals into fullest
        practice. He was a member of the Communist Party, as you may
        know, unaware of Stalin's crimes when he was, apparently, and
        for him there had to be a total commitment one way or the other:
        If you were going to work to change society, then that is what
        you did, without distraction; if you were going to write poetry,
        then that is what you did, without distraction. The Objectivist
        notion of &quot;sincerity,&quot; for Oppen, is far from merely
        textual.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, it's fascinating that
        Oppen is taken by many of the Language poets and their &quot;heirs,&quot;
        as you put it, as a poetic hero of sorts. While there have been
        some qualifications and dissensions over the past few years,
        it's still generally the case that for the Language tendency,
        formal experiment is deemed to have a sense of seditious political
        value: &quot;the disruption of linguistic habit to foreground
        the social and ideological constructedness of language,&quot;
        etc. is held to be the most advanced and meaningful act of poetic
        resistance. This view of poetry's &quot;radical&quot; mission
        is assumed by hundreds of poets, even as their poetry and criticism
        is more and more positioned within, and directed at, academic
        venues of little civic consequence.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Oppen would have laughed, no
        doubt, at such (what he might have called in his cadre years)
        petit-bourgeois hubris. It's clear, if you've read his letters
        and interviews, that his absolute commitment to poetry was a
        personal, ethical act, through and through, bereft of any presumption
        of subversive political value.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So this is a problematic issue,
        in my opinion, this raising of the sails of ethical value on
        the gunboat of aesthetic experiment. It's not that this poetry
        doesn't have a key role to play, for it does: it is an advanced
        undertaking, doing the work in poetry, you might say, that little-known
        radio astronomers on a cold mountaintop in the Andes are doing
        in the realm of cosmology. The problem is that these poet radio
        astronomers claim their relatively abstruse work deserves to
        be popularly recognized and widely read, and that the science
        journalists writing the big-selling popular astronomy books should
        be given the boot for simplifying reality. And that is simply
        misguided. It's a mistaking of a specialized part for the multi-dimensioned
        whole.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In past months, in fact, as
        the imperialist assault in Iraq was about to get underway, and
        as masses of people were seeking, in ways unseen since Vietnam,
        to form united fronts against the invasion, the practical implications
        of this quasi-Adornean, holier-than-thou stance became grossly
        apparent. During that time, Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman,
        and Barrett Watten, the three most prominent theoreticians of
        the Language movement --and deservedly so, each of them is brilliantly
        provocative-- published pieces that clearly dismissed (in Bernstein
        and Watten's cases indirectly; in Silliman's case bluntly) the
        <I>Poets Against the War</I> website, a project initiated by
        the prominent &quot;mainstream&quot; poet Sam Hamill, to which,
        rather astoundingly, over 15,000 poets contributed. As one would
        expect, most of these poems were, indeed, written in the referential,
        polemical, personal, and urgent address of traditional political
        poetry. It could not have been, nor should it have been, otherwise.
        The project received unprecedented media coverage, hundreds of
        anti-war readings were held around the country (some attracting
        audiences in the thousands), and a book selection from the website
        became the fastest-selling U.S. poetry anthology in the past
        four decades.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">What did the Language poets
        have to say about this? Essentially, Bernstein, Silliman, and
        Watten suggested that the <I>Poets Against the War</I> project
        was politically and culturally retrograde, that, as Bernstein
        put it, the time did not call for &quot;righteous monologue&quot;
        and &quot;digestible messages,&quot;<I> </I>but for a poetic
        discourse of &quot;complexity and ambiguity.&quot; Well, one
        could go on. But it was all quite incredible. I responded to
        this stance in a widely disseminated article (currently available
        at VeRT, issue #8 http://www.litvert.com/ ), wherein I more or
        less proposed that the elitist position adopted by Bernstein
        and his fellows was clear evidence of the shipwreck of Language
        poetry's vanguardist project.</FONT></P>

         FACE="Verdana">Let's change focus now: Yasusada&acute;s book,
        Double Flowering, was accused of being &quot;a criminal act&quot;.
        While in 2002 millions of people learned of Yasusada after one
        of our largest newspapers carried a multi-page feature on him
        in its literary supplement, the general Brazilian reader of poetry
        is not yet familiar with the specific background polemics. Could
        you explain the episode? How is Yasusadas&acute;s reception today,
        after &quot;the crime&quot;?</FONT></I></P>

         FACE="Verdana">The phrase &quot;criminal act,&quot; was used
        by the editor of <I>The American Poetry Review</I>, the largest
        and most influential publication of poetry in the United States.
        The magazine had featured a big &quot;Special Supplement&quot;
        of Yasusada's work, along with an introductory essay. After the
        work's fictional nature was revealed, this editor became very
        upset and made the remark to a journalist writing a story on
        the matter. Of course, if Yasusada was a &quot;criminal act,&quot;
        then so was most of the poetry written by Pessoa, most of the
        major philosophy written by Kierkegaard, and quite possibly,
        it seems, all of the work written under the name of &quot;Shakespeare.&quot;
        Not a bad crime family to be in!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There have been many pieces
        published on the controversy, and more are in preparation. A
        volume is also being prepared by the poet Anthony Robinson, which
        will gather much of this work along with new essays. One of the
        most interesting contributions was published in <I>The Nation</I>,
        a prominent U.S. magazine. The beginning of this piece nicely
        lays out the first outlines of the &quot;scandal&quot;; so, in
        answer to your question, for the sake of convenience, clarity,
        and interest, I'll quote the opening of that:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Doubled Flowering: From the Notebooks
          of Araki Yasusada is the most controversial poetry book since
          Allen Ginsberg's Howl. Lingua Franca devoted a special section
          to it. The Boston Review hosted a forum of responses to it. The
          American Poetry Review featured an insert of Yasusada's poems
          preceded by a portrait of the writer. On August 9, 1997, Asahi
          Shinbun, Japan's leading newspaper, published a front-page story
          on Yasusada. Poems and letters from the book have appeared in
          major literary journals in the United States, England, Australia,
          Russia, Spain, Israel and Italy. <BR>
          And yet Araki Yasusada - the diarist from Hiroshima, the Zennist,
          the member of a prominent literary group called Layered Clouds,
          the Jack Spicer afficionado conversant in French and English,
          the family man whose family was devastated by the nuclear blast,
          the writer whose moving poems, letters and notes comprise the
          text of Doubled Flowering, this Araki Yasusada - apparently never
          existed. The translator and critic Eliot Weinberger suggested
          as much in the Village Voice, writing on &quot;witness poetry,&quot;
          which he decries as &quot;a set of biographical criteria that
          favors verifiable experience over imagination.&quot; Lingua Franca
          and others followed suit in publishing articles about the hoax.
          Wesleyan University Press, which had been interested in printing
          the Yasusada volume, dropped the idea.<BR>
          No one has yet claimed to have written the book, despite suspicions
          that the Yasusada materials were generated by Kent Johnson -
          a professor at Highland Community College in Freeport, Illinois,
          and the self-proclaimed literary executor of Yasusada's main
          &quot;translator&quot; (whose reality is also dubious). Critic
          Marjorie Perloff charged in the Boston Review that Johnson is
          the author, although he denies it. The time for a hoaxster's
          revelation would seem to have come and gone; but Yasusada's work
          is more than a mere hoax, even if his biography is.<BR>
          Most of the individual poems were published in respected journals
          (including Grand Street and Conjunctions), their fictional authorship
          undiscovered, as the work of Hiroshima survivor Araki Yasusada.
          Along with Yasusada's own purported writings, there are numerous
          footnotes, scholarly commentaries and references that weave,
          in the manner of Woody Allen's Zelig, documentary facts into
          Yasusada's putative biography (for instance, references to actual
          Japanese poets, literary groups and affairs in Hiroshima). While
          there seem to be enough anachronisms (a reference to scuba-diving
          gear, for example, in a poem dated before the invention of such)
          and outright mistakes (a Japanese woman given a name that would
          only be used by a man) to suggest that something is awry, the
          general impression given is one of scholarly thoroughness and
          detail. As a result, many editors published Yasusada believing
          that he was, indeed, a Japanese poet and nuclear bomb survivor.
          Many of them have been quite angry to learn that they were taken
          in by an elaborate fiction. Some have suggested that no one who
          has not experienced an event as cataclysmic as the bombing of
          Hiroshima has the right to &quot;pretend&quot; to have done so,
          that such a pretense demeans the people who truly suffered there.<BR>
          But before we launch into that furiously raging debate, let's
          consider the work itself, which, until questions concerning its
          authorship waxed full, provoked only wide-ranging international
          praise</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, this was published a few
        years ago, and quite a bit more has happened since and is still
        continuing, though now the controversy has pretty much moved
        from the journalistic realm into the academic one.</FONT></P>

         COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Months before, however,
        it was praised by many critics as one of the most astonishing
        books to have appeared in the literary scene. Marjorie Perloff
        wrote that the relevant issue is editorial hypocrisy: &quot;If
        they thought it was such good writing, they should still think
        it was good writing.&quot;</FONT></I></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well,
        yes. But it's &quot;good writing&quot; inside a conceptual apparatus
        that moves beyond the expected protocols of attribution and circulation--it's
        a work that somewhat brazenly lays down a challenge to literary
        authority, in the doubled sense of that word. And so it is difficult,
        perhaps, for most to judge it dispassionately, in the sense of
        traditional axiological parameters. In fact, as I have often
        said, there is a sense in which the ambiguous authorial status
        of the Yasusada writing is <I>embedded into, and inseparable
        from, the work's very</I> <I>aesthetics</I>, so if someone is
        very upset by its apocryphal nature, it is unlikely he or she
        will consider it on the merits of its textual record.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As I suggested in my first
        answer, the problem is that the current reading culture at large
        --even that segment of it regarded as most critically sophisticate--
        is generally not yet prepared to approach poetry with the open-minded
        notion that a body of work may hide more regarding its creative
        origins than it appears to hold on its &quot;legal&quot; attributional
        surface. Currently, unfortunately, North American poetry, traditional
        and innovative alike, is very much locked into an antique ideological
        function of authorship handed down from 17th and 18th century
        English law, and we expect our Authors to be empirically verifiable,
        well-wrapped in the cocoons of their copyrightable identities.
        History shows that it didn't always used to be that way, but
        our poets act as if it were a natural and immutable condition.</FONT></P>

         FACE="Verdana">How do you see the polemics retrospectively and
        what lessons or insights did you take from the episode? What
        contributions it left to the contemporary literary debate? Could
        you mention bizarre or funny responses and reactions to the book?</FONT></I></P>
        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">KJ:</FONT></I></B><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> I think the polemics have for the
        most part been very healthy, and I believe they have opened up
        for consideration a whole potential area of poetic production
        that had been largely non-existent. Time will tell. If in the
        future we have the development of a fairly broad counter-sphere
        of heteronymous practices that begin to freely circulate alongside
        the habitual province of &quot;empirical&quot; and genetic ascription
        --a kind of parallel poetic economy, if you will, one not beholden
        to the relations of production and exchange of the official literary
        culture-- then I think Motokiyu's work will be seen as having
        made an important contribution. Should readers and editors come
        to take such ascriptional democracy for granted, I think it would
        be a salutary development, one that would greatly expand imaginative
        freedom and make reading and writing more interesting in a variety
        of unpredictable ways, and more resistant, by far, to being tamed.
        Of course, in that event, Pessoa will always be the main hero
        of the new field Therein, poetry will derive its mystery and
        force not so much from what it is &quot;on the page,&quot; as
        from what it is <I>in the world.</I></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As to bizarre or funny stories,
        let's see... I suppose some of the outraged reaction from certain
        circles, where the outrage came from those who otherwise hold
        to earnest theoretical claims about the over-reifications of
        self and identity in poetry, seemed funny and bizarre to me from
        time to time. I was also called a &quot;racist&quot; by some,
        and that was certainly bizarre, since <I>Doubled Flowering</I>
        is a decidedly anti-racist work.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And there were some curious
        incidents that had their element of poignancy. One of the most
        telling, for me, was that Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris
        had planned to include a substantial entry on Yasusada in their
        great, two-volume anthology project, <I>Poems for the Millenium</I>,
        perhaps the most important gathering of international innovative
        poetries in any language, ever. Yet, when they discovered at
        the last minute that Yasusada was a more complex authorial entity
        than they had imagined, they excised his poems. As I reported
        Motokiyu writing in a letter to Rothenberg after he found this
        out: &quot;I am wondering, presently, if the writing in your
        book only counts as innovative or exploratory if it comes accompanied
        with a certificate of authenticity.&quot; That's a good question,
        I think.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I don't know how well known
        Rothenberg's work is in Brazil, but he is (despite his terrible
        mistake on Yasusada!) one of the great figures of post-war English
        language poetry, and his elevation of the anthology to the realm
        of art and deep critique has had a profound impact on the course
        of things. He would certainly make for an important feature in
        a future Coyote, if you don't mind me suggesting.</FONT></P>

        after September 11th and the war on Iraq? What can poetry do

        discourse?</FONT></I></P>

         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> I have my outward positions, of course,
        and like most people, I like to sound like I know what I'm talking
        about. But like most people, too, I'm very uncertain about what
        the world is or where it may be headed. And it seems to me that
        poetry must resist the temptation to assume a defining &quot;mission&quot;
        or &quot;role&quot; in these times when we are all hungering
        for firmer bearings. Perhaps what we need to do, as poets, is
        plug our deepest recesses into that great and encompassing uncertainty,
        fear, paradox, and, yes, dark comedy of the current conjuncture
        and just see what happens. Allow our selves to be shocked and
        lit up by the horror. To be transformers, as it were. Needless
        to say, there are as many cords and plugs as there are snakes
        in Medusa's head; and there are as many open outlets as there
        are orifices in Hades. So while we must be bold, we need also,
        I suppose, to be careful and have the polished shield handy!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So I guess I'm saying I'm not
        sure that poetry can or should aspire to &quot;do&quot; anything,
        really. To the extent that poetry does do work beyond its general
        aesthetic circumference, it seems to do so most meaningfully
        when it remains steadfastly what it most &quot;politically&quot;
        is: an autonomous zone of spirit and conscience, a zone that
        should be understood by those who enter it as multifarious and
        many-guised, beholden to no ideology of politics or art. Oppen
        and Zukofsky were onto something not yet sufficiently explored
        when they talked about <I>sincerity</I> as the ground of the
        art. Too easy to dismiss the concept as a sentimental clich&eacute;;
        harder to view and follow one of its countless paths waiting
        there.</FONT></P>

        Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,<BR>
        A way of happening, a mouth.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps in moments of crisis
        like we are now in, powerful poetry may reveal the connections
        of the &quot;political&quot; to that mysterious &quot;mouth&quot;
        Auden evokes. Maybe one could say that the poet's &quot;political&quot;
        task is to show how the &quot;Real&quot; is never separate from
        that dark space. But, well, I guess you can see that I am struggling
        with this answer!</FONT></P>

        <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">KJ:</FONT></I></B><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> I had mentioned some younger poets
        working with a kind of Dada-Pop aesthetic, what they call <I>Flarf</I>-I
        think there are some interesting possibilities there, if they
        can become unstuck from their somewhat unimaginative relationship
        to the flattening figure of Authorship. And I'd mentioned the
        Ubuweb poets, a loose affiliation of visual and web-based writers,
        where there is considerable energy, in particular in Canada.
        I'm fortunate to work very closely with one of the most gifted
        poets of my generation, Forrest Gander. He and I have been co-translating
        the great Bolivian poet Jaime Saenz, and we are now into the
        second book, Saenz's frightening and magnificent book-length
        poem, <I>The Night</I>. Gander, I don't mind saying, is most
        definitely <I>il miglior fabbro</I> in our writing relationship.
        And he will most emphatically be the <I>only</I> contemporary
        poet I will individually name, since if I continue, I will inevitably
        end up, I'm sure, leaving the most obvious people out, including
        some of my friends, and I have few enough friends as it is! So
        I hope you'll understand.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But I will mention three writers
        who are not primarily known as poets, and whose work, I feel,
        is as crucial and singular <I>to poetry</I> as that of anyone
        writing in English today: Eliot Weinberger, generally known as
        translator, essayist, and editor, the finest prose stylist we
        have among those who write <I>about</I> our art, and someone
        who has taken the &quot;essay&quot; into new conceptual realms,
        so that one gets the sense of a wholly new genre in the making;
        David Rosenberg, primarily known as a scholar and translator
        of biblical and Judaic literature, one of the most original thinkers
        about translation's purposes, and who has engaged translation's
        mysteries and paradoxes to create works of poetic fiction that
        look like scholarly books but are something much more otherwordly;
        and Mikhail Epstein, the great Russian cultural theorist, now
        of the U.S., whose works of philosophy, like Wittgenstein's famous
        rabbit figure which changes into a duck and back again, oscillate
        between rigorous theory and delightful poetic fiction.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Frankly, I think we &quot;new
        poets&quot; of the English language have considerably more to
        gain from reading writers like these than we might by reading
        any of our more generic &quot;Poet&quot; contemporaries.</FONT></P>
