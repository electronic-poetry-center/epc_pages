      omoma, yellow sow</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">a mare in evolution is tempted
      to distinction<BR>
      like the friction of degrees or an orange rhombus slab shaped</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">to abstraction and chaffed red
      along the edges<BR>
      until what shows is aged rawhide on display</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">like a crinkled sign in a storefront:<BR>
      <I>&quot;now whose body is really their own?&quot;</I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">and whose body is a painted
      muscle hanging from <BR>
      the meat hook while the artist as taxidermist</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">discovers the cell as outcast
      or breathing as an <BR>
      arrival? Stroke it to find linkage</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">and who will arrive is a shifty
      bum learned in how<BR>
      to yoke curves into bleeding pendulums</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">like quartered wildlife mounted
      as sellable parts<BR>
      not beautified even by her beholder.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">now arrive at enchantment through
      reminiscence,<BR>
      and this time what is cast but a woman in blue silhouette</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">not a man contemplating his
      own reflection, <BR>
      not a snakeskin missing its innards,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">not a tree in repose, afraid
      of his twin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the
      wood flooring) <BR>
      but that same curved figure standing</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">with crooked hips begging<BR>
      seven saints to offer what they haven't got:<BR>
<BR>
      Feather eye to feather be, a child's game, <BR>
      the haunting laugh clap of looping reels</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">but who told Immediacy to be
      the unknown lover of the Traditionalist?<BR>
      who found him breasted: ink blot to ink blot</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">a collage of tonal sequence:
      (he said, <I>no paradises</I>)<BR>
      Flightkeeper take stock, which miles did you record</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">when Spontaneity unrequited
      the Permanist? <BR>
      It's true, I only wanted to be touched</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">but the yellow sow is a slippery
      lover! who gave wing to <BR>
      an unreachable Invisiblist who laid down with Hedona</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">every time Panic loved him too
      well<BR>
      </FONT></P>
