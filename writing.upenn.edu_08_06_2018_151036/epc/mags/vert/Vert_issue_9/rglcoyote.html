        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Dear Andrew Felsinger, </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">[...]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It is a great adventure of cultural
        and poetic resistance to edit this<BR>
        magazine. We have 5 issues so far, 2,000 copies each, that are<BR>
        distributed all over Brazil by Iluminuras, from S&atilde;o Paulo.
        We also send<BR>
        copies to around 700 people in Brazil and abroad. This is our
        first<BR>
        anniversary. We have been published people from many different<BR>
        cultures. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In Coyote # 4, I did a dossieur
        with Rosmarie Waldrop. A friend in NYC<BR>
        is interviewing Cecilia Vicu&ntilde;a. Jaques Roubaud appeared
        in the last<BR>
        issue, Jab&eacute;s is on the way and Adonis is next. We are
        also recovering<BR>
        important texts: I've translated Beckett&acute;s &quot;What is
        the Word&quot;, as well<BR>
        as Mina Loy. We are also involved in an important dialogue with
        Latin<BR>
        American writers, many of them also unknown in Brazil. Of course,
        the<BR>
        magazine is not only a forum for ideas, but also reveals new
        poets and<BR>
        artists. We also publish photographers, visual artists, essayists
        etc.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The situation has gotten a little
        better for poetry in Brazil, since<BR>
        there are now at least 14 magazines dedicated to new poets,<BR>
        contemporary culture, etc. In the 90s, there were three or four.
        The<BR>
        internet has helped a lot.</FONT></P>
