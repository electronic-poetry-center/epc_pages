      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Flippant paddlefish, mechanical
      keelboat, ambient roe</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Who alluded to the explicit niche,
      inasmuch as articulating throbs flail the plucky palpitations,
      the syncretic tinkering of the predictable muscle mass fused
      in the vortex of unimagined fluid, drenched in the split niche,
      y'all.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is difficult to impugn a dilapidated
      taboo, and it is precisely the flickering demolition of this
      alterity that my I is nothing but a crassly shuddered insinuation.
      Be that as it may, there is something incredibly sensual about
      the artificially inverted revulsion of nipple torture.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After I no longer am an I, after
      I no longer am I, after I no longer am, after my I no longer
      is, after my I no longer is an I, will I be, will I be an I,
      will I be at all, will I be an it, will my I be an it, will my
      I still be an I, will my I still be, will I still be, will I
      still be an I, will I still be my I, will my I still be mine,
      will my I finally be still.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The clenched language is shaded
      in the rinsed waste. The stupefying pinprick is resplendent.
      The spines of breathing are in the mist of corruption. The indelible
      light pricks the hypnotic shade where the dismembered stupor
      is worn away, lightly filtering my psalm thru your teeth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Light velvet is punctured in
      the midst of night. The night is not a fringed fraction of breathing
      thorns, fierier shades of agitation decomposing flashy spurts
      of ordure too austere to be undeterrable, but two inches are
      a little too inadequate to enter into a startling arousal, so
      the shaded language is rinsed in the clenched waste.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Will I, who feel I am, who feel
      my I, who feel I am an I, will I finally feel my I as it is,
      or will I finally feel my I as it was, as I am, as if I am, as
      if I am an I, as if I am an it, as if I was when I was, as if
      I were, as if I never was.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I impugn nothing but yr toothy
      insinuations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Light stings light. Lightly strung
      lights, streaming strings of light scheming decomposing stings,
      the limbs of sleep stupefying detached rays, light stinging the
      breath of platinum pleats analogously punctured.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Am I who my I feels I am, if
      I exist, if my I exists, if it is in existence, if it ever existed,
      if it will ever exist. Dismembered light stings velvet stupors,
      indelibly hypnotic light stings the shadows of headstones. What
      is platinum in the fire is all alone, the vaporized voice in
      the flames.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Light stings the austerity of
      blood stinging light that placates the placenta of discursive
      turbulence. What is devoid devours what is stiff. In the precise
      maelstrom of smoldering argumentation, what is indicated is a
      thorny night, which is indented in the charcoal. Charcoal night
      is breathing shrilly, undeterrable tongues hallucinating in the
      keyholes, perforating the dust of what mouths utter. What is
      dictated is within the quenched constriction of wrangling invective,
      what limns the glittering coterie.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My ego is tedious. Is my ego
      my ego. Is my ego tedious. My ego is not tedious. Is my ego tedious.
      My ego is tedious. Is my ego tedious. My ego is not tedious.
      Is my ego not tedious. My ego is not tedious. Is my ego tedious.
      My ego is not tedious. Is my ego tedious. My ego is a tedious
      ego. My ego is an ego. My ego is tedious. Is my ego an ego. My
      ego is not an ego. My ego is not an ego, but only if it is an
      ego is it an ego, if it is tedious. Is my ego an ego if it is
      not an ego. My ego is not an ego, but only if it is tedious.
      My ego is not tedious. Is my ego tedious. My ego is tedious,
      but not too tedious. My ego is not tedious. My ego is tedious.
      My ego is my ego. My ego is tedious. My ego is not tedious. It
      is tedious. What is tedious. What is tedious about my ego. Every
      ego is tedious. Not any ego is tedious. Anything but an ego is
      tedious. A tedious ego is tedious. Every ego is not tedious.
      I am tedious. Are you tedious. Your tedious ego is not tedious.
      My ego is not tedious. My ego is my ego. Your ego is not tedious.
      My ego is not very tedious. Whose ego is this. It is not my ego.
      My ego is not my ego. My ego is not too tedious. I am tedious.
      My ego is not mine. My ego is not your ego. My ego is not even
      yours. The totality of my ego is not mine. It is not totally
      mine. Is it tedious if it is not totally mine. Is it tedious.
      Is it too tedious. Is my tedious ego all mine. Is it only mine,
      or is it only mine in part. Is it only all mine, or only all
      mine in part. Is it only an ego. Is it only mine in part. My
      ego is only partially mine. Partially it is all mine if it is
      tedious in part. I am partial to my ego. I am partly partial
      to my partial ego. In part, it is all mine. My tedious ego is
      my ego. Is it my ego. Is my ego mine. My ego is mine. My ego,
      my tedious ego is tedious. It is not tedious. My ego is not tendentious.
      The tendons in my ego are not tendentious. I am not tendentious.
      My ego is not tediously tendentious. It is not tendentious. What
      is my ego up to. The tenderloin of my ego is not tender. It is
      far from tender. It is not far from being too tender. It is not
      tender at all. My ego is not tender in all or in part. My tender
      ego is not tedious or tender. My ego is not tender. My ego is
      not tedious.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What is stiff devours what is
      undeterrable, the breath of abraded thorns, breathing a tongue
      of fire out of breath in the shivering of sleep, tongues of fire
      indelibly perforated, tormented, undeterrable thorns of turbulence
      exactly dismembered, torridly ignited: flushed shivering ordure,
      fierier decomposing shadows perfervidly affected, decomposing
      breaths of fire, the breath of sleep is a shadow perforating
      my limbs, my limbs intertwined with your limbs. We are indelibly
      tormented, we are the blood in the hallucinating dust, shadowy
      voices, velvety headstones, effected denunciations, austere stupors,
      tongueless shadows, shadowless, headless, fiery.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Bio:&nbsp; 54 years old, born
      in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, interested in mysticism, the 4th
      dimension of stillness, silence, the experience of timelessness;
      degrees from the Univ. of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins University,
      studying under John Ashbery, among others.&nbsp; Conscientious
      Objector during the Vietnam War.&nbsp; Came face to face with
      Jimmy Hoffa in Lewisburg Federal Prison (maximum security) on
      Oct. 1, 1970.&nbsp; Did most of my time in a prison camp called
      Allenwood with a bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses, a 2-star General,
      Carmine DeSapio, the ex-head of Tammany Hall, LBJ's sidekick,
      Bobby Baker, and a host of other interesting misfits. The camp
      was later made famous by convicts associated with Nixon's Watergate
      scandal.&nbsp; I rejected a Presidential Pardon from Gerald Ford.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
