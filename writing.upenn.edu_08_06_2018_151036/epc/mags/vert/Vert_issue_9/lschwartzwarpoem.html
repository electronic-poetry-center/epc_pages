        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What of old Mrs. Shea sprouting
        a beard, arguing with herself in the kitchen?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Oh, don't be alarmed, she's
        always that way, been daft for years and years, can't even hear
        her own voice.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Am I at home or in exile? All
        of us living in Baghdad now. (Stop this war with your ear.)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Certain villagers deep in the
        Vaucluse believe that a snake skin placed on the stomach will
        cure what ails you. She wouldn't know, she's from Amityville.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Judy halted in front of the
        birdbath. Its basin was half-filled with the unnameable.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The mind should be kept independent
        from the thoughts that arise within it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Impossible. Sleep impossible.
        No more than the next thought is possible.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">When my thoughts experienced
        a precision strike, images fell out of them at random.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A mobile kitchen had been set
        up not too far from there. The site was chosen at random. Whichever
        lucky refugees managed to make it out found the kitchen, seemingly
        god sent.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">A cormorant stood on a piece
        of reef far out in the Dry Tortugas. One was black, one was red,
        one was a darker red.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Words continue to arrive from
        monitors stationed at highly equipped tracking stations. The
        networks are excited, they are people, they enjoy attention.
        Generals speak in abstractions when obliged to speak, real philosophers
        in thoughts. The pots and pans bubble with poison. Do you hear
        them bubbling?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In big cities and little cities
        big people and little people pretend not to pause from their
        work. They pause from their work. (Stop this war with your ear.)</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">No sooner had the pleasure given
        me by certain books aroused the demon of wishing to write then
        another demon rose and swallowed up the first. There was simply
        nothing to say.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">My body tumbles into the ditch
        of language I've been forced to dig.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Let us not mince words, the
        letter the birds delivered was supposed to be a reminder of origin,
        a promise of salvation.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The act of simple naming the
        whole message itself.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The ringing of the other phone.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Primers of sound deposited in
        the marshy soil rise to the surface.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What of old Mrs. Shea sprouting
        a beard, cackling in the kitchen? Don't be alarmed, she's always
        that way, been daft for years and years, can't even hear her
        own voice.<BR>
