          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It begins with the killing of
          sparrows<BR>
          a baptism in the ancient ritual<BR>
          and moves slowly to the realignment of fences<BR>
          in this way, she keeps herself collected<BR>
          does not doubt her path, before or behind<BR>
          thinks Spring will look nice when it gets here<BR>
          in the countryside, the farmers have melted their pots<BR>
          and are waiting for harvest<BR>
          casting solitary shadows<BR>
          the moon is not to be counted on<BR>
          the dogs to guard the chickens<BR>
          seem a little mangy<BR>
          could do with a bath<BR>
          the huts lined as huts always are<BR>
          always seem more solemn at dawn and dusk<BR>
          it's the quality of the air<BR>
          and the scent of wild flowers<BR>
          that really hits home<BR>
          the face of your lover<BR>
          the cracks in your fathers hands<BR>
          the calculations involved<BR>
          as to whether this day is any better<BR>
          than the rest<BR>
          whether a circle is more pleasing <BR>
          than a square<BR>
          just how you got here<BR>
          and what you plan to do<BR>
          now that you have arrived<BR>
          perhaps you are drunk<BR>
          disoriented<BR>
          need an initiation to the city<BR>
          there is a museum to the northeast<BR>
          a burial plot to the southwest<BR>
          some restaurants and whores between<BR>
          she is keen on shopping<BR>
          knows exactly what kind of sweater<BR>
          she wants to buy<BR>
          thinks things are funny <BR>
          when they are not<BR>
          an utter lack of timing<BR>
          its almost comical<BR>
          the rain does not stop here<BR>
          she is prepared<BR>
          a shitty 10 kuai umbrella<BR>
          spokes beginning to bend in half<BR>
          as a disinterested bus driver <BR>
          pulls the number 25 from the stop<BR>
          making his way to the other side<BR>
          of the city, a rote destination<BR>
          among the bells of angry bicyclists<BR>
          and taxi cabs, pedestrians and shopkeeps<BR>
          a long morning followed by a long afternoon<BR>
          the sound of jiao hitting<BR>
          their metal depository<BR>
          the scent of over-performed women<BR>
          smiling beyond decency<BR>
          she spells her name phonetically<BR>
          thinks it makes more sense<BR>
          avoids the topics of unions<BR>
          train stations or anything Whitman related<BR>
          thinks England must be brown<BR>
          like in Dickens<BR>
          the grass is not stand-on grass<BR>
          and the guard is not so friendly<BR>
          there is no good place for kite flying<BR>
          too many buildings and power lines<BR>
          thinks Jasper is a good name<BR>
          for a parakeet or a second-born male<BR>
          but not the first<BR>
          thinks shit will hit the fan<BR>
          when shit must hit the fan<BR>
          but never before<BR>
          a question of moments and seasons<BR>
          migratory birds understand this<BR>
          better than Americans, most Chinese<BR>
          the benefit of doubting<BR>
          is a hesitation that appears stoic<BR>
          a crosstown taxi stuck at the light<BR>
          a train moored in the depot<BR>
          a boat in the doldrums<BR>
          something always breaks or gives<BR>
          the options are limited<BR>
          one or the other<BR>
          or a perpetual stalemate<BR>
          the stars grow pale in their constancy<BR>
          and blood is not wine<BR>
          despite the different symbols<BR>
          we may use to express ourselves<BR>
          an eye for an eye<BR>
          is understood<BR>
          she thinks Olympus is too far away<BR>
          that Spinoza and the East<BR>
          have much in common<BR>
          that the rosary<BR>
          offers a system for meditation<BR>
          as physical as Tai Chi<BR>
          thinks the woman in the restaurant <BR>
          works hard<BR>
          sells her food too cheaply<BR>
          would pay 1 or 2 kuai more<BR>
          and not complain<BR>
          thinks the West is dangerous<BR>
          a lover she cant refuse<BR>
          despite her misgivings<BR>
          wonders what her mother <BR>
          would think<BR>
          Dowager Wu<BR>
          Quiju who went so many times<BR>
          to receive the same justice<BR>
          like talking to a brick<BR>
          but the brick is a person<BR>
          and she is not quite human<BR>
          bones and silk must surely be made<BR>
          of different things<BR>
          but in the end<BR>
          are not so different<BR>
          like Jupiter compared to Pluto<BR>
          or to a fast moving vehicle<BR>
          the principles and dynamics<BR>
          form analogies<BR>
          she sometimes thinks<BR>
          a breakdown might be nice<BR>
          a big movie style one<BR>
          not the kind that you cant <BR>
          overcome<BR>
          stabled in the station<BR>
          tied to a tree<BR>
          it sometimes becomes a question<BR>
          of hope<BR>
          a .45 caliber shell<BR>
          a smash up on Highway 1<BR>
          the Sunday crossword<BR>
          that refuses to complete itself<BR>
          a walk in the desert<BR>
          the sounds of horns and hounds<BR>
          a wish for flood<BR>
          a wish for drought<BR>
          a king on the throne<BR>
          a vicar in the parish<BR>
          a cop on the beat<BR>
          the law of the past cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of the present and the future cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of the living cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of heroes cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of drunks cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of necessity cannot be eluded<BR>
          the law of luxury cannot be eluded<BR>
          but this, my only law, she thinks<BR>
          must surely give way<BR>
          must bend along the folds<BR>
          or tear like cheap cotton<BR>
          must lie limp in the heat of constellations<BR>
          must fail at every pass<BR>
          or else be eternal<BR>
          and I am not that proud<BR>
          a daughter of dirt and blood<BR>
          a physical fucking<BR>
          I am not that proud<BR>
          in the face of the living<BR>
          the dead and future corpses<BR>
          I am not that proud<BR>
          against the mountains and monuments<BR>
          against the platoons and cavalcades<BR>
          against the beggars and lepers <BR>
          I am not that proud<BR>
          against my own convictions<BR>
          I am not that proud<BR>
          though not devoid of reason<BR>
          albeit incidental<BR>
          a gondola in Venice<BR>
          is much different from one in Tongli<BR>
          a temple in Qingdao<BR>
          is much different than a cathedral<BR>
          in Rheims<BR>
          or a parish church <BR>
          in towns center Charras <BR>
          a dream of balloons<BR>
          and circus animals<BR>
          doesn't necessarily include monkeys<BR>
          but may<BR>
          if you think about it seriously<BR>
          she thinks monkeys must be clever<BR>
          beaten in Tai'an<BR>
          make bad pets<BR>
          but might make proper companions<BR>
          its all in the eyes<BR>
          the gestures<BR>
          like when you know someone likes you<BR>
          in that way or not<BR>
          you understand<BR>
          a pixie wheel<BR>
          a sit-n-spin<BR>
          a relationship<BR>
          or the ocean<BR>
          a scarf blowing in the breeze<BR>
          a flag on flag day<BR>
          the mast of large ships<BR>
          brought out for heritage's sake<BR>
          a stroll through the concessions<BR>
          a nickel in the fountain<BR>
          the antonym for exasperated<BR>
          kleptomaniac or eye spy<BR>
          with my little my<BR>
          the question of laowai<BR>
          without solid answer<BR>
          the sound of an empty room<BR>
          a heart's beating<BR>
          the feeling of floating<BR>
          the sensation of sinking, drowning<BR>
          the difference between<BR>
          she thinks philosophy<BR>
          belongs to the Germans<BR>
          a few French<BR>
          that flowers grow in their own time<BR>
          that the hothouse<BR>
          is an aberration<BR>
          that an invitation<BR>
          must be considered from both angles<BR>
          that dirt must be very heavy<BR>
          when you are tired<BR>
          that being tired<BR>
          must get wearisome<BR>
          a bad pair of shoes<BR>
          for such a long journey</FONT></P>
