      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's just one more thing I have
      to do. Like framing the letters of the <BR>
      alphabet. Or cutting a jigsaw puzzle by hand. I'd never guess
      that an <BR>
      ordinary philosophy could flow backwards. The woman in the room
      above makes <BR>
      her own corrections, as do the ladybugs their redundant vowels
      of <BR>
      immutability&quot;-- this red summer where red is a touched and
      tarnished thing. <BR>
      Here, all the characters eat meat. You see what they are thinking
      based on <BR>
      what someone else has said. And then lightning sparks the wood
      into fire. I <BR>
      was reading about swords and how they're made. I was looking
      at portraits. <BR>
      The woman in the one above, where the earth is a fanged and falling
<BR>
      perpetual sunset in pointillist fashion. So where does that leave
      the bees? <BR>
      Maybe without any sex, which would explain the angry buzz. There's
      an <BR>
      atmosphere of sound here that keeps keeping yourself from subtracting
      what <BR>
      could remain simple. Her thoughts wander a surface made whole
      hours pass <BR>
      past this earth of ours, asking, is there a warden in the garden,
      a leg of <BR>
      lamb on the plate. I am trying to listen. I am trying to throw
      straight.<BR>
      There are reasons for everything, and I know I am one. And inside
      where I <BR>
      made a whole day vanish completely, I was graceful in my theft.</FONT></P>
