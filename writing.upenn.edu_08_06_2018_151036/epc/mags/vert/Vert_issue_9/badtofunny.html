        ------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">An anticipatory hush falls
        over the Blue Room, an avant-garde art gallery in San Francisco's
        Mission District, transformed for one night into a performance
        poetry space. Plastic folding chairs creak under the weight of
        squirming bodies. Someone muffles a cough. A cell-phone bleat
        is stifled. The microphone crackles with feedback.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But it is utterly, almost uncomfortably,
        quiet by the time poet Dave Hadbawnik finally steps to the microphone.
        He is dressed up for the occasion, in a chocolate brown suit
        without a shred of natural fiber. This ill-fitting get-up, a
        '70s creation he found on the sidewalk for 2 bucks, will seem
        fitting attire in retrospect. No one scoffed at the shabby suit
        at the time, though, so engrossed were they in the artist and
        his &quot;art.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hadbawnik begins to read a
        free-verse masterpiece he wrote two decades ago, at age 18. Its
        subject, naturally, is the prom. His delivery is sincere, impassioned;
        the poesy earnest, wrenching, straight from the gut.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;For now let us dance
        across this wedding cake floor/ Knowing in the back of our dream
        drunk minds/ We will talk of this night/ Long after the helium
        has seeped out of these cheap balloons.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nervous titters and chuckles
        from the audience . . .</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I will spin you round
        and round until we create our own gravity/ Until we can't see
        the lies floating up from the dance floor like signals from a
        satellite.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Laughter bounces off the walls
        . . .</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;But we will stand alone,
        naked/ Shaded by trees of the most luscious fruit/ Hearing more
        truth in the silence than in the transient promises of a serpent's
        whisper.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Full-throated guffaws, followed
        by wild applause . . .</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This tour de farce, by a published
        poet with a creative writing degree from Wayne State University
        in Detroit, was a highlight of a recent two-hour festival of
        bad poetry. Intentionally bad. The wink-wink, get-the-irony kind
        of bad. The expose-yourself-to-ridicule-and-laughs bad. Ten Bay
        Area poets, some also published novelists with high literary
        street cred, shared their clunky castoffs, mangled metaphors
        and asinine alliterations for the fun and amusement of an audience
        that actually paid to hear it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Why? Because it's entertaining.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">You've heard the expression
        &quot;It's so bad it's good,&quot; right? Well, in this postmodern,
        ultra-ironic age, purposely bad performance by both professional
        artists and just plain folks seeking outlets of self-expression
        has become as hip, as de rigueur, in the Bay Area as using foreign
        words to feign sophistication.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Last month's &quot;bad poetry&quot;
        reading filled the seats and no doubt made scores of people log
        on to Amazon.com to find actress Suzanne Somers' seminal chapbook
        of free verse, &quot;Touch Me.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At the Odeon bar in the Mission,
        Monday is Bad Karaoke Night, where the powerful combination of
        off-key singers and wretchedly sappy pop tunes entertains scores
        until last call. And, appearing somewhere unannounced on a Muni
        bus near you, a duo called the Sub-Standard Comix entertains
        riders with purposely awful stand-up material -- perhaps to make
        the long ride seem even longer.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There's more bad out there.
        Lots more.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">BAD CAN BE GOOD</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In Fremont, a laid off dot-commer
        has found her true calling -- and significant Web traffic --
        by launching a site (www.miserablemelodies.com) devoted to achingly
        bad cover versions of popular songs. And San Jose State's annual
        salute to purple prose, the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, receives
        scores of really good bad entries each year. The winners have
        the media calling them as if they had won a Pulitzer.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is not a new concept, by
        any means. Bad art has been around since, well, art. Purposely
        creating it, and taking pleasure from its bitter fruits, is another
        matter, though.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Call it a &quot;mirror reversal
        ethic,&quot; says Oakland writer Rephah Berg, this year's Bulwer-Lytton
        winner.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Bad works, done the right
        way, are funny,&quot; Berg said. &quot;Normally we expect people
        to perform adequately at whatever they're doing. If they don't,
        a conflict exists between expectation and reality. That conflict
        can be exploited for the sake of humor.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Or, put another way, it's fun
        to mock the talentless. Even if it's yourself.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It's a post-irony thing,&quot;
        said Michael Smoler, one of the organizers of the Bad Poetry
        night. &quot;You've got to get to the other side of irony because
        it can become too fixed. Doing a bad reading is just breaking
        the monolith of taste. Art and poetry aren't there to tell people
        what's good.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps, but people know bad
        when they see it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I asked my brother, Greg,
        why people knowingly seek out bad movies, etc., and he replied,
        'Because people like to look at accidents,' said Sean Finney,
        one of the poets featured at the event. &quot;I see it as a way
        for people to communicate.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">THEN THERE'S JEWEL</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At the start of the poetry
        event, Smoler pointed to a table where a copy of turgid poems
        by pop princess Jewel was on display. The crowd laughed, ready
        to mock her as they later would the Somers offering. But Smoler
        gave the elite audience something to think about.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;OK, Jewel's poetry --
        but is it really bad?&quot; he asked. &quot;Maybe it saved somebody's
        life once. Maybe a girl didn't slit her wrists, and so that's
        good, right? Another question: Do we, as poets, need to be invited
        to be bad?&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bad is subjective, of course.
        The line between sentiment and schmaltz can be thin and ever
        changing. Andrew Felsinger, a poet and editor of the online art
        magazine VeRT, devoted an entire issue to the subject of bad
        art. He read a few of the poems he published in his magazine,
        to howls of laughter from the audience. But when Felsinger told
        the crowd in advance that his next line was written by Walt Whitman
        -- &quot;Through the scent of armpits in an aroma finer than
        prayer . . .&quot; -- the audience remained respectfully quiet.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;If it had been me who
        had uttered those words without the Whitman (attribution), it
        would have almost brought the house down,&quot; Felsinger said.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It wasn't all smirking irony
        at the poetry event. Hadbawnik said that the event showed the
        &quot;doubt and uncertainty&quot; some of the city's best poets
        feel, how a well-intentioned poem can go bad. The poets can &quot;get
        bogged down in the sentiment or the ego or trying too hard, which
        can be beautiful in its own way. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hadbawnik said that even bad
        poetry has value because it's sincere. He had to look no farther
        than his high-school masterpiece about prom night.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;When I wrote it, if someone
        had laughed at it the way people were, I would've been crushed,&quot;
        he said. &quot;It was not written to be bad or funny-- which
        makes it even funnier, I know. . . . In the unintentional comedy
        of it you could also be touched or moved by the sincerity, the
        naivete.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">GROANERS ON MUNI</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Insincerity, however, oozed
        across town at the intentionally bad stand-up comedy gig. San
        Francisco resident Al Cummings, the mastermind behind the Sub-
        Standard Comix, says he and his anti-comedic troupe want to anger
        &quot;people who are expecting a high standard and convince people
        that anyone can do this and this is a fun part of it, also.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Last spring, Cummings and pals,
        fueled by several drinks called Chernobyls (Mountain Dew and
        vodka), stood up in a crowded Muni 31-Balboa bus and told awful
        jokes that elicited groans and perverse laughter. Example: &quot;How
        do crazy people go through the forest? They take the psycho path.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Cummings' art may have been
        lost on some Muni passengers. But he recently did a set at a
        nightclub on California Street, and, he said, people &quot;got&quot;
        his willful badness. Cummings pointed to the cult success of
        anti-comic comic Neil Hamburger -- who purposely tries to be
        bad and succeeds every time, and even has had a few decent-selling
        CDs -- as the template for awful stand-up.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I mean, we label ourselves
        'substandard' so people will know,&quot; Cummings said. &quot;It's
        an ironic play on the whole stand-up thing.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At the Odeon bar, where Monday
        nights are dedicated to bad karaoke -- on- key singing is forbidden
        -- irony is scoured away. The participants are free to belt out
        a tune as agonizingly out of tune as they dare, without fear
        of mockery.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">D.J. Paul DeJong has hosted
        the bad karaoke for the past three months, and he knows what
        you're thinking: Isn't all karaoke bad karaoke? Yes, but he gives
        people permission not to even strive for mediocrity.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;We're not mocking the
        people singing at all,&quot; he said. &quot;It's more interactive.
        People will join in to help someone struggling through a song.
        It's refreshing to have someone step out of their normal role.
        Some karaoke singer who had really practiced and is good, that's
        just not as entertaining.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Karaoke crooner Scott Mary,
        who performed a dicey version of Elvis' &quot;Teddy Bear,&quot;
        said he liked the Odeon's noncompetitive style.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I feel intimidated at
        most karaoke places because everyone's going to take you seriously,&quot;
        Mary said. &quot;I lived in Nashville this past summer, and you
        had people seriously trying to get discovered at karaoke bars.
        I like this type of atmosphere because it's a human performing.
        You see the screwups and the real emotion.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">B MOVIES AND BEYOND</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Amateurs such as the Odeon's
        singers can be excused for singing poorly and accepted as entertainment
        on a benign level. But when celebrities produce truly bad works,
        it seems more satisfying for regular folks to mock. The Internet
        is chock full of sites devoted to B movies and the Ed Wood oeuvre.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That was the thinking behind
        Fremont resident Marion Briones' Web site dedicated to butchered
        songs, ones that started with good intentions but ended horribly.
        She pores over old vinyls at Rasputin Records, looking for gems
        such as William Shatner &quot;singing&quot; the Beatles' &quot;Lucy
        in the Sky With Diamonds.&quot; She's built up quite a collection,
        too, and shares them on her site, which she says averages about
        1,000 hits a day.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;My husband asks me how
        I can listen to this stuff,&quot; Briones said. &quot;I'm (a)
        classically trained (singer) and perfectly pitched. I don't know,
        it just strikes a funny nerve in me. Other people like it, too.
        To me, it wouldn't be funny if they were trying to be bad. But
        here we have pros who go into the studio and think they're producing
        real art.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Briones said that last year
        she received an e-mail from a woman in Bosnia saying she appreciated
        the laughs.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Another woman went into
        premature labor when she heard my copy of this frail, elderly
        German woman named Gerty Molzen singing Lou Reed's 'Take a Walk
        on the Wild Side,' &quot; Briones said. &quot;Wait until people
        hear my latest find -- my father has an album of old San Francisco
        49ers singing holiday songs. It's a classic.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps. But it will have a
        hard time beating out San Francisco fiction writer Beth Lisick's
        interpretation of Suzanne Somers' musings:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Touch me in winter, when
        darkness comes early and softness of fur surrounds my face/ Touch
        me not like a cat/ Or a tree or even a flower/ For I am more
        than all of these, but akin to them/ Touch me, I am a poet, a
        woman.&quot;<BR>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
        Bad stages</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bad entertainment, it seems,
        can be separated into three subgenres:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">-- The Elbow-in-the-Ribs Bad,
        wherein entertainers intentionally produce putrid performances
        to mock established norms of what's high and low art.<BR>
        -- The Scrape-Away-Irony-and-Expectation Bad, wherein regular
        zhlubs liberate themselves from trying to be hip and professional
        and just let loose.<BR>
        -- The Professionally-Bad-as-Enjoyable, wherein pretentions of
        celebrities are pricked and their lame attempts to cross over
        into a genre not their own are mercilessly mocked.</FONT></P>
