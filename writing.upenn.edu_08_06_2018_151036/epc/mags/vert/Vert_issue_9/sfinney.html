      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I could mention cars<BR>
      and bricks and streets retreating.<BR>
      You might mention leaves. No,<BR>
      I would mention leaves.<BR>
      You would mention something I would not expect,<BR>
      like that man's hands and this strange stone.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I would mention a lot of things
      in a series<BR>
      to try and get the feeling of speech<BR>
      rolling. Because actions don't quite match up,<BR>
      their thumbs opposing in an entirely <BR>
      different way than how words<BR>
      click each other off.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But it was speech, and I will
      miss it because<BR>
      some nets we've thrown to drown the squirmers<BR>
      Flop where we want them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Can you see now how hard it
      is <BR>
      to find the language that we'll never know?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Rocking back on our heels to
      celebrate the weaving we've accomplished<BR>
      the light is strong and scintillates the backs of trees.<BR>
      Shaved under my head in invisible ink the word<BR>
      No.</FONT></P>
