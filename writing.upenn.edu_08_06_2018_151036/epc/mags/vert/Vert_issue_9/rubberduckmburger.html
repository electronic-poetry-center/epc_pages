      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It's rare, or maybe it's common,
      that an object that was intended to have no particular significance,
      that was intended to be smiled at and given to a child or thrown
      away, would have this many meanings.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The history attached to an insignificant
      object&shy;the meaning of the object&shy;is unstable and unpredictable.
       As the duck moved off the manufacturing line, as it got sprayed
      and stenciled with its various markings, packed and shipped and
      distributed, all the while it was changing.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It was changing from a throw-away
      made-in-China party favor at a high-tech holiday bash to a marker
      for a particular point in time&shy;the time when corporations
      wanted to celebrate themselves with mementos both whimsical and
      cool.  The time, not long ago,  when young people were still
      astonished at their opportunities.  When it was all just starting.
       When it was starting to be what it would be, when it was becoming
      apparent that it was what it was.  When people were coming, and
      coming, and coming. When nobody knew exactly what it was, but
      everybody could tell it was happening: there were more people.
       There were more people looking for apartments, and paying more
      to share an apartment with more people.  There were more people
      looking for parking.  There were more people talking on the phone
      in more places, talking on the phone as they walked out into
      the middle of the street to hail a cab, as they stood in line
      at the check-out, as they paid their fare for the bus.  There
      were more restaurants.  There were more condos.  There were more
      people moving out of apartments that became condos.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There were jobs.  Everywhere,
      there were jobs.  It was hard to find someone who wanted a job
      who couldn't find one.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It didn't come out of nowhere,
      the particular revolution that came.  And it didn't come unannounced.
       The decentralization of data transmission was the obvious next
      step in penetrating further into the human capacity for being
      productized.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Though, surely, it must be more
      than that.  There must be some other capacity too.  Like Mussolini's
      trains.  Like the Roman aqueduct.  Like British schools and hospitals
      in India.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It may seem odd now, that so
      many had the spirit of the glowing, sunglassed rubber duck. 
      The whimsy, the swagger, the optimism, the kookiness.  It may
      seem odd that so many were ushered into instant prosperity without
      even knowing how it happened.  It may seem odd that anyone would
      speculate so wildly, that so many expectations were built on
      air.  It may seem odd that it could change so suddenly, it may
      seem odder still that it could happen at all.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">It may seem odd that these people
      who were needed were then suddenly not needed.  It may seem odd
      that people who thought they could take part in this, thought
      they were implicated in the nexus, were suddenly not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The confluence of meanings of
      the rubber duck&shy;the excess, narcissism, indulgence, immaturity,
      the playfulness, confidence, openness, curiosity, the commodification,
      the disposableness, the aggressive youthfulness, the vanity,
      the nostalgia...the multinationalism, the tiered globalization.
       </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The Chinese factories that brought
      millions from the countryside into the cities, transforming family
      into something not yet definable; the astonishingly unregulated
      manufacturing, the new kinds of injuries, diseases, and crime,
      the new societies that no one had expected and no one knew the
      rules for,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">The rubber duck that bought
      a house.  The outsize flood of money that buoyed up a floating
      toy.  The accidental jobs that helped buy everything.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">There are two of them, on the
      lid of the toilet tank.  Because it felt more companionable to
      have a pair.  And two, identical but slightly varied, different
      only in an ornamental detail, the presence of two nearly identical
      but pointedly varied in one discreet fact, declared the possibility
      of infinite numbers.  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">__________</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What percentage of Chinese workers
      have relocated from smaller inland cities or farmland to huge
      manufacturing centers on the coast since China began its industrial
      commodity expansion.  When can we way that actually began. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What percentage of the Chinese
      economy is invested in the manufacture of exported goods?  What
      percentage of imported goods in the US come from China?  What
      percentage of goods sold in the U.S. have some component manufactured
      in China?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What portion of the decrease
      in U.S. manufacturing jobs can be traced to expanded manufacturing
      in China?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">In what way did the tech boom,
      precipitated by the creation of the world wide web, rely on or
      partner with the increased manufacturing capabilities of China
      and other low-wage countries?  </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">__________</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">Rubber ducks may have evolved
      from the tradition of hunting decoys, somehow merged with the
      category of toys.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">On the internet, you can buy
      a wide assortment of different styles, colors, and sizes of rubber
      ducks.  Some of the ducks don't float, and are described as being
      for &quot;companionship&quot;, to distinguish them from floating
      ducks that can be used in the bath.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">But that seems like the most
      important thing about a rubber duck, that it can float.</FONT></P>
