        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">What if the weather were conditional-giddy<BR>
        as in response to a wild hair-if, in reverse, it were<BR>
        dependent on the flux of our disposition? <BR>
        Did it not rain because we cried tears of love.<BR>
        You say <I>when your gift unfurls, it will be fog.<BR>
        </I>I say throw caution to it.<BR>
        The ransom in low-flying clouds-<BR>
        you, frightened above these clouds in metal-underneath <BR>
        light a hundred-million years old, which <BR>
        seen through silhouetted holes in the sky<BR>
        makes me think I am older.<BR>
        If there were no fear in giving up control <BR>
        for comfortable flight, you could rest easy<BR>
        at the Villa Maria. <BR>
        The moon half over the horizon and I doubt<BR>
        you can see it-<BR>
        I wanna close my eyes-if the weather<BR>
        were quiet. <BR>
        I say you are welcome to embrace the morning.<BR>
        You say <I>everyday turns itself inside-out.<BR>
        </I>Nothing but the season-noting<BR>
        a summer's day, pretending I wasn't looking-<BR>
        oceans apart at dawn.<BR>
        I am merely a daydreamt perfectionist<BR>
        of loving our life wherever the future places it.<BR>
<BR>
        What coy language to unravel beneath bed-sheets<BR>
        visibly mussed-exploring our natures <BR>
        in dim light-the windows allowing a breeze.<BR>
        I am available for your surface <BR>
        to bond with my scarred skin <BR>
        and make a language of silences.<BR>
        You say <I>the curtain hits the cast.<BR>
        </I>I say I am beginning to breathe effortlessly.<BR>
        There is only the bay to cross.<BR>
        So, don't be afraid of the dark when <BR>
        the possibility of light exists-<BR>
        if only to enable the foresight of a future<BR>
        anxiously awaited-though<BR>
        the present hasn't been overlooked<BR>
        and we've lost nothing but physical nearness.<BR>
        No more prescience in the new model<BR>
        of everything loved.<BR>
        The peculiar disparity in time, in each location,<BR>
        where everything is present-your voice<BR>
        in time, laughter, a vendor in the periphery. <BR>
        You say <I>what better way, loving you from afar,<BR>
        where every small detail is beautiful in its station.</I> <BR>
        An avenue cobbled with petals unequal to <BR>
        the beauty of your lips.<BR>
        We say these words in our silence.</FONT></P>
