        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The following poem represents
        the second instance (as far as I know) of a new poetic form.
        Some blowhard from Illinois christened it the &quot;Mandrake.&quot;
        It involves the naming of poets. The stanzas alternate between
        roughly rhymed, and only accidentally metrical prophetic visions
        involving United States Poet Laureates, television sit-coms,
        and the occasional illicit sex or drug activity and prose sections
        mostly lifted from the works of such culinary luminaries as James
        Beard, M.F.K Fisher, and Elizabeth David. By the time one finishes
        reading the poem, one should have some ideas about what to do
        with poultry. The final stanza of the &quot;Mandrake&quot; must
        contain a personal reflection and a morel mushroom.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And I stepped out from behind
        the gauzy film<BR>
        draped in front of the dilapidated pear tree <BR>
        and behold! Mine own two eyes did see<BR>
        the headless corpse of my homeboy, Robert Pinsky.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dressing For Turkey Or Other
        Fowl With Oysters: Wing the oysters. Add the bread crumbs, oyster
        juice, and seasoning (salt, pepper, celery salt, paprika). The
        crumbs should be literally soaked in melted butter, as should
        all crumbs that go into a turkey. There are ten thousand variations,
        probably, but the general idea of using oysters as a flavoring
        is no new one to us, any more that it has been for some several
        thousand years to the Chinese.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
        <I>Beer: a robust English-style bitter.</I></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The flames raged ragingly about
        my head,<BR>
        the waters broke and crashed against my shins,<BR>
        I surveyed the land, looked below and above,<BR>
        And over yonder, behold! Stanley Kunitz making love to Rita Dove.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My mother's trick is to stir
        in a plump lump of honest butter just as the mixture is to be
        removed from the stove. Ah, that rich Victorian touch of the
        butter pat! Ah, the good, almost grainy texture, and the forthright
        ugly color of it in a sauce dish, with milk alongside or a slab
        of hot gingery molasses cake! Ah, nothing but applesauce-<BR>
        Beer: a pale summer lager.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I counted a great multitude of
        MFA students<BR>
        draped in crimson robes and eating leg of Lamb.<BR>
        And I watched and heard an eagle call out &quot;Woe!&quot;<BR>
        Then I settled into my couch and watched &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot;<BR>
        The episode in which Tony Danza gives a rim job to Robert Hass.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is important to note, however,
        that this act of appropriation is not the same thing as assimilation:
        Kent Johnson is not interested in becoming Japanese. What makes
        this book unique is that he does not set out to master Greek
        cooking, but continues to be his own poet, while learning to
        take advantage of what William Bennett has to offer. His Greek
        friends are as puzzled as they are appreciative of his efforts,
        for he takes their ingredients and their dishes and works them
        to his own taste, after his own manner. This act of heresy must
        have shocked American reviewers, but when you think about it,
        what he is doing is exactly right.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All of mankind then on the earth
        preferred Miracle Whip<BR>
        to regular mayo. There was weeping from the heavens.<BR>
        There was gnashing of teeth, tantrums, and a lot of bawlin'<BR>
        And then, behold! the seventh sign: Billy Collins smoking hash
        with Sonny Rollins.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Have the lamb boned and cut
        into one inch cubes. Slice the unpeeled aubergines into quarters
        and then into half-inch cubes, put them in a colander, sprinkle
        them with a tablespoon of salt, put a plate and a weight on top,
        and leave them for at least an hour so that the excess moisture
        drains out. This is good with a thick frosty mug of A&amp;W Root
        Beer.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then I saw in the right hand
        of he who discourseth on rectums,<BR>
        a simple silver book well-made and meet, a book with a flower<BR>
        and poems containing the secrets of misery and loss. <BR>
        Henceforth, I rubbed my prick and thought about Louise Gl&uuml;ck.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Poached chicken can be a delicious
        dish, especially when it is treated like the poule au pot of
        France or the pollo bollito of Italy. But it requires careful
        simmering-the merest bubbling. I lost my virginity to James Beard
        when I was a lad of fourteen. If you stuff the bird, be sure
        vent is well sewn up and covered or the broth will seep in and
        make the stuffing soggy. Poached chicken can be served either
        hot or cold. If serving cold, provide a cold liquid. Olde English
        800, for example.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the tenth hour there was a
        very severe earthquake<BR>
        that fractured the earth. From the smelliest fissure emerged<BR>
        a horrible beast that spoke as a dragon. He was good, roasted,
        with salt and cumin.<BR>
        Then the second angel spoke gravely thus: bring me the head of
        Maxine Kumin.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are two ways to boil
        rice correctly. There are several ways to skin a squirrel for
        Brunswick Stew. A small dab of butter will keep the pot from
        boiling over. One very simple casserole, which is delicious with
        baked ham, is made of lightly boiled noodles tossed with plenty
        of salt and pepper and one can of mushroom pieces which have
        been well-browned. Drink with chocolate milk. This is good with
        toast.</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The fifth hippie poured out his
        now-singed bowl, and rearranged<BR>
        the pillows on the sofa. He passed around the freshly packed
<BR>
        water pipe, and gathered with his friends to watch, behold! Starsky<BR>
        and Hutch. Somewhere else, Bill Merwin lunched with Joseph Brodsky.</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now, in my own life, I feel
        that the quiet drink I have before dinner with my lover, Shep,
        after the children have been tucked away is one of the pleasantest
        minutes in all the 1440. It makes the meal which follows seem
        more peaceful, more delicious. Physically it smoothes out wrinkles
        of fatigue and worry in both of us, which could, especially if
        we had been conditioned differently by wrangling parents, lead
        us inevitably into the Xanthippean tragedy of nagging, and bitterness,
        and anger, an oft-repeated theme of my boyhood, when I'd steal
        away into the woods and weep amongst the wild, vaguely phallic,
        morels.</FONT></I></P>
