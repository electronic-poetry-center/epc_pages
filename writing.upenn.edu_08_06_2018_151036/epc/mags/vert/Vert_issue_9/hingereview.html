        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I don't think of BOAS,
        I think of eight separate women.&quot; So writes Erin Wilson,
        a member of the Bay Area writing collective that created the
        anthology, <I>hinge</I>. In the anthology each poet presents
        ten to fifteen pages of poetry, followed by brief working notes,
        which explain how the writer thinks of her work and the collective.
        Like Wilson, I read <I>hinge </I>as a collection of eight distinct
        poetic projects. But I also see that all the contributors to
        <I>hinge</I> are engaged in a search. &quot;This book is not
        a document&quot;, writes Myung Mi Kim in her introduction. &quot;Rather,
        it documents with ardor&quot;. <I>hinge </I>feels like a live
        current, not a journey that's been concluded. The writers in
        <I>hinge</I> are active observers. They prefer to circle meaning
        rather than pin it down imprecisely. They allow silence and emptiness
        into their poems, preferring to acknowledge the limits of speech,
        vision, and memory.</FONT></P>
        <P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Searching while writing</FONT></U><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
        In <I>hinge, </I>the act of circling an idea, of searching and
        finding, or searching and not finding, is not edited out. In
        an excerpt from <I>The Grove,</I> Jean Lieske writes, &quot;place
        can teeter, fall / on one moment / then place, or its heft I
        must mean, / had settled me among the roots&quot; The line itself
        asserts the impossibility of stable knowledge, and the poet,
        by openly questioning her word choice, shows that this writing
        is an ongoing process.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In an excerpt from her poem
        <I>Manta Ray</I>, Nicole Stefanko continues this sense of gentle
        yet insistent searching: &quot;It was as if they had followed
        a horse through the plain many days and nights until it turned
        and walked toward them. No one acquiesced. They arrived, rather.&quot;
        The poet does not demand an answer, but accepts what finds her.
        In her working notes, Stefanko describes the subject of her poem
        (a type of fish) as &quot;a beautiful thing that is able to cover
        wide expanses and appears directionless, frightening/playful,
        openmouthed, filtering.&quot; In a way this describes <I>hinge
        </I>in general. These writers are not interested in finding answers
        so much as circling a question and getting close to what feels
        real.</FONT></P>

        &quot;Yet there was such a marvelous, such an extraordinary circumference
        around what I might or might not tell.&quot; Jean Lieske cites
        this quote by Barbara Guest in her working notes and in her excerpted
        poem. Images of horizons, frames and circles are frequent in
        <I>hinge,</I> indicating to me an interest in the limits of what
        can be seen or known. Guest's mention of circumference also brings
        to mind Emily Dickinson, for whom the best way to try to answer
        a singular question was to create a great circle around it. Going
        straight for the answer, or &quot;knock[ing] too heavily on the
        door,&quot; as Elise Ficarra writes in her working notes, will
        only &quot;hammer it shut.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">hinge</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1"
         FACE="Verdana"> teaches us that at times precision requires
        a willingness to say nothing, or to acknowledge that what is
        presented is only a guess. As Tsering Wangmo Dhompa writes in
        her poem, &quot;Irrevocably so &shy; a poem beginning with k&quot;,
        &quot;I am writing around you, because I am afraid of declaring
        too much.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not all the work in <I>hinge</I>
        is fragmented and full of pauses. Some of it comes in a rush,
        such as Sarah Rosenthal's boxed prose pieces. But these pieces
        also deal with the periphery, fascinated as they are with traffic
        circles and the chaos of the city, getting close to something
        that can't be expressed. &quot;We are standing off to the side
        looking at traffic. We are looking at one of those traffic circles.
        I'm not sure exactly what they're called, spaghetti circle, I
        think that's what my mother called them.&quot; As Rosenthal says
        in her working notes, the boxes pretend to contain the text,
        making it seem final and complete. But in fact the dark lines
        only enhance the chaotic feeling of what's inside them.</FONT></P>
        <P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Listening, looking</FONT></U><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
        Each of Rosenthal's boxed pieces begins with a subject-verb action
        in bold type: &quot;We are standing&quot;, &quot;I am staring&quot;,
        &quot;I am standing or sitting&quot;, &quot;I am sitting&quot;,
        &quot;I am talking&quot;. The poet is in the center looking out,
        observing, seeing circles. The phrases move from an outside observer,
        &quot;staring&quot;, to a speaker who is acting or &quot;talking&quot;.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Erin Wilson's poems also move
        between action and observation. In the poem &quot;if this were
        simply a field&quot;, she writes, &quot;as the hero I purchased
        a train ticket / trailing fields and backyards / in Sandusky
        the wide arched windows, double arched doors / the station stood
        above tracks / I looked down onto the movement&quot;. The poet
        observes from above, not herself but an actress playing herself,
        standing on the elevated train track. From this removed position,
        she observes the majestic doors and windows of the town, sees
        the activity from far away. The experience of removed attention
        returns in another of Wilson's poems: &quot;When I am paying
        bills I turn on the light. It makes the room very bright. Then
        I think, I am doing this, this is being done. Look at the way
        I pay bills&quot; Another of Wilson's poems describes an art
        piece that involves translating brain waves into music. The idea
        of such a direct translation of human thought is comical next
        to Wilson's questioning of her ability to even experience a singular
        moment. How could a thought be experienced, observed and translated,
        all at once? Something must be lost in the process.</FONT></P>
        <P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Silence, emptiness, invisibility</FONT></U><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
        &quot;the sun rose on the far side / only one palm holding open
        my eyes / like listening which is filling / no fingering of small
        emptiness&quot;. In this poem, Wilson compares the horizon line
        to the frame of the eye. The image somehow brings a sensation
        of darkness; maybe it's the possibility of the eye shutting permanently
        if the hand lets go. This looking is &quot;like listening,&quot;
        and listening &quot;is filling&quot;. Silence is active. It participates
        in the conversation and fills space. In <I>hinge, </I>there's
        the sense of silence not only in the white spaces, but also between
        the words and lines. As Wilson says, this emptiness can't be
        touched, but the reader can fill it. Dhompa writes, &quot;Spoken
        to, there is a listener.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In &quot;arrival&quot;, Stefani
        Barber writes, &quot;moving among these bodies was like being
        invisible but it fit, a comfortable less-weight.&quot; As in
        Wilson's poem, Barber or her narrator experiences the world from
        a removed position. Being invisible is comfortable because there
        is less pressure to <I>know.</I> To some degree, the poet's perception
        depends on not being seen, or on not feeling pressured to find
        answers. Elise Ficarra, in an excerpt from <I>the dog letters</I>,
        seems to remind the reader not to take these words as fact: &quot;(don't
        mistake this noise for something solid / stocking up on soup
        cans)&quot;.</FONT></P>
        <P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Knowledge, memory</FONT></U><FONT
         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
        The writers in <I>hinge</I> are interested in precision, and
        this means examining experience and the blur that is memory.
        Wilson writes, &quot;forgotten, then the day comes, I forget
        again / somehow without remembering&quot;. Here she gets at the
        constant tug of memory, the feeling of something always slipping
        through our fingers. Is it the past? This moment that has just
        ended? Is it lost? Memory may be slippery, Wilson seems to say,
        but it is strong: &quot;He's forever part of your life now, having
        driven out of sight.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In her working notes, Sarah
        Rosenthal calls memory &quot;an act of creation.&quot; <I>hinge</I>
        questions our ability to know anything for sure, at the same
        time demonstrating a great belief in writing's usefulness in
        the search for meaning. Perhaps writing can never truly hold
        the chaos of the mind, or make sense of the thousand memories
        and sensations that shake us each moment. But as Lauren Schiffman
        writes in <I>Mirror Mirror: The Cock Poems</I>, writing can be
        a bridge. It can provide a path for searching, a way to navigate
        between shifting unknowns and between past and present: &quot;The
        words we toss between us / become a net, a web, / a womb. I'm
        suspended here, / lying back cushioned by this space / between
        us, where little I-girl / and I both live, where we're on / our
        own.&quot;</FONT></P>
