  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2. On a trip to Manhatt<I>e</I>n
  in May 2001, I lay <BR>
  on my friend Rachel's cream-colored couch, <BR>
  freezing. In two more days I'd have a <BR>
  ferocious head cold. I was too cold and far <BR>
  away from myself to get up and change into <BR>
  the warm pants I had in my bag, I was <BR>
  wearing a flimsy, sexy wraparound dress I'd <BR>
  bought at Macy's for $30. Bare legs and <BR>
  open-toed shoes. Purple toenails matching <BR>
  stripes in the dress. I felt femme on Rachel's<BR>
   couch. Rachel has always had a strong, <BR>
  capable, androgenous presentation though <BR>
  she can look exciting in a dress when she <BR>
  wants to. At our friend Mindy's wedding in <BR>
  1995 she wore a black backless number with <BR>
  pearls. But mostly she looks androgynous, <BR>
  sporty - I don't want to say butch because she <BR>
  hates gender boxes. I used to do my Rachel <BR>
  imitation, that lasted many years. Now I do <BR>
  my Laurie imitation. Laurie is my newer <BR>
  friend, she dresses extremely femme and has<BR>
   had a big influence on me because she flaunts <BR>
  her body and feels safe. So there I was in my <BR>
  full-on Laurie imitation. My dyed hair. <BR>
  Rachel's going gray naturally, she gains <BR>
  power from gray, for me it feels weak <BR>
  because I want only men. She was frustrated <BR>
  with herself for not showing interest more <BR>
  strongly in a woman she liked. I wasn't so <BR>
  sure about it but we are far apart, see each <BR>
  other rarely, you have to accept. Nod. <BR>
  Challenge but within limits. You are <BR>
  gathering information. There on the shelf <BR>
  another classmate from Brown, his new <BR>
  hardback book. I've known him only as Jake <BR>
  but on the book it said Jacob. I can't even <BR>
  keep up with his accomplishments. Like <BR>
  Rachel he moved straight to Manhatt<I>e</I>n after <BR>
  graduation. He gets more and more famous, <BR>
  in media things. In medias res. In the middle <BR>
  of it all. &quot;In or into the middle of a plot.&quot; <BR>
  Manhatt<I>e</I>n, in other words. They should put <BR>
  that in the dictionary. These are terrified <BR>
  times. They should put that in the dictionary. <BR>
  There should be a word for that. Rachel gave <BR>
  me a cup of herbal tea. She sat on the floor in <BR>
  front of me and we talked about work, <BR>
  relationships. I had just helped out with my <BR>
  cousin Susan's wedding, a few blocks north, <BR>
  walking distance. Penthouse, views. That's <BR>
  where I caught the head cold, because the air <BR>
  conditioning blasted on every twenty <BR>
  minutes. Paul loaned me his suit jacket and I <BR>
  got food on the sleeve, and he was nice about <BR>
  it. Susan's cake was from a bakery that's the <BR>
  latest find, terrible service and bad coffee, <BR>
  delicious heavy pastries loaded with flower <BR>
  decorations like a country garden. She saved <BR>
  hundreds by getting one tier. Her sister Carrie <BR>
  and I picked it up in a cab, the driver <BR>
  promised to be careful but he drove fast over <BR>
  bumps. The cake arrived unharmed. I ended <BR>
  up in a leadership role, marshalling people <BR>
  through the photograph session. Late that <BR>
  night, in the kitchen, Susan's mother <BR>
  Charlotte was internal. Paranoid from lack of <BR>
  sleep I said, Is it me. Was I mean to the <BR>
  guests. No sweetheart she said kindly, <BR>
  shocked, taking my face between her two <BR>
  hands the way she does. The first time I met <BR>
  Charlotte was when I was a kid, one time in <BR>
  Chicago, she had black hair then. The second <BR>
  time was in front of a big building in <BR>
  Manhatt<I>e</I>n when I came to stay with Hannah <BR>
  en route to Israel. Her hair had gone <BR>
  completely white, it looked great with her red <BR>
  hat and blue coat. She was like a painting of a<BR>
   woman by a man who really liked women. <BR>
  Bright primary colors and solid outlines. Like<BR>
   her looks her warmth was both generous and <BR>
  contained. Her adoption of me immediate. <BR>
  We went into some kind of basement science <BR>
  exhibit, there was popcorn though I doubt we <BR>
  ate it. Later when I went to Brown, I would <BR>
  come to visit often. There are photos of me <BR>
  sitting in the Golds' living room, which <BR>
  hasn't changed much in decades, lots of <BR>
  orange and plants. Rachel's living room is <BR>
  dominated by books, a shelving unit the<BR>
  length of her living room. She went to the <BR>
  kitchen to put on the kettle again. I got up <BR>
  and poked among the books till I found the <BR>
  Blue Riders catalog. We had gone to the <BR>
  Guggenheim one time to see an exhibit. By <BR>
  the end we understood everything. She <BR>
  bought the book. I've never recaptured it. <BR>
  Rachel's apartment layout is identical to our <BR>
  friend Muriel's Aunt Sonya's place, or Sunny <BR>
  as she's called by her family. One long living-<BR>
  dining room, convenience kitchen, square <BR>
  bedroom off to the side. Once during college, <BR>
  when Sonya was away, Muriel, Rachel, me, <BR>
  and some others spent the weekend at her <BR>
  place. It was jammed with tiny beautiful <BR>
  objects, one of which we broke, an egg from <BR>
  Russia I think. Photographs by Sonya of poor <BR>
  kids in Manhatt<I>e</I>n in the early century. She <BR>
  had been a student of Lewis Hine. We ate <BR>
  brunch at her table, took the subway to MTV <BR>
  where Rachel's big sister had a powerful job. <BR>
  Abby gave us free MTV buttons, square like <BR>
  TVs, with lots of yellow. We felt lucky. She <BR>
  was short and sardonic and warm, as if she'd <BR>
  already met all of us. I flipped through the <BR>
  Blue Riders book, then peeked at a draft of <BR>
  some education report Rachel was putting <BR>
  together for a leading institution of higher <BR>
  education. I can't get into how accomplished <BR>
  Rachel is. She's power, like Abby. Photo of <BR>
  her dad shaking hands with Kennedy. Sinatra <BR>
  playing on the stereo in her parents' house in <BR>
  Armonk when I visited during Brown days. <BR>
  Her mom's bag of paper-thin-sliced bagels <BR>
  on the kitchen counter. Me projecting my <BR>
  own misery onto that when really her mom <BR>
  was just on some little diet, not trying to wipe <BR>
  herself off the planet. Rachel returned with <BR>
  my tea and I sipped as fast as I could, I had a <BR>
  flight early the next morning. I asked her for <BR>
  an update on her parents. I've been blessed, <BR>
  she said, My parents both gave me so much, <BR>
  it is a joy to give in return. Her mom has <BR>
  been battling cancer. She is a great therapist <BR>
  which she didn't even learn to do till late. <BR>
  Rachel walked me to the subway. By then I'd <BR>
  changed into my warm clothes and felt better, <BR>
  we're good at connecting within a time <BR>
  budget. When I got back to the Golds' Max <BR>
  was getting ready for bed, Carrie was <BR>
  sleeping, Charlotte was moving solitary in <BR>
  her kitchen. Putting things away, thinking. I <BR>
  said, &quot;Was I too bossy with the photos?&quot; <BR>
  &quot;Too bossy? You? Of course not, dear,&quot; she <BR>
  said, smiling, taking my face in her warm <BR>
  hands and pressing her head into my neck the <BR>
  way she does. I went into the dark bedroom I <BR>
  was sharing with Carrie. The day before, I <BR>
  had spent more than an hour in the living <BR>
  room ironing the antique lace tablecloth that <BR>
  had been donated for the huppa. It was a big <BR>
  deal that I was given this chore. Max, <BR>
  Charlotte and Carrie all kept gently checking <BR>
  on me and telling me what a help I was. I was <BR>
  trying to do it just like Hannah would, they l<BR>
  ove her precise Germanic nature, the Golds <BR>
  are German Jews and our family is half that <BR>
  half Christian. How would Hannah do it? The <BR>
  folds kept piling up on the floor and getting <BR>
  wrinkled again. The iron was old. Finally it <BR>
  had to be enough. Carrie and I wrapped it <BR>
  around a hollow cylinder Charlotte had <BR>
  acquired. I wish I could remember the <BR>
  original purpose of the cylinder, it had one. <BR>
  The next morning, the morning of the <BR>
  wedding, Max and I went to buy bagels and <BR>
  coffee. We walked north on Broadway a few <BR>
  blocks to find something open that early. He <BR>
  said, &quot;I've realized that different <BR>
  relationships bring out different sides of a <BR>
  person. Susan's last relationship was with <BR>
  someone opposite from Phil.&quot; Susan and Phil <BR>
  are living in Columbia student housing while <BR>
  he finishes his degree. Susan's a shrink. She <BR>
  provided shrink referrals for my friend Laurie <BR>
  who recently moved to New Jersey with <BR>
  Matthew, commuting distance from <BR>
  Manhatt<I>e</I>n where Matthew got a law job. The <BR>
  firm he almost worked for was in the World <BR>
  Trade Center; the firm where he accepted a <BR>
  job has cleared an entire floor of its office <BR>
  space for the other firm to help it get back on<BR>
  its feet. Susan and Carrie both keep telling <BR>
  me about this great photo of Carrie and me <BR>
  taken by my aunt Renate at the wedding, but <BR>
  I still haven't gotten a copy of it.</FONT></P>
