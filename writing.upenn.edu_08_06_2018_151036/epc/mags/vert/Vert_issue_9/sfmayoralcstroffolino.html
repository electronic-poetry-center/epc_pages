      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Found out last night about Willie
      Brown (who I really wanna like, because he looks so jovial in
      that picture with Sean Finney at that party where he was chatting
      up Huey Lewis) having claimed Gonzalez is racist. Woke up today
      to KPOO (ah KPOO---they seem very bent on spelling out the letters
      and not saying &quot;POO&quot;). They got Gonzalez on (asked
      Newsom; of course he was too busy) to defend himself against
      these charges, on a largely black owned/operated station. G did
      admirably, even if at times it seemed that some of the callers
      might have been &quot;plants.&quot; Yeah, hoping people see through
      all this Newsom stuff (according to Gonzalez, Brown backs Newsom
      because he wants to maintain a stake in PUC appointments for
      interest, and many of the people of color Gonzalez voted against
      were actually Brown's attempts to get people whose field of expertise
      was on one committee over to another committee in which these
      people had no expertise, and were thus willing to go along with
      whatever Brown/Newsom wanted/wants---the interests of big business).
      Ah, yes, a typical good-guy/bad-guy story this---but, hey, a
      better sport than Yankees/Red-Sox or the &quot;total recall.&quot;
      It seems much more important that Gonzalez win than it did that
      Gray Davis did; it feels that the electoral stakes in San Francisco
      as a kind of city-state is much more important than any other
      place I lived. What else? Oh yeah, then after getting cut off
      by a truck on my bike today and then getting a ticket for running
      a red light (when I was forced to run it to avoid the truck---ah,
      police!), I arrive home to SMEAR-FLIERS. 3 from Newsom. One with
      Gonzalez with a big ME on it (he only cares for himself; voted
      himself a big raise), another about how Gonzales doesn't want
      to protect women victims of sex crimes, and a third about how
      Gonzalez does not have a commitment to education. He's firing
      on all fronts, isn't he? But that article in the Guardian about
      Newsom's inability to pay for all his attempted programs (because
      he wants to cut the rich a big tax break) seems very sound to
      me, and of course, the first things to go will be things like
      school funding, art funding. As for safe streets, and good old
      proposition M, I'm sure more police presence will certainly help
      matters (ha, ha). That's what Angela Aliota (spelling?) wanted
      too. Of course she supports Newsom. At least Ammiano finally
      endorsed Gonzales, but, biking through the Castro alot, I notice
      that where once was Ammiano signs there are now many Newsom signs.
      I think that's because many of the rich conservative gays would
      accept the liberal Ammiano because he was gay, but now that he's
      out of the race, their money-politics matters more than their
      social politics. But I still think more gays are going with Gonzalez;
      hard to tell (and, no, I don't mean to imply that Ammiano's supporters
      were only gay). The poles maintain it's close; there are signs
      in many windows, the city seems divided, and it's kind of cozy
      in that. I take mental notes to see certain electrical union
      hall (near Duboce Park) has a big Newsom sign on it. Oh yeah,
      the Gonzalez flier that arrived in the mail today, said, &quot;NEWSOM
      CLAIMS HE'S A DEMOCRAT (to the left of howard the dean at that),
      BUT, LOOK, HE GAVE $500 RTO GEORGE BUSH.&quot; And I think in
      many ways that sums it up. What used to be Democrat is now Green;
      what used to be Republican is now Democrat. I've been trying
      to find a Gonzalez button for weeks; and I always arrive at the
      HQ at the wrong times. I guess I gotta settle for my Edwin Torres'
      &quot;Shock Worker&quot; button (which fortuitously is the same
      colors).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dec. 3rd</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">So, I finally got my Gonzalez
      button. Also picked up today's Guardian and<BR>
      SFWeekly, and the first thing I had to read was Garrett Kamps'
      poll of their<BR>
      5 favorite albums &quot;of all time&quot;. I gotta repeat it
      here.<BR>
<BR>
      Newsom--<BR>
      1. R.E.M.--Automatic for the People<BR>
      2. Santana, Supernatural<BR>
      3. Coldplay--A Rush of Blood To the head<BR>
      4. Miles Davis, Kind of Blue<BR>
      5. (any KFOG: Live from the archives CD)<BR>
<BR>
      Gonzalez--<BR>
      1. John Coltrane--Live Trane<BR>
      2. The Clash--London Calling<BR>
      3. Joy Division--Les Bains Douches<BR>
      4. Pavement--Slanted and Enchanted<BR>
      5. Led Zeppelin I<BR>
<BR>
      Kamps' article is hilarious, in terms of what it says about the
      character of<BR>
      each. Now I'll have to wear my Gonzalez button to the Malkmus
      show tonight I<BR>
      suppose. And, now, I'm also thinking I'm really glad that they
      didn't ask<BR>
      them what their 5 favorite poems, or poets, are. I know G likes
      some good<BR>
      poets, but I betcha he doesn't even know our work Andrew and
      if by chance he<BR>
      knew some contemporary poet it'd probably be one of those overrated
      ones the<BR>
      eldsters have pushed forth. This would not be a fault of Gonzalez
      of<BR>
      course---and maybe I'm wrong--but I just betcha that his taste
      in poetry<BR>
      (especially were it contemporary poetry) would not be nearly
      as hip in my<BR>
      opinion as his taste in music. Anyway, I'm absolutely sure Newsom's
      would be<BR>
      worse (if he even had it). KIND OF BLUE is cool and everything,
      but the<BR>
      other ones? <BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The title of this is symbolic,
      but contains an element of truth. But, I'm<BR>
      writing today because I realize my last installment ran the risk
      of<BR>
      emphasizing the &quot;circus' over the &quot;bread&quot; (yeah,
      Gonzalez has hipper music<BR>
      taste, so what---wouldn't you rather have a mayor who likes a
      musician who<BR>
      is dating a starlet than one who love tore apart?). The question
      of &quot;hip&quot;<BR>
      vs. &quot;geek&quot; could actually play into Newsom's hands,
      but luckily today I was<BR>
      reminded of other (the so called &quot;real&quot;) issues at
      stake as well. It stopped<BR>
      raining enough for me today to do my bike-ride again (yes, sunny
      days are<BR>
      more Gonzalez days, if &quot;voter turnout&quot; logic has any
      say in the matter), and<BR>
      somewhere---I think at Haight and Divisidero---saw a telling
      sign, an<BR>
      apartment house with Gonzalez signs in the lower window and Newsom
      signs in<BR>
      the upper window. Now I can't assume, or generalize from my own
      experience,<BR>
      that this means that the upper window signifies &quot;landlord&quot;
      and the lower<BR>
      window signifies &quot;tenant&quot; (though I would love to be
      a bug in the wall as<BR>
      the upper and the lower pass each other in the hallway), but
      when I returned<BR>
      home there was a Gonzalez flier (all in red) &quot;I strongly
      back rent<BR>
      control...&quot; etc. and I swiped it quick before my landlord
      got it (it was not<BR>
      addressed---but assume it was more meant for us than the landlord).
      I will<BR>
      not get into the issues in depth here, but I'm writing this in
      part because<BR>
      I was talking to another friend today, who told me, &quot;oh,
      you know Newsom<BR>
      isn't so bad, when it comes down to it,&quot; and I found myself
      more<BR>
      passionately arguing about all the things Gonzales wants to do---even
      if he<BR>
      won't be able to do them (for instance, as mayor of San Francisco
      he's<BR>
      likely not to make a dent in CLEARCHANNEL's censoriuous near-monopoly
      of the<BR>
      music industry, though he did speak with some authority that
      he may be able<BR>
      to keep Muni rates at present levels, and maybe even lower them<BR>
      significantly)---that Newsom doesn't. Sure, if Newsom will continue
      many<BR>
      Brown policies, one can say it won't be as bad for the city as
      Schwarten is<BR>
      for the state, or Bush for the government. It won't become MORE
      conservative<BR>
      and repressive here (though prop M and other things might give
      one pause),<BR>
      but it certainly won't change for the better, and when it comes
      down to it<BR>
      there's been more than enough slippage of social programs and
      social vision<BR>
      in government since the mid-late 70s that the fact that Gonzalez
      is not<BR>
      willing to settle simply for maintaining some of the existing
      social<BR>
      services, etc, that are gradually being whittled away (especially
      in the<BR>
      larger context of what's happening nationally), but is actively
      wanting to<BR>
      try to stem the tide by considering other ways (that aren't just
      trying to<BR>
      pour money on the problem, but are more grassroots), is something
      to vote<BR>
      for. </FONT></P>
