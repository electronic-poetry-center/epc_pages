      <A HREF="http://www.mattgonzalez.com/">Matt Gonzales</A>, Green</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Matt Gonzales is round, Gavin
      Newsom is flat. Gavin's photo as teenager in<BR>
      morning <A HREF="http://www.sfgate.com/">Chron</A> exudes suspicious
      Modesto innocence of whatever his name was<BR>
      in American Grafitti. Glad-handing and feeding off and feeding
      the Rich<BR>
      Elders.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Matt's high school photo, the
      long sideburns, thin angular face suggests &quot;I<BR>
      will be your teen idol&quot; in that New Jersey wannabe crooner
      Italian mode -<BR>
      &quot;Even if we don't go all the way, I will whisper sweet nothings
      in your ear<BR>
      and make you feel like you can be with your friends and let on
      like we've<BR>
      really done it, anyway.&quot; A much harder read - the sensual,
      imaginative<BR>
      physical in blend with the political righteous.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Newsom is a spoiled brat
      subsidized by the Getty family. Gordon Getty does<BR>
      not want to be Mayor. He just wants a pawn, a little shit like
      Newsom that<BR>
      he can tell what to do.&quot; Retired Shriner, City native, 79
      years old, Noe<BR>
      Valley Bar &amp; Grill, 24th &amp; Church.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;We went out on a date.
      I will never forgive him for not walking me all the<BR>
      way home, but I'm still definitely voting for him.&quot; Young
      woman with yellow<BR>
      on black Gonzales button, smiling, as if she still got something,
      getting<BR>
      coffee at Tartine's.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Three Newsom people came
      to my door. 'Aren't you in the wrong<BR>
      neighborhood?' I asked them. They didn't care. They kept pushing
      posters and<BR>
      bumper stickers at me. I am sure they were getting paid and had
      to get rid<BR>
      of the stuff to show their bosses that they did their work.&quot;
      My 26 year old<BR>
      son, Lucas, at home in the Mission near General Hospital.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When, one by one, the Gonzales'
      young come to my door - at least three times<BR>
      last week - they often seem about to giggle, as if political
      virgins<BR>
      carrying a giddy secret, a special possibility, as if Matt is
      a fertile<BR>
      goat, a few votes away from leaping full born out of the electoral
      cradle.<BR>
      Someone who promises to mate with City desires.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I voted for Matt the first
      time. Now I don't know. Did you read the<BR>
      Independent this morning. He's got the support of Wong, the Developer,
      who's<BR>
      also taking down forests in the Amazon. How can he still be Green?&quot;<BR>
      Thirty-something woman outside the Dolores Caf&eacute;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I am worried about Matt.
      Art Agnos is behind him. Agnos is the one who<BR>
      caused the homeless problem in the first. One of them - either
      Newsom or<BR>
      Matt has to do something about the homeless. Everyday in this
      town it's like<BR>
      running the gauntlet.&quot; Another woman outside the Dolores
      Caf&eacute;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I want to vote for a guy
      who can afford a hair cut at Isa's.&quot; Isa at Isa's<BR>
      Hair Salon. &quot;I guess you know who I am voting for.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;It's only because you own
      buildings, Isa.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Matt's campaign surrounded by
      dark and light.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">18th and Guerrero - the Mission
      - is Gonzales territory. Not an apartment,<BR>
      and often several, with one or more windows checkered with &quot;Matt
      Gonzales&quot;<BR>
      signs. Instinctively the young prefer the round to the stiff.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then there is always the turf
      war - the one who will protect rent control<BR>
      and the one - backed by the Landlords - who will take it away.<BR>
      Gonzales, the fertile goat ready to mate with the imaginative
      soul of the<BR>
      City. Gavin, the shielded cow, once elected, all udders ready
      for the<BR>
      corporate pulling. The City as Muse - the dignified, classy,
      sexy lady who<BR>
      is ready to dance - either fiercely or slowly - no matter in
      the light or<BR>
      the dark. Versus the City as the unimaginative, much drained,
      trammeled<BR>
      upon, borderline, hardly working, used-up, sad, Civil Service
      whore.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the eyes of many it's the
      risk of poetry versus an exhausted, predictable<BR>
      prose. Matt is considered a friend of poets and a great reader
      and public<BR>
      supporter of poetry. Recently, at a &quot;Poetry Reading for
      Gonzales.&quot; he was<BR>
      able to identify about 20 photographs of the 19th and 20th Century
      poets on<BR>
      the poster, and, more recently, helped lead the San Francisco
      Library's<BR>
      celebration of the 100th birthday of Carl Rakosi.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Secure investments versus sensuality,
      imagination, risk and desire. Why one<BR>
      first comes and the young continue to come to the City.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The City Trembles - Youth going
      to a war it wants, and, insistently wants to<BR>
      win. To regenerate the City, anew.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It will be a cliff hanger. Or
      a flaming loss. Vote.</FONT></P>
