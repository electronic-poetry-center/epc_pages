        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma">I was baked mute<BR>
        and talking interest through chicken<BR>
        <I>pass the X</I>, the Beloved said, <I>give me more Y</I><BR>
        from the slain fell gravel<BR>
        in the butter dish horse souls<BR>
        marched like feverish armies<BR>
        so much music in the trivial<BR>
        each day a reconstituted dream<BR>
        of another reconstituted dream<BR>
        if we could untie things and<BR>
        discuss freedom the way we break eggs<BR>
        but in our revealing tangle opera resumed<BR>
        dinner more sordid milk<BR>
        as the Beloved gave her best high sullen<BR>
        calm got abstract<BR>
        and under needle lights streets purpled<BR>
        the teeth spirits were blocked<BR>
        from the their usual mission<BR>
        our windows covered in bark<BR>
        our glass grown suspicious with age<BR>
        and row upon row of stolen lemons<BR>
        seersucker never fit for fall<BR>
        there was blood in my wrong<BR>
        there was blood in my clasps<BR>
        there was blood in my music<BR>
        after dinner we entered a new phase of Wilson criticism<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call it post-favorable<BR>
        I think her recollection circuitry was malfunctioning<BR>
        but that could be the evil I waking<BR>
        or the result of snow chemistry<BR>
        love beautiful and me legs me hot me green me rage me time<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me continent me bell me still me
        night me road me<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while me wires me mother me<BR>
        time finished with a snap<BR>
        but I was fixed for cash</FONT></P>
