        Poetics at SUNY Buffalo<br>
        in the Department of Media Study</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the <font color="#CC9900">Department 
        of Media Study</font> we have a solid history of extremely innovative 
        practice, engaging faculty with which to work, and plenty of opportunities 
        for you to forge your artistic path. The Department of Media Study digital 
        arts program is the first founded in the United States, founded in 1979 
        by Gerald O'Grady and Hollis Frampton. We have a long tradition of support 
        for independent media production and criticism with an emphasis on the 
        moving image, using film, video and programmable media. This extends to 
        our truly exceptional offerings of studies in Digital Poetics. With its 
        literary tradition, its state of the art facilities, and its tradition 
        of uncompromising radical practice, it is no surprise that Buffalo is 
        the place where digital poetics is being pioneered. In Media Study sustained 
        attention to developing digital works can be undertaken, with the benefit 
        of a community of fellow artists working in related, and sometimes interrelated 
        media, programming, Web design, video, film, robotics, and net culture. 
        In the Digital Poetics curriculum, theory covered is focused on critical 
        writings by artists, with an emphasis on those being written contemporaneously. 
        Digital Poetics in the Department of Media Study also has the benefit 
        of continual cross-pollination with the notable <font color="#CC9900">Poetics 
        at Buffalo Program</font> -- its renowned faculty and endless wealth of 
        historic literary events -- and those literary connections just make this 
        a much richer place to be, especially for someone with an interest in 
        digital literary studies. We're just the wired side of that sense of innovative 
        practice! When you factor in the presence of the <a href="../index.html"><font color="#FF0000">Electronic 
        Poetry Center</font></a> and the special events it sponsors such as the 
        Language &amp; Encoding symposium, Digital Media Poetics series, and other 
        events, Buffalo is a defining location for emergent digital media literary 
        studies. The EPC also sponsors the much celebrated <a href="../e-poetry/2003"><font color="#FF0000">E-Poetry</font></a> 
        series of international poetry festivals, an artist and practitioner-oriented 
        series of events in the spirit of early medium-defining poetry festivals 
        such as the Vancouver Poetry Festival, 1963, and the Berkeley Poetry Conference, 
        1965. E-Poetry</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
        allows artists the opportunity to engage the state of their art and to 
        advance its possibilities through dialog, performance, and peer interaction. 
        These events offer Media Study students the opportunity to engage the 
        frontiers of the medium as they are being formed and the presence of such 
        practitioners in the artistic community enriches the curriculum and cultural 
        setting of Buffalo's digital literary community. This is supported by 
        Buffalo's unique and vibrant digital arts scene, including the legendary 
        Hallwalls, Big Orbit Sound Lab, Squeaky Wheel, and numerous other venues. 
        <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#CC9900">Digital Poetics at SUNY Buffalo</font></font> 
        offers a new paradigm for writing in the digital age. Join our multi-talented 
        students and renowned faculty in the exploration of the integration of 
        text, image, sound, video, and programming into an engagement with language, 
        our common medium. For more information about Digital Poetics at SUNY
